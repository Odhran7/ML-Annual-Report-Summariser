sustainability 

​ 

at ball corporation we believe in our people our culture and our ability to deliver value to our stakeholders like uncompromising integrity and customer focus sustainability is part of our drive for 10 vision and has been a part of who we are since our founding in 1880 

​ 

our triple bottomline approach to sustainability – environmental economic and social – has evolved over the years and is the lens through which we conduct business at every level of our organization today sustainability is a key part of our business strategy and it influences how we manage and operate our businesses serve our customers care for the environment and our communities secure profits and drive longterm prosperity 

​ 

we focus our sustainability efforts on product stewardship operational excellence human capital management including diversity and inclusion and community engagement in our manufacturing operations around the world we work on continuous improvement of employee safety and engagement energy and water efficiency reducing greenhouse gas emissions waste reduction and recycling our commitment extends beyond our walls

​ 

today’s consumers are acutely aware of the plastic pollution crisis and they are choosing brands based on their sustainability credentials customers understand this growing concern for the environment and their unique position in impacting the environment especially through the packaging materials they use infinitely recyclable and economically valuable aluminum unlocks the full potential of packaging to help customers convey values and purpose to consumers we are committed to doing what we can to move toward a truly circular economy where materials can be – and actually are – used again and again

​ 

aluminum cans bottles and now cups are an increasingly attractive option for sustainabilityconscious brands and consumers who want to do the right thing for the environment unlike plastic glass cartons or compostable containers aluminum containers are designed to be recycled again and again without losing quality and are in high demand across industries and applications pushing aluminum collection sorting and recycling rates to the highest of any beverage packaging material that’s why 75 percent of all aluminum ever produced is still in use today 

​ 

aluminum beverage packaging is the leader in real recycling where the package is collected and then transformed into an item of equal value producttoproduct or materialtomaterial recycling in the case of aluminum cans bottles or cups which are monomaterial the aluminum can be recycled and made back into the same product in as little as 60 days in contrast only 10 percent of all plastic ever produced has been recycled and is mostly only downcycled downcycled products including but not limited to when plastic is converted to become part of a sneaker or fibers in a carpet are not sustainable because eventually those products end up in landfills real recycling happens when the value of the product being recycled is maintained from one use to another 

​ 

because recycling aluminum saves resources and uses significantly less energy than primary aluminum production we are innovating and collaborating with our customers supply chain and other public and private partners to establish and financially support initiatives to increase recycling rates around the world for example we work together to create effective collection and recycling systems and educate consumers about the sustainability benefits of aluminum packaging during 2021 the company proactively engaged with global regulators and legislators to raise awareness of the importance of recycling and infrastructure investment to improve global recycling rates as part of this proactive engagement the company also published the 50 states of recycling report which is available at wwwballcomrealcircularity 

our aerospace business plays a role in sustainability as well more and more our systems are measuring key elements of the physical environment and supporting environmental monitoring and operational weather forecasting programs as well as providing environmental intelligence on weather the earths climate system precipitation drought air pollution vegetation and biodiversity measurements the data captured through ballbuilt instruments and satellites enable an enhanced understanding of the earth’s ecosystem and the stratospheric ozone layer and severe storm tracking and better enabling effective management of natural resources including helping experts to make routine drought assessments and fire prevention plans

​

​ 

our reportable segments 

​ 

ball corporation reports its financial performance in four reportable segments 1 beverage packaging north and central america 2 beverage packaging europe middle east and africa beverage packaging emea 3 beverage packaging south america and 4 aerospace ball also has investments in the us guatemala panama and vietnam that are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and accordingly those results are not included in segment sales or earnings additional financial information related to each of our segments is included in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report on form 10k annual report

beverage packaging north and central america segment 

​ 

beverage packaging north and central america is ball’s largest segment accounting for 42 percent of consolidated net sales in 2021 aluminum beverage containers are primarily sold under multiyear supply contracts to fillers of carbonated soft drinks beer energy drinks and other beverages

​ 

aluminum beverage containers and ends are produced at 20 manufacturing facilities in the us one in canada and two in mexico the beverage packaging north and central america segment also includes interests in four investments that are accounted for using the equity method in 2021 the company began production in its new plants in glendale arizona pittston pennsylvania and bowling green kentucky the company has announced plans to expand its network to include new plants in north las vegas nevada and concord north carolina

​ 

according to publicly available information and company estimates the north american beverage container industry represents approximately 133 billion units six companies manufacture substantially all of the aluminum beverage containers in the us canada and mexico ball shipped approximately 54 billion aluminum beverage containers in north and central america in 2021 which represented approximately 41 percent of the aggregate shipments in these countries historically sales volumes of metal beverage containers in north america tend to be highest during the period from april through september all of the beverage containers produced by ball in the us canada and mexico are made of aluminum in north and central america a diverse base of no less than ten global suppliers provides almost all of our aluminum can and end sheet requirements  

​ 

beverage containers are sold based on price quality service innovation and sustainability in a highly competitive market which is relatively capital intensive and characterized by facilities that run more or less continuously in order to operate profitably in addition the aluminum beverage container competes aggressively with other packaging materials which include meaningful industry positions by the glass bottle in the packaged beer industry and the polyethylene terephthalate pet bottle in the carbonated soft drink and water industries

​ 

we limit our exposure to changes in the cost of aluminum as a result of the inclusion of provisions in most of our aluminum beverage container sales contracts to pass through aluminum price changes as well as through the use of derivative instruments

​ 

beverage packaging emea segment 

​ 

the beverage packaging emea segment accounted for 25 percent of ball’s consolidated net sales in 2021 our emea region operations include 17 facilities throughout europe three facilities in russia and one facility each in cairo egypt and manisa turkey for the countries in which we operate the beverage container market is approximately 93 billion containers and we are the largest producer with an estimated 41 percent of shipments in this region the regions served by our beverage packaging emea segment including russia egypt and turkey are highly regional in terms of sales growth rates and packaging mix four companies manufacture substantially all of the metal beverage containers in emea our emea beverage facilities shipped 38 billion beverage containers in 2021 the vast majority of which were made from aluminum as of december 31 2021 all of the beverage containers produced by the company’s beverage packaging emea segment are now made of aluminum the company has announced plans to construct additional plants in pilsen czech republic ulyanovsk russia and northamptonshire uk

​ 

historically sales volumes of metal beverage containers in emea tend to be highest during the period from may through august with a smaller increase in demand leading up to the winter holiday season in the uk offset by much lower demand in russia much like in other parts of the world the aluminum beverage container competes aggressively with other packaging materials used by the beer and carbonated soft drink industries the glass bottle is heavily utilized in the packaged beer industry while the pet container is utilized in the carbonated soft drink beer juice and water industries these trends are evolving however as customers respond to consumer demand and regulators and nongovernmental organizations press for more sustainable packaging in the wake of the plastic pollution crisis more and more brands are choosing aluminum beverage packaging because of its infinite recyclability and other sustainability credentials the overall recycling rate for aluminum beverage cans in the european union switzerland norway and iceland increased to a new record level of approximately 75 percent in 2017 

​ 

raw material supply contracts in this region generally have longer term agreements six aluminum suppliers provide almost all of our aluminum can and end sheet requirements aluminum is traded primarily in us dollars while the functional currencies of our emea operations are various other currencies the company minimizes its exchange rate risk using derivative and supply contracts in local currencies we limit our exposure to changes in the cost of aluminum as a result of the inclusion of provisions in most of our aluminum beverage container sales contracts to pass through aluminum price changes as well as through the use of derivative instruments

​ 

beverage packaging south america segment 

​ 

the beverage packaging south america segment accounted for 15 percent of ball’s consolidated net sales in 2021 our operations consist of 13 facilities—10 in brazil and one each in argentina chile and paraguay for the countries where we operate the south american beverage container market is approximately 42 billion containers and we are the largest producer in this region with an estimated 48 percent of south american shipments in 2021 four companies currently manufacture substantially all of the aluminum beverage containers in brazil 

​ 

the company’s south american beverage facilities shipped approximately 20 billion aluminum beverage containers in 2021 historically sales volumes of beverage containers in south america tend to be highest during the period from september through december in south america two suppliers provide virtually all our aluminum can and end sheet requirements with certain requirements also being imported from asia

​ 

to support longterm contracted volume growth and canfilling investments across south america the previously announced multiline facility in frutal brazil recently began production in 2021 and additional investments across our existing south american footprint continue 

​ 

we limit our exposure to changes in the cost of aluminum as a result of the inclusion of provisions in most of our aluminum beverage container sales contracts to pass through aluminum price changes as well as through the use of derivative instruments

​ 

aerospace segment 

​ 

ball’s aerospace segment which accounted for 14 percent of consolidated net sales in 2021 includes national defense hardware antenna and video tactical solutions civil and operational space hardware and systems engineering services the segment develops spacecraft sensors and instruments radio frequency systems and other advanced technologies for the civil commercial and national security aerospace markets the majority of the aerospace business involves work under contracts generally from one to five years in duration as a prime contractor or subcontractor for the us department of defense dod the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and other us government agencies the company competes against both large and small prime contractors and subcontractors for these contracts contracts funded by the various agencies of the federal government represented 97 percent of segment sales in 2021

​ 

intense competition and long operating cycles are key characteristics of both the company’s business and the aerospace and defense industry it is common in the aerospace and defense industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to a competitor become a subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting company it is not unusual to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or a customer of that same competitor on other contracts or vice versa

​ 

geopolitical events and shifting executive and legislative branch priorities have resulted in an increase in opportunities over the past decade in areas matching our aerospace segment’s core capabilities in space hardware the businesses include hardware and services sold primarily to us customers with emphasis on space science and exploration climate monitoring weather prediction environmental and earth sciences and defense and intelligence applications major activities frequently involve the design manufacture and testing of satellites remote sensors and ground station control hardware and software as well as related services such as launch vehicle integration and satellite operations 

​ 

other hardware activities include target identification warning and attitude control systems and components cryogenic systems for reactant storage and associated sensor cooling devices star trackers which are generalpurpose stellar attitude sensors and faststeering mirrors 

​ 

backlog represents the estimated transaction prices on performance obligations to our customers for which work remains to be performed backlog in the aerospace segment was 25 billion and 24 billion at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively and consisted of the aggregate contract value of firm orders excluding amounts previously recognized as revenue the 2021 backlog includes 13 billion expected to be recognized in revenues during 2022 with the remainder expected to be recognized in revenues in the years thereafter amounts included in backlog for certain firm government orders which are subject to annual funding were 1 billion and 15 billion at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively yearoveryear comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations revenues and earnings due to the nature of varying delivery and milestone schedules on contracts funding of programs and the uncertainty of timing of future contract awards uncertainties in the federal government budgeting process could delay the funding or even result in cancellation of certain programs currently in our reported backlog

 item 1a risk factors 

​ 

any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition

​ 

general risks 

​ 

if we do not effectively manage change and growth our business could be adversely affected 

​ 

our future revenue and operating results will depend on our ability to effectively manage the anticipated growth of our business we have experienced significant growth in demand for our products and services in recent years and are expanding our operations increasing our headcount and expanding into new product offerings this growth has increased and may continue to constrain our ability to fully supply our customers’ requirements it has also placed significant demands on our management as well as our financial and operational resources and continued growth presents several challenges including

​ 

 ​ 

our business operating results and financial condition are subject to particular risks in certain regions of the world 

​ 

we may experience an operating loss in one or more regions of the world for one or more periods which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition moreover overcapacity which often leads to lower prices may develop over time in certain regions in which we operate even if demand continues to grow more generally supply and demand fluctuations could make it difficult for us to forecast and meet certain customers’ needs our ability to manage such operational fluctuations and to maintain adequate longterm strategies in the face of such developments will be critical to our continued growth and profitability 

​ 

the loss of a key customer or a reduction in its requirements could have a significant negative impact on our sales 

​ 

we sell a majority of our packaging products to a relatively limited number of major beverage personal care and household product companies some of which operate in multiple geographical markets we serve

​ 

although the majority of our customer contracts are longterm these contracts unless they are renewed expire in accordance with their respective terms and are terminable under certain circumstances such as our failure to meet quality volume or market pricing requirements because we depend on a relatively limited number of major customers our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss of any of these customers a reduction in the purchasing levels of these customers a strike or work stoppage by a significant number of these customers’ employees or an adverse change in the terms of the supply agreements with these customers

​ 

the primary customers for our aerospace segment are us government agencies or their prime contractors our contracts with these customers are subject to several risks including funding cuts and delays technical uncertainties budget changes government shutdowns competitive activity and changes in scope

we have a significant level of debt that could have important consequences for our business and any investment in our securities 

​ 

the company had 78 billion of interestbearing debt at december 31 2021 such indebtedness could have significant consequences for our business and any investment in our securities including

​ 

 ​ 

we face competitive risks from many sources that may negatively impact our profitability 

​ 

competition within the packaging and aerospace industries is intense increases in productivity combined with potential surplus capacity in the industry have maintained competitive pricing pressures the principal methods of competition in the general packaging industry are price innovation sustainability service and quality in the aerospace industry they are technical capability cost and schedule some of our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources and some may currently have excess capacity our current or potential competitors may offer products at a lower price or products that are deemed superior to ours the global economic environment has resulted in reductions in demand for our products in some instances which in turn could increase these competitive pressures

​ 

we are subject to competition from alternative products which could result in lower profits and reduced cash flows 

​ 

our aluminum packaging products are subject to significant competition from substitute products particularly plastic carbonated soft drink bottles made from pet single serve beer bottles and other beverage containers made of glass cardboard or other materials competition from plastic carbonated soft drink bottles is particularly intense in the us and europe certain of our aerospace products are also subject to competition from alternative products and solutions there can be no assurance that our products will successfully compete against alternative products which could result in a reduction in our profits or cash flows

​ 

our packaging businesses have a narrow product range and our business would suffer if usage of our products decreased or if decreases occur in the demand for the beverages and other goods filled in our products 

​ 

the majority of our consolidated net sales were from the sale of beverage containers and we expect to derive a significant portion of our future revenues and cash flows from the sale of beverage containers our business would suffer if the use of beverage containers decreased accordingly broad acceptance by consumers of aluminum containers for a wide variety of beverages is critical to our future success if demand for glass and pet bottles increases relative to aluminum containers or the demand for aluminum containers does not develop as expected our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be materially adversely affected

​ 

our business financial condition cash flows and results of operations are subject to risks resulting from broader geographic operations 

​ 

we derived approximately 47 percent of our consolidated net sales from outside of the us for the year ended december 31 2021 the sizeable scope of operations inside and outside of the us may lead to more volatile financial results and make it more difficult for us to manage our business reasons for this include but are not limited to the following

​ 

 ​ 

we are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations 

​ 

the company’s financial results are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations and a significant proportion of assets liabilities and earnings denominated in nonus dollar currencies the company presents its financial statements in us dollars and has a significant proportion of its net assets debt and income in nonus dollar currencies primarily the euro as well as the russian ruble and other emerging market currencies the company’s financial results and capital ratios are therefore sensitive to movements in currency exchange rates 

​ 

we manage our exposure to currency fluctuations particularly our exposure to fluctuations in the euro to us dollar exchange rate to attempt to mitigate the effect of cash flow and earnings volatility associated with exchange rate changes we primarily use forward contracts and options to manage our currency exposures and as a result we experience gains and losses on these derivative positions which are offset in part by the impact of currency fluctuations on existing assets and liabilities 

​ 

we are vulnerable to fluctuations and disruptions in the supply and price of raw materials 

​ 

we purchase aluminum and other raw materials and packaging supplies including dunnage from several sources while all such materials and supplies are available from independent suppliers they are subject to fluctuations in price and availability attributable to a number of factors including general economic conditions commodity price fluctuations particularly aluminum on the london metal exchange the demand by other industries for the same raw materials and the availability of complementary and substitute materials although we enter into commodities purchase agreements from time to time and sometimes use derivative instruments to seek to manage our risk we cannot ensure that our current suppliers of raw materials will be able to supply us with sufficient quantities at reasonable prices economic financial and operational factors including strikes or labor shortages as well as governmental action could impact our suppliers thereby causing supply shortages increases in raw material costs including potential increases due to tariffs sanctions or other trade actions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations global supply chain disruptions can negatively impact our results in the americas europe and asia some contracts do not allow us to pass along increased raw material costs and we generally use derivative agreements to seek to manage this risk our hedging procedures may be insufficient and our results could be materially impacted if costs of materials increase due to the fixedprice contracts increased prices could decrease our sales volume over time the delayed timing in recovering the passthrough of increasing raw material costs may also impact our shortterm profitability and certain costs due to price increases or supply chain inefficiencies may be unrecoverable which would also impact our profitability in addition in view of recent increases in our raw material and other production costs we initiated a comprehensive cost passthrough program across all our businesses last year which is ongoing to seek to recover from our customers the full amount of those cost increases over time

we use estimates in accounting for many of our programs in our aerospace business and changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results 

​ 

we account for sales and profits on a portion of longterm contracts in our aerospace business in accordance with the percentageofcompletion method of accounting using the costtocost method to account for updates in estimates the percentageofcompletion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project revenues and costs at completion and various assumptions and projections related to the outcome of future events including the quantity and timing of product deliveries future labor performance and rates and material and overhead costs these assumptions involve various levels of expected performance improvements under the costtocost method the impact of updates in our estimates related to units shipped to date or progress made to date is recognized immediately

given the significance of the judgments and estimates described above it is likely that we could record materially different amounts if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances or estimates were to change 

​ 

our backlog includes both costtype and fixedprice contracts costtype contracts generally have lower profit margins than fixedprice contracts our earnings and margins may vary depending on the types of government contracts undertaken the nature of the work performed under those contracts the costs incurred in performing the work the achievement of other performance objectives and their impact on our ability to receive fees the fixedprice contracts could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate

​ 

net earnings and net assets could be materially affected by an impairment of goodwill 

​ 

we have a significant amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2021 we are required at least annually to test the recoverability of goodwill the recoverability test of goodwill is based on the current fair value of our identified reporting units fair value measurement requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors including revenue and market growth operating cash flows and discount rates if general market conditions deteriorate in portions of our business we could experience a significant decline in the fair value of our reporting units this decline could lead to an impairment of all or a significant portion of the goodwill balance which could materially affect our us gaap net earnings and net assets 

​ 

if the investments in ball’s pension plans or in the multiemployer pension plans in which ball participates do not perform as expected we may have to contribute additional amounts to the plans which would otherwise be available for other general corporate purposes 

​ 

ball maintains defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of its employees in the united states and a significant number of united kingdom deferred and retired participants which are funded based on certain actuarial assumptions the plans’ assets consist primarily of common stocks fixedincome securities and in the us alternative investments market declines longevity increases or legislative changes such as the pension protection act in the us could result in a prospective decrease in our available cash flow and net earnings over time and the recognition of an increase in our pension obligations could result in a reduction to our shareholders’ equity additional risks exist related to the company’s participation in multiemployer pension plans assets contributed to a multiemployer pension plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers if a participating employer in a multiemployer pension plan stops contributing to the plan the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participants this could result in increases to our contributions to the plans as well as pension expense

​ 

restricted access to capital markets could adversely affect our shortterm liquidity and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the notes issued pursuant to our bond indentures 

​ 

a reduction in global market liquidity could

​ 

 ​ 

if market interest rates increase our variablerate debt will create higher debt service requirements which adversely affects our cash flows while we sometimes enter into agreements limiting our exposure any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk

​ 

the global credit financial and economic environment could have a negative impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

​ 

the overall credit financial and economic environment could have significant negative effects on our operations including

​ 

 ​ 

changes in us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap and sec rules and regulations could materially impact our reported results 

​ 

us gaap and sec accounting and reporting changes are common these changes could have significant effects on our reported results when compared to prior periods and other companies and may even require us to retrospectively adjust prior periods additionally material changes to the presentation of transactions in the consolidated financial statements could impact key ratios that analysts and credit rating agencies use to rate ball and ultimately impact our ability to access the credit markets in an efficient manner

​ 

a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could if not remediated result in material misstatements in our financial statements 

​ 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act a material weakness is defined as a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis if a material weakness is identified management could conclude that internal control over financial reporting is not effective based on criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organization of the treadway commission in “ internal control—an integrated framework 2013” if a material weakness is identified a remediation plan would be designed to address the material weakness if remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weakness or if additional material weaknesses in internal control are discovered or occur in the future our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results as of december 31 2021 the company had no material weaknesses

we face risks related to health epidemics pandemics and other outbreaks including the ongoing covid19 pandemic which could adversely affect our business 

​ 

the circumstances of the ongoing covid19 pandemic and responses thereto continue to evolve the products produced and services provided by ball have been deemed essential and as a result relevant governments around the world have allowed our operations to continue through this crisis additionally overall demand for our aluminum beverage cans has remained high and has increased during the pandemic however covid19 and its related variants could give rise to circumstances that cause one or more of the following risk factors to occur

​ 

 ​ 

because the covid19 pandemic is farreaching and its impacts cannot be completely anticipated additional risks may arise that could materially impact the company’s financial results and liquidity 

​ 

the company has or may implement actions to minimize the risks and associated negative effects from covid19 which do not guarantee the prevention or mitigation of material impacts on our business some of these actions may include and are not limited to

​ 

 ​ 

governmental and regulatory risks 

​ 

changes in laws and governmental regulations may adversely affect our business and operations 

​ 

we and our customers and suppliers are subject to various federal state provincial and local laws and regulations which have been increasing in number and complexity each of our and their facilities is subject to federal state provincial and local licensing and regulation by health environmental workplace safety and other agencies in multiple jurisdictions requirements of worldwide governmental authorities with respect to manufacturing manufacturing facility locations within the jurisdiction product content and safety climate change workplace safety and health environmental expropriation of assets and other standards could adversely affect our ability to manufacture or sell our products and the ability of our customers and suppliers to manufacture and sell their products in addition we face risks arising from compliance with and enforcement of numerous and complex federal state provincial and local laws and regulations

​ 

enacted regulatory developments regarding the reporting and use of “conflict minerals” mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries could affect the sourcing availability and price of minerals used in the manufacture of certain of our products as a result there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflictfree materials and we cannot give assurance that we will be able to obtain such products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices also because our supply chains are complex we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of all materials used in the products that we sell the compliance and reporting aspects of these regulations may result in incremental costs to the company while deposit systems and other containerrelated legislation have been adopted in some jurisdictions similar legislation has been defeated in public referenda and legislative bodies in many others we anticipate that continuing efforts will be made to consider and adopt such legislation in the future the packages we produce are widely used and perform well in us states canadian provinces and european countries that have deposit systems as well as in other countries worldwide

​ 

significant environmental employmentrelated and other legislation and regulatory requirements exist and are also evolving the compliance costs associated with current and proposed laws and potential regulations could be substantial and any failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws or regulations could lead to litigation or governmental action all of which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations

​ 

our aerospace segment is subject to certain risks specific to that business 

​ 

in our aerospace business us government contracts are subject to reduction or modification in the event of changes in requirements and the government may also terminate contracts at its convenience pursuant to standard termination provisions in such instances ball may be entitled to reimbursement for allowable costs and profits on authorized work that has been performed through the date of termination

​ 

in addition budgetary constraints and government shutdowns may result in further reductions to projected spending levels by the us government in particular government expenditures are subject to the potential for automatic reductions generally referred to as “sequestration” sequestration may occur in any given year resulting in significant additional reductions to spending by various us government defense and aerospace agencies on both existing and new contracts as well as the disruption of ongoing programs even if sequestration does not occur we expect that budgetary constraints and ongoing concerns regarding the us national debt will continue to place downward pressure on agency spending levels due to these and other factors overall spending on various programs could decline which could result in significant reductions to revenue cash flows net earnings and backlog primarily in our aerospace segment

​ 

as a us government contractor we could be adversely affected by changes in regulations or any negative findings from a us government audit or investigation 

​ 

our aerospace business operates in a highly regulated environment and is routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its agencies such as the defense contract audit agency dcaa and defense contract management agency dcma these agencies review performance under our contracts our cost structure and our compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies business systems that are subject to review under the dod federal acquisition regulation supplement dfars are purchasing estimating material management and accounting as well as property and earned value management any costs ultimately found to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if already reimbursed if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties sanctions or suspension or debarment from doing business with the us government whether or not illegal activities are alleged the us government also has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate if such actions were to result in suspension or debarment this could have a material adverse effect on our business 

​ 

our business faces the potential of increased regulation on some of the raw materials utilized in our packaging operations 

​ 

our operations are subject to federal state provincial and local laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions relating to some of the raw materials including epoxybased coatings utilized in our container making process epoxybased coatings may contain bisphenola bpa scientific evidence evaluated by regulatory agencies in the us canada europe japan australia and new zealand has consistently shown these coatings to be safe for food contact at current levels and these regulatory agencies have stated that human exposure to bpa from epoxybased container coatings is well below safe exposure limits set by government bodies worldwide a significant change in these regulatory agency statements adverse information concerning bpa or other chemicals present in our coatings or rulings made within certain federal state provincial and local jurisdictions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations ball recognizes that significant interest exists in nonepoxy based coatings and we have been proactively working with coatings suppliers and our customers to transition to alternative coatings

​ 

earnings and cash flows can be impacted by changes in tax laws 

​ 

as a usbased multinational business the company is subject to income tax in the us and numerous jurisdictions outside the us the relevant tax rules and regulations are complex often changing and in some cases are interdependent if these or other tax rules and regulations should change the company’s earnings and cash flows could be impacted

​ 

the company’s worldwide provision for income taxes is determined in part through the use of significant estimates and judgments numerous transactions arise in the ordinary course of business where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain the company undergoes tax examinations by various worldwide tax authorities on a regular basis while the company believes its estimates of its tax obligations are reasonable the final outcome after the conclusion of any tax examinations and any litigation could be materially different from what has been reflected in the company’s historical financial statements

​ 

technological risks 

​ 

decreases in our ability to develop or apply new technology and knowhow may affect our competitiveness 

​ 

our success depends partially on our ability to improve production processes and services we must also introduce new products and services to meet changing customer needs if we are unable to implement better production processes or to develop new products through research and development or licensing of new technology we may not be able to remain competitive with other manufacturers as a result our business financial condition cash flows or results of operations could be adversely affected

​ 

increased information technology it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems networks products solutions and services as well as those of our suppliers and customers 

​ 

the company’s it systems or any third party’s system on which the company relies as well as those of our suppliers and customers could fail on their own accord or may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions or shutdowns including interruptions or shutdowns due to natural disasters power outages or telecommunications failures terrorist attacks or failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software or hardware increased global it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime also pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data as well as to the security and data of our suppliers and customers as a provider of products and services to government and commercial customers our aerospace business in particular may be the target of cyberattacks including attempts to gain unauthorized access to classified or sensitive information and networks the company has a number of shared service centers where many of the company’s it systems are concentrated and any disruption at such a location could impact the company’s business within the operating zones served by the impacted service center 

​ 

while we attempt to mitigate all of these risks to our networks systems and data by employing a number of measures including employee training comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems networks products solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats or other it disruptions depending on their nature and scope such threats could potentially lead to the compromise of confidential information improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data defective products harm to individuals or property contractual or regulatory actions and fines penalties and potential liabilities production downtimes and operational disruptions which in turn could adversely affect our reputation competitiveness and results of operations data privacy and protection laws are evolving and present increasing compliance challenges which may increase our costs affect our competitiveness and could expose us to substantial fines or other penalties in addition a security breach that involves classified or other sensitive government information could subject us to civil or criminal penalties and could result in the loss of our secure facility clearance and other accreditation loss of our government contracts loss of access to classified information or debarment as a government contractor

​ 

human capital risks 

​ 

if we fail to retain key management and personnel we may be unable to implement our key objectives 

​ 

we believe our future success depends in part on our experienced management team unforeseen losses of key members of our management team without appropriate succession andor compensation planning could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet our objectives 

​ 

prolonged work stoppages at facilities with union employees could jeopardize our financial position 

​ 

as of december 31 2021 13 percent of our north american employees and 37 percent of our european employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements these collective bargaining agreements have staggered expirations during the next several years although we consider our employee relations to be generally good a prolonged work stoppage or strike at any facility with union employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows or results of operations in addition we cannot ensure that upon the expiration of existing collective bargaining agreements new agreements will be reached without union action or that any such new agreements will be on terms satisfactory to us

​ 

environmental risks 

​ 

adverse weather and climate changes may result in lower sales 

​ 

we manufacture packaging products primarily for beverages unseasonable weather can reduce demand for certain beverages packaged in our containers climate change and the increasing frequency of severe weather events could have various effects on the demand for our products our supply chain and the costs of inputs to our production and delivery of products in different regions around the world our plants’ production may be prevented or curtailed due to severe or unanticipated weather and climate events

​ 

our business is subject to substantial environmental remediation and compliance costs 

​ 

our operations are subject to federal state provincial and local laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions relating to environmental hazards such as emissions to air discharges to water the handling and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes and the cleanup of hazardous substances we have been designated along with numerous other companies as a potentially responsible party for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites additionally there is increased focus on the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental issues worldwide we strive to mitigate such risks related to environmental issues including through the purchase of renewable energy the adoption of sustainable practices and by positioning ourselves as a sustainability leader in our industry

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

management’s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k annual report which include additional information about our accounting policies practices and the transactions underlying our financial results the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes including various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits taxes environmental and other matters arising during the normal course of business we apply our best judgment our knowledge of existing facts and circumstances and actions that we may undertake in the future in determining the estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances such as current economic conditions and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change as future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision actual results may differ from these estimates ball corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as “ball corporation” “ball” “the company” “we” or “our” in the following discussion and analysis 

​ 

overview 

​ 

business overview and industry trends 

​ 

ball corporation is one of the world’s leading aluminum packaging suppliers our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses are manufactured in facilities around the world and are competitive with other substrates such as plastics and glass in the aluminum packaging industry sales and earnings can be increased by reducing costs increasing prices developing new products expanding volumes and making strategic acquisitions we also provide aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers including national defense hardware antenna and video tactical solutions civil and operational space hardware and system engineering services

​ 

we sell our aluminum packaging products mainly to large multinational beverage personal care and household products companies with which we have developed longterm relationships this is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of longterm supply contracts while we have a diversified customer base we sell a significant portion of our packaging products to major companies and brands as well as to numerous regional customers the overall global aluminum beverage and aerosol container industries are growing and are expected to continue to grow in the medium to long term the primary customers for the products and services provided by our aerospace segment are us government agencies or their prime contractors

​ 

we purchase our raw materials from relatively few suppliers we also have exposure to inflation in particular the rising costs of raw materials as well as other direct cost inputs we mitigate our exposure to the changes in the costs of aluminum through the inclusion of provisions in contracts covering the majority of our volumes to pass through aluminum price changes as well as through the use of derivative instruments the passthrough provisions generally result in proportional increases or decreases in sales and costs with a greatly reduced impact if any on net earnings because of our customer and supplier concentration our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss insolvency or bankruptcy of a major customer or supplier or a change in a supply agreement with a major customer or supplier although our contract provisions generally mitigate the risk of customer loss and our longterm relationships represent a known stable customer base

​ 

the majority of our aerospace business involves work under contracts generally from one to five years in duration as a prime contractor or subcontractor for various us government agencies intense competition and long operating cycles are key characteristics of the company’s aerospace and defense industry where it is common for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to a competitor become a subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting company

​ 

corporate strategy 

​ 

our drive for 10 vision encompasses five strategic levers that are key to growing our business and achieving longterm success since launching drive for 10 in 2011 we have made progress on each of the levers as follows

​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

these ongoing business developments help us stay close to our customers while expanding andor sustaining our industry positions and global reach with major beverage personal care household products and aerospace customers in order to successfully execute our strategy and reach our goals we realize the importance of excelling in the following areas customer focus operational excellence innovation and business development people and culture focus and sustainability

​ 

results of operations 

​ 

management’s discussion and analysis for our results of operations on a consolidated and segment basis include a quantification of factors that had a material impact other factors that did not have a material impact but that are significant to understand the results are qualitatively described

​ 

refer to item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the company’s annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2020 as filed on february 17 2021 for a comparison of our 2020 results of operations to the 2019 results 

​ 

novel coronavirus covid19 

​ 

the ongoing novel coronavirus covid19 had a significant effect upon the global business environment during the year ended december 31 2021 ball provides key products and services to the consumer beverage and household markets and the us aerospace markets and consequently the operations of ball and of its principal customers and suppliers have been designated as essential across our key markets this designation allowed ball to operate its manufacturing facilities throughout 2021 and it is expected that ball will continue to operate its facilities without disruption in the foreseeable future however jurisdictions around the globe have issued stayathome orders and mandated operational closures of nonessential businesses and other restrictions which have impacted certain of our customers by constraining some supply of products to certain consumers the risks that covid19 and its related variants continue to present to ball’s business have been outlined in item 1 risk factors and note 1 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report

​ 

consolidated sales and earnings 

​ 

 ​ 

sales in 2021 were 2030 million higher compared to 2020 primarily as a result of increased sales volumes pass through of higher aluminum prices improved pricemix and favorable exchange rates

​ 

net earnings attributable to ball corporation in 2021 were 293 million higher than 2020 primarily due to increased sales volumes and favorable pricemix in our beverage packaging north and central america segment lower business consolidation and other activities lower total interest expense and higher earnings from equity in results of affiliates partially offset by the tax effect of higher earnings and higher personnel startup and other costs to support growth investments and the timing of contractual nonaluminum input cost recovery

​ 

cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization 

​ 

cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization was 11085 million in 2021 compared to 9323 million in 2020 these amounts represented 80 percent and 79 percent of consolidated net sales for the years ended 2021 and 2020 respectively the increase yearoveryear is primarily due to general inflationary cost pressures from limited supply of raw materials and global supply chain transportation disruptions to mitigate these recent cost trends we have established a commercial cost recovery program that is designed to help us recover a significant portion of those cost increases that fall outside our normal customer contracts

​ 

depreciation and amortization 

​ 

depreciation and amortization expense was 700 million in 2021 compared to 668 million in 2020 these amounts represented 5 percent and 6 percent of consolidated net sales for the years ended 2021 and 2020 respectively amortization expense in 2021 and 2020 included 152 million and 150 million respectively for the amortization of acquired rexam intangibles

​ 

selling general and administrative 

​ 

selling general and administrative sga expenses were 593 million in 2021 compared to 525 million in 2020 these amounts represented 4 percent of consolidated net sales for 2021 and 2020 respectively the increase in sga expenses was primarily due to higher personnel and other costs to support growth investments 

​ 

business consolidation costs and other activities 

​ 

business consolidation costs and other activities were 142 million in 2021 compared to 262 million in 2020 these amounts represented 1 percent and 2 percent of consolidated net sales for 2021 and 2020 respectively the amounts in 2021 included a noncash pension settlement charge of 135 million and gains resulting from brazilian indirect tax rulings of 22 million the charges in 2020 included a noncash pension settlement charge of 120 million a noncash impairment charge of 62 million related to the goodwill of our beverage packaging other reporting unit an adjustment of 15 million to the selling price of the company’s former steel food and steel aerosol business and a 23 million writeoff of the potential future consideration related to the 2019 sale of the company’s former china beverage packaging business

​ 

interest expense 

​ 

total interest expense was 283 million in 2021 compared to 316 million in 2020 interest expense excluding the effect of debt refinancing and other costs as a percentage of average borrowings decreased by approximately 10 basis points from 35 percent 2020 to 34 percent in 2021 due to the drop in global interest rates 

​ 

tax provision 

​ 

the company’s effective tax rate is affected by recurring items such as income earned in nonus jurisdictions with tax rates that differ from the us tax rate and by discrete items that may occur in any given year but are not consistent from year to year 

​ 

the 2021 effective income tax rate was 155 percent compared to 144 percent for 2020 as compared with the statutory us federal income tax rate of 21 percent the 2021 effective rate was reduced by 32 percent for the impact of nonus rate differences including tax holidays by 50 percent for the impact of the us rd credit and by 19 percent for the change in uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties these reductions were partially offset by an increase of 18 percent for the gilti inclusion while these items are expected to recur the potential magnitude of each item is uncertain 

​ 

the 2021 effective income tax rate was also increased by 43 percent for enacted changes in tax laws and rates similar impacts may occur in future periods but given their inherent uncertainty the company is unable to reasonably estimate their potential future impacts

​ 

further details of taxes on income including impacts of the us tax reform are provided in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report

​ 

results of business segments 

​ 

segment results 

​ 

ball’s operations are organized and reviewed by management along its product lines and geographical areas and its operating results are presented in the four reportable segments discussed below

​ 

beverage packaging north and central america 

​ 

 ​ 

segment sales in 2021 were 780 million higher compared to 2020 primarily due to 4 percent volume growth the pass through of higher aluminum prices and improved pricemix 

​ 

comparable operating earnings in 2021 were 2 million lower compared to 2020 primarily due to the timing of contractual nonaluminum input cost recovery startup costs associated with three new multiline manufacturing plants and operational inefficiencies from persistent supply chain disruptions partially offset by higher specialty volumes and improved customer contractual terms 

​ 

beverage packaging emea 

​ 

 ​ 

segment sales in 2021 were 564 million higher compared to 2020 primarily due to 8 percent volume growth the pass through of higher aluminum prices and favorable exchange rates

​ 

comparable operating earnings in 2021 were 98 million higher compared to 2020 primarily due to higher sales volumes and favorable mix

​ 

beverage packaging south america 

​ 

 ​ 

segment sales in 2021 were 321 million higher compared to 2020 primarily due to 3 percent volume growth and the pass through of higher aluminum prices

​ 

comparable operating earnings in 2021 were 68 million higher compared to 2020 primarily related to higher sales volumes and favorable mix

​ 

aerospace 

​ 

 ​ 

segment sales in 2021 were 170 million higher compared to 2020 and comparable operating earnings were 16 million higher primarily due to the company’s new program wins backlog growth and related backlog liquidation through contract performance

​ 

sales to the us government either directly as a prime contractor or indirectly as a subcontractor represented 97 percent of segment sales in both 2021 and 2020 the aerospace contract mix in 2021 consisted of 47 percent costtype contracts which are billed at our costs plus an agreedupon andor earned profit component and 50 percent fixedprice contracts the remaining sales were for time and materials contracts

​ 

backlog for the aerospace segment at december 31 2021 and 2020 was 25 billion and 24 billion respectively the actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower than our estimate of potential contract value the segment has numerous outstanding bids for future contract awards the backlog at december 31 2021 consisted of 40 percent costtype contracts comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations due to the nature of varying delivery and milestone schedules on contracts funding of programs and the uncertainty of timing of future contract awards 

​ 

management performance measures 

​ 

management internally uses various measures to evaluate company performance including comparable operating earnings earnings before interest taxes and business consolidation and other noncomparable costs comparable net earnings earnings before business consolidation costs and other noncomparable costs after tax comparable diluted earnings per share comparable net earnings divided by diluted weighted average shares outstanding return on average invested capital net operating earnings after tax over the relevant performance period divided by average invested capital over the same period economic value added eva® dollars net operating earnings after tax less a capital charge on average invested capital employed earnings before interest and taxes ebit earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda and diluted earnings per share in addition management uses operating cash flows as a measure to evaluate the company’s liquidity we believe this information is also useful to investors as it provides insight into the earnings and cash flow criteria that management uses to make strategic decisions these financial measures may be adjusted at times for items that affect comparability between periods such as business consolidation costs and gains or losses on acquisitions and dispositions

​ 

nonfinancial measures in the packaging businesses include production efficiency and spoilage rates quality control figures environmental health and safety statistics production and sales volume data asset utilization rates and measures of sustainability additional measures used to evaluate financial performance in the aerospace segment include contract revenue realization award and incentive fees realized proposal win rates and backlog references to volume data represent units shipped

​ 

many of the above noted financial measurements are presented on a nonus gaap basis and should be considered in connection with the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report nonus gaap measures should not be considered in isolation nor should they not be considered superior to or a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with us gaap a presentation of earnings in accordance with us gaap is available in item 8 of this annual report

​ 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

​ 

for information regarding the company’s critical and significant accounting policies as well as recent accounting pronouncements see note 1 and note 2 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report

​ 

the company considers certain accounting estimates to be critical as their application is made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations detailed below is a discussion of why to the extent the estimate is material these estimates are subject to uncertainty and the sensitivity of the reported amounts to the methods assumptions and estimates underlying the estimate’s calculation 

​ 

revenue recognition in the aerospace segment 

​ 

sales under fixedprice longterm contracts in the aerospace segment are primarily recognized using percentageofcompletion accounting under the costtocost method the company believes the accounting estimates related to revenue recognition in its aerospace segment are critical accounting estimates because they are highly reliant upon estimation throughout the segment’s contracts with its customers the recognition of revenue requires significant estimation on the part of management including estimating techniques to project revenues and costs at completion and various assumptions and projections related to the outcome of future events and evaluation of estimates of total contract revenue total contract cost and extent of progress toward completion aside from estimation of total contract cost and progress towards completion total revenues in our aerospace segment are subject to uncertainty due to the total amount that will be paid by the customer giving rise to variable consideration the primary types of variable consideration present in the company’s contracts are cost reimbursements performance award fees incremental funding and finalization of government rates the company’s accounting policy around revenue recognition in its aerospace segment and further details of estimates used in revenue recognition in its aerospace segment can be found in note 1 and note 5  respectively to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report

​ 

defined benefit pension plans 

​ 

the company has defined benefit plans which require management to make assumptions relating to the longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rates used to determine the present value of future obligations and expenses salary inflation rates mortality rates and other assumptions the company believes the accounting estimates related to its pension plans are critical accounting estimates because several of the company’s defined benefit plans have significant asset and liability balances and because the assumptions used are highly susceptible to change from period to period based on the performance of plan assets actuarial valuations market conditions and contracted benefit changes these assumptions do not change during the company’s fiscal year unless a remeasurement event occurs in one of the plans such as a significant settlement the assumptions used in accounting for the company’s defined benefit plans and how they have changed over time as well as the sensitivity of the plans to changes in their related assumptions can be found in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

​ 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

​ 

cash flows and capital expenditures 

​ 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities and external borrowings we believe that cash flows from operating activities and cash provided by shortterm longterm and committed revolver borrowings when necessary will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements scheduled principal and interest payments on debt dividend payments anticipated share repurchases and anticipated capital expenditures the following table summarizes our cash flows

​ 

 ​ 

cash flows provided by operating activities were 1760 million in 2021 primarily driven by net earnings depreciation and amortization of 700 million business consolidation and other costs of 142 million and working capital inflows of 120 million partially offset by pension contributions of 207 million in comparison to the same period in 2020 and after adjusting for the impact of capital expenditures our working capital movements reflect an increase in days sales outstanding of 11 days in 2021 an increase in inventory days on hand of 5 days in 2021 and an increase in days payable outstanding of 19 days in 2021 all of which reflect increased aluminum prices during 2021

​ 

cash outflows from investing activities were 1639 million in 2021 predominantly driven by 17 billion in capital expenditures partially offset by 110 million received for the sale of our minorityowned investment in south korea 

​ 

cash outflows from financing activities were 894 million in 2021 primarily driven by net share purchases of 719 million the repayment of 748 million of 5 senior notes and common stock dividends of 229 million partially offset by the issuance of 850 million of 3125 senior notes

​ 

we have entered into several regional committed and uncommitted accounts receivable factoring programs with various financial institutions for certain of our accounts receivable programs accounted for as true sales of the receivables without recourse to ball had combined limits of approximately 17 billion and 16 billion at december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 respectively a total of 308 million and 232 million were available for sale under these programs at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

​ 

as of december 31 2021 approximately 499 million of our cash was held outside of the us in the event we need to utilize any of the cash held outside of the us for purposes within the us there are no material legal or other economic restrictions regarding the repatriation of cash from any of the countries outside the us where we have cash the company believes its us operating cash flows cash on hand as well as availability under its longterm revolving credit facilities uncommitted shortterm credit facilities and committed and uncommitted accounts receivable factoring programs will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of the us portion of our ongoing operations scheduled principal and interest payments on us debt dividend payments capital expenditures and other us cash requirements if nonus funds are needed for our us cash requirements and we are unable to provide the funds through intercompany financing arrangements we would be required to repatriate funds from nonus locations where the company has previously asserted indefinite reinvestment of funds outside the us 

​ 

based on its indefinite reinvestment assertion the company has not provided deferred taxes on earnings in certain nonus subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in its international operations it is not practical to estimate the additional taxes that might become payable if these earnings were remitted to the us

​ 

share repurchases 

​ 

the company’s share repurchases net of issuances totaled 719 million in 2021 and 75 million in 2020 the repurchases were completed using cash on hand cash provided by operating activities proceeds from the sale of businesses and available borrowings 

​ 

debt facilities and refinancing 

​ 

given our cash flow projections and unused credit facilities that are available until march 2024 our liquidity is strong and is expected to meet our ongoing cash and debt service requirements total interestbearing debt was 78 billion at both december 31 2021 and 2020

​ 

during 2021 ball issued 850 million of 3125 senior notes due in 2031 and redeemed the outstanding 5 senior notes due in march 2022 in the amount of 748 million

​ 

at december 31 2021 taking into account outstanding letters of credit approximately 17 billion was available under the company’s longterm multicurrency committed revolving credit facilities which are available until march 2024 in addition to these facilities the company had 1 billion of shortterm uncommitted credit facilities available at december 31 2021 of which 12 million was outstanding and due on demand 

​ 

while ongoing financial and economic conditions in certain areas may raise concerns about credit risk with counterparties to derivative transactions the company mitigates its exposure by allocating the risk among various counterparties and limiting exposure to any one party we also monitor the credit ratings of our suppliers customers lenders and counterparties on a regular basis

​ 

some of ball’s loan agreements use the london interbank offered rate libor in determining interest rates the company is currently evaluating the impact that the transition from its liborbased interest rate loan agreements to secured overnight financing rate sofr based interest rate agreements will have on its consolidated financial statements based on our most current understanding the libor to sofr transition is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

​ 

we were in compliance with all loan agreements at december 31 2021 and for all prior years presented and we have met all debt payment obligations the us note agreements and bank credit agreement contain certain restrictions relating to dividends investments financial ratios guarantees and the incurrence of additional indebtedness the most restrictive of our debt covenants requires us to maintain a leverage ratio as defined of no greater than 50 times which will change to 45 times as of december 31 2022 as of december 31 2021 the company could borrow up to the limits available under its longterm multicurrency committed revolving facilities and shortterm uncommitted credit facilities without violating any of its existing debt covenants additional details about our debt are available in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report

​ 

defined benefit pension plans 

​ 

the company closed its pension plans to all nonunionized new entrants in the united states effective for anyone hired after december 31 2021 new employees will instead receive a nonelective 401k company contribution that is expected to approximate the legacy pension benefit anyone employed by ball prior to that date is unaffected by this change

​ 

other liquidity measures 

​ 

given the ongoing growth projects in our businesses being undertaken to support evaenchancing contacted volumes in 2022 we expect capital expenditures to exceed 2 billion and we intend to return approximately 175 billion to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases and dividends we further intend to utilize our operating cash flows to service debt requirements and to the extent available acquisitions that meet our rate of return criteria

​ 

we have committed contracts to purchase raw materials and we align these purchase commitments with longterm sales contracts with our customers such that any commitment to purchase aluminum and other direct materials corresponds to a contractual sale these aluminum purchase commitments include passthrough provisions which generally result in proportional changes in both sales and costs of sales

​ 

the company’s growth plans will require significant capital expenditures over the next years these capital expenditures will be funded by operating cash flows and external borrowings approximately 12 billion of capital expenditures were contractually committed as of december 31 2021 maturities for ball’s longterm debt are disclosed in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report repayments of debt and other operational cash requirements will also be funded by operating cash flows and external borrowings the company has no material offbalance sheet arrangements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

​ 

financial instruments and risk management 

​ 

the company employs established risk management policies and procedures which seek to reduce the company’s commercial risk exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices interest rates currency exchange rates and prices of the company’s common stock with regard to common share repurchases and the company’s deferred compensation stock plan however there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be successful although the instruments utilized involve varying degrees of credit market and interest risk the counterparties to the agreements are expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements the company monitors counterparty credit risk including lenders on a regular basis but ball cannot be certain that all risks will be discerned or that its risk management policies and procedures will always be effective additionally in the event of default under the company’s master derivative agreements the nondefaulting party has the option to set off any amounts owed with regard to open derivative positions 

​ 

we have estimated our market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis market risk exposure has been defined as the changes in fair value of derivative instruments financial instruments and commodity positions to test the sensitivity of our market risk exposure we have estimated the changes in fair value of market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in market prices or rates the results of the sensitivity analyses are summarized below

​ 

commodity price risk 

​ 

aluminum 

​ 

we manage commodity price risk in connection with market price fluctuations of aluminum through two different methods first we enter into container sales contracts that include aluminumbased pricing terms that generally reflect the same price fluctuations included in commercial purchase contracts for aluminum sheet the terms include fixed floating or passthrough aluminum component pricing second we use derivative instruments such as option and forward contracts as economic and cash flow hedges of commodity price risk where there are material differences between sales and purchase contracted pricing and volume

​ 

considering the effects of derivative instruments the company’s ability to pass through certain raw material costs through contractual provisions the market’s ability to accept price increases and the company’s commodity price exposures under its contract terms a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the company’s aluminum prices would result in an estimated 4 million aftertax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period additionally the company has currency exposures on raw materials and the effect of a 10 percent adverse change is included in the total currency exposure discussed below actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates

​ 

interest rate risk 

​ 

our objective in managing exposure to interest rate changes is to minimize the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to minimize our overall borrowing and receivables factoring costs to achieve these objectives we may use a variety of interest rate swaps collars and options to manage our mix of floating and fixedrate debt interest rate instruments held by the company at december 31 2021 included payfixed interest rate swaps and options which effectively convert variable rate obligations to fixedrate instruments

​ 

based on our interest rate exposure at december 31 2021 assumed floating rate debt levels throughout the next 12 months and the effects of our existing derivative instruments a 100basis point increase in interest rates would result in an estimated 3 million aftertax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates and the timing of these changes

​ 

currency exchange rate risk 

​ 

our objective in managing exposure to currency fluctuations is to limit the exposure of cash flows and earnings from changes associated with currency exchange rate changes through the use of various derivative contracts in addition at times ball manages earnings translation volatility through the use of currency option strategies and the change in the fair value of those options is recorded in the company’s net earnings our currency translation risk results from the currencies in which we transact business the company faces currency exposures in our global operations as a result of various factors including intercompany currency denominated loans selling our products in various currencies purchasing raw materials and equipment in various currencies and tax exposures not denominated in the functional currency sales contracts are negotiated with customers to reflect cost changes and where there is not an exchange passthrough arrangement the company may use forward and option contracts to manage significant currency exposures

​ 

considering the company’s derivative financial instruments outstanding at december 31 2021 and the various currency exposures a hypothetical 10 percent reduction us dollar strengthening in currency exchange rates compared to the us dollar would result in an estimated 13 million aftertax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period this hypothetical adverse change in the us dollar’s currency exchange rates would also increase our forecasted average debt balance by 227 million actual changes in market prices or rates may differ from hypothetical changes

​ 

sustainability 

​ 

at ball corporation we believe in our people our culture and our ability to deliver value to our stakeholders like uncompromising integrity and customer focus sustainability is part of our drive for 10 vision and has been a part of who we are since our founding in 1880 

​ 

our triple bottomline approach to sustainability – environmental economic and social – has evolved over the years and is the lens through which we conduct business at every level of our organization today sustainability is a key part of our business strategy and it influences how we manage and operate our businesses serve our customers care for the environment and our communities secure profits and drive longterm prosperity 

​ 

we focus our sustainability efforts on product stewardship operational excellence human capital management and community engagement in our manufacturing operations around the world we work on continuous improvement of employee safety and engagement energy and water efficiency reducing air emissions and waste reduction and recycling and our commitment extends beyond our walls

​ 

today’s consumers are acutely aware of the plastic pollution crisis and they are choosing brands based on their sustainability credentials customers understand this growing concern for the environment and their unique position in impacting the environment especially through the packaging materials they use infinitely recyclable and economically valuable aluminum unlocks the full potential of packaging to help customers convey values and purpose to consumers

​ 

aluminum cans bottles and now cups are an increasingly attractive option for sustainabilityconscious brands and consumers who want to do the right thing for the environment unlike plastic glass cartons or compostable containers aluminum can be recycled again and again without losing quality and is in high demand across industries and applications pushing its collection sorting and recycling rates to the highest of any beverage packaging material that’s why 75 percent of all aluminum ever produced is still in use today 

​ 

in 2017 resource recycling systems recognized aluminum beverage cans as the most recycled beverage package in the world with a global average recycling rate of 69 percent in comparison only 43 percent of pet and 46 percent of glass bottles were collected although not necessarily recycled these findings solidify aluminum beverage packaging as the leader in real recycling where the package is collected and then transformed into an item of equal value producttoproduct or materialtomaterial recycling in the case of aluminum cans bottles or cups which are monomaterial the aluminum can be recycled and made back into the same product in as little as 60 days in contrast only nine percent of all plastic ever produced has been recycled and mostly it’s only downcycled downcycled products including but not limited to when plastic is converted to become part of a sneaker or fibers in a carpet is not sustainable because eventually those products end up in landfills real recycling happens when the value of the product being recycled is maintained from one use to another 

​ 

because recycling aluminum saves resources and uses significantly less energy than primary aluminum production we are innovating and collaborating with our customers supply chain and other public and private partners to establish and financially support initiatives to increase recycling rates around the world for example we work together to create effective collection and recycling systems and educate consumers about the sustainability benefits of aluminum packaging 

​ 

our aerospace business plays a role in sustainability as well more and more our systems are measuring key elements of the physical environment and supporting environmental monitoring and operational weather forecasting programs as well as providing environmental intelligence on weather the earths climate system precipitation drought air pollution vegetation and biodiversity measurements the data captured through ballbuilt instruments and satellites enable an enhanced understanding of the earth’s ecosystem and the stratospheric ozone layer and severe storm tracking and better enabling effective management of natural resources including helping experts to make routine drought assessments and fire prevention plans

​

our reportable segments 

​ 

ball corporation reports its financial performance in four reportable segments 1 beverage packaging north and central america 2 beverage packaging europe middle east and africa beverage packaging emea 3 beverage packaging south america and 4 aerospace ball also has investments in the us guatemala panama south korea and vietnam that are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and accordingly those results are not included in segment sales or earnings financial information related to each of our segments is included in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report on form 10k annual report

​ 

effective january 1 2020 ball implemented changes to its management and internal reporting structure for cost reduction and operational efficiency purposes as a result of these changes the company’s plants in cairo egypt and manisa turkey are now included in the beverage packaging emea segment in addition the company’s operations in india and saudi arabia are now combined with the former nonreportable beverage packaging asia pacific operating segment as a new nonreportable beverage packaging other operating segment the company’s segment results and disclosures for historical comparative periods have been retrospectively adjusted to conform to the current year presentation

​ 

beverage packaging north and central america segment 

​ 

beverage packaging north and central america is ball’s largest segment accounting for 43 percent of consolidated net sales in 2020 aluminum beverage containers are primarily sold under multiyear supply contracts to fillers of carbonated soft drinks beer energy drinks and other beverages

​ 

aluminum beverage containers and ends are produced at 18 manufacturing facilities in the us one in canada and two in mexico the beverage packaging north and central america segment also includes interests in three joint ventures that are accounted for using the equity method the company has announced plans to expand its network to pittston pennsylvania and bowling green kentucky

​ 

according to publicly available information and company estimates the north american beverage container industry represents approximately 121 billion units five companies manufacture substantially all of the aluminum beverage containers in the us canada and mexico ball shipped approximately 51 billion aluminum beverage containers in north america in 2020 which represented approximately 42 percent of the aggregate shipments in these countries historically sales volumes of metal beverage containers in north america tend to be highest during the period from april through september all of the beverage containers produced by ball in the us canada and mexico are made of aluminum in north and central america a diverse base of no less than 10 global suppliers provides almost all of our aluminum can and end sheet requirements  

​ 

beverage containers are sold based on price quality service innovation and sustainability in a highly competitive market which is relatively capital intensive and characterized by facilities that run more or less continuously in order to operate profitably in addition the aluminum beverage container competes aggressively with other packaging materials which include meaningful industry positions by the glass bottle in the packaged beer industry and the polyethylene terephthalate pet bottle in the carbonated soft drink and water industries

​ 

we limit our exposure to changes in the cost of aluminum as a result of the inclusion of provisions in most of our aluminum beverage container sales contracts to pass through aluminum price changes as well as through the use of derivative instruments

​ 

beverage packaging emea segment 

​ 

the beverage packaging emea segment accounted for 25 percent of ball’s consolidated net sales in 2020 our operations consist of 17 facilities throughout europe three facilities in russia and one facility each in cairo egypt and manisa turkey for the countries in which we operate the beverage container market is approximately 80 billion containers and we are the largest producer with an estimated 43 percent of shipments in this region the regions served by our beverage packaging emea segment including russia egypt and turkey are highly regional in terms of sales growth rates and packaging mix four companies manufacture substantially all of the metal beverage containers in emea our emea beverage facilities shipped 35 billion beverage containers in 2020 the vast majority of which were produced from aluminum the company has announced plans to construct an additional plant in pilsen czech republic

​ 

historically sales volumes of metal beverage containers in emea tend to be highest during the period from may through august with a smaller increase in demand leading up to the winter holiday season in the uk offset by much lower demand in russia much like in other parts of the world the aluminum beverage container competes aggressively with other packaging materials used by the beer and carbonated soft drink industries the glass bottle is heavily utilized in the packaged beer industry while the pet container is utilized in the carbonated soft drink beer juice and water industries these trends are evolving however as customers respond to consumer demand and regulators and nongovernmental organizations press for more sustainable packaging in the wake of the plastic pollution crisis more and more brands are choosing aluminum beverage packaging because of its infinite recyclability and other sustainability credentials the overall recycling rate for aluminum beverage cans in the european union switzerland norway and iceland increased to a new record level of approximately 75 percent in 2017

​ 

raw material supply contracts in this region generally have longer term agreements five aluminum suppliers provide almost all of our aluminum can and end sheet requirements aluminum is traded primarily in us dollars while the functional currencies of our emea operations are various other currencies the company minimizes its exchange rate risk using derivative and supply contracts in local currencies purchase and sales contracts generally include fixedprice floating or passthrough aluminum ingot component pricing arrangements

​ 

beverage packaging south america segment 

​ 

the beverage packaging south america segment accounted for 14 percent of ball’s consolidated net sales in 2020 our operations consist of 12 facilities 9 in brazil and one each in argentina chile and paraguay for the countries where we operate the south american beverage container market is approximately 39 billion containers and we are the largest producer in this region with an estimated 50 percent of south american shipments in 2020 four companies currently manufacture substantially all of the aluminum beverage containers in brazil 

​ 

the company’s south american beverage facilities shipped approximately 20 billion aluminum beverage containers in 2020 historically sales volumes of beverage containers in south america tend to be highest during the period from september through december in south america two suppliers provide virtually all our aluminum sheet requirements with certain requirements also being imported from asia

​ 

in order to support contracted volumes for aluminum beverage packaging across paraguay argentina and bolivia the company constructed a oneline beverage can and end manufacturing facility in paraguay which began production in the fourth quarter of 2019 and increased capacity to its buenos aires argentina and santiago chile facilities the company has announced plans to construct an additional plant in frutal brazil

​ 

we limit our exposure to changes in the cost of aluminum as a result of the inclusion of provisions in most of our aluminum beverage container sales contracts to pass through aluminum price changes as well as through the use of derivative instruments

​ 

aerospace segment 

​ 

ball’s aerospace segment which accounted for 15 percent of consolidated net sales in 2020 includes national defense hardware antenna and video tactical solutions civil and operational space hardware and systems engineering services the segment develops spacecraft sensors and instruments radio frequency systems and other advanced technologies for the civil commercial and national security aerospace markets the majority of the aerospace business involves work under contracts generally from one to five years in duration as a prime contractor or subcontractor for the us department of defense dod the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and other us government agencies the company competes against both large and small prime contractors and subcontractors for these contracts contracts funded by the various agencies of the federal government represented 97 percent of segment sales in 2020

​ 

intense competition and long operating cycles are key characteristics of both the company’s business and the aerospace and defense industry it is common in the aerospace and defense industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to a competitor become a subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting company it is not unusual to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or a customer of that same competitor on other contracts or vice versa

​ 

geopolitical events and shifting executive and legislative branch priorities have resulted in an increase in opportunities over the past decade in areas matching our aerospace segment’s core capabilities in space hardware the businesses include hardware and services sold primarily to us customers with emphasis on space science and exploration climate monitoring weather prediction environmental and earth sciences and defense and intelligence applications major activities frequently involve the design manufacture and testing of satellites remote sensors and ground station control hardware and software as well as related services such as launch vehicle integration and satellite operations 

​ 

other hardware activities include target identification warning and attitude control systems and components cryogenic systems for reactant storage and associated sensor cooling devices star trackers which are generalpurpose stellar attitude sensors and faststeering mirrors 

​ 

contracted backlog in the aerospace segment was 24 billion and 25 billion at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively and consisted of the aggregate contract value of firm orders excluding amounts previously recognized as revenue the 2020 contracted backlog includes 14 billion expected to be recognized in revenues during 2021 with the remainder expected to be recognized in revenues in the years thereafter amounts included in backlog for certain firm government orders which are subject to annual funding were 15 billion and 16 billion at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively yearoveryear comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations revenues and earnings due to the nature of varying delivery and milestone schedules on contracts funding of programs and the uncertainty of timing of future contract awards uncertainties in the federal government budgeting process could delay the funding or even result in cancellation of certain programs currently in our reported backlog

 item 1a risk factors 

​ 

any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition

​ 

general risks 

​ 

if we do not effectively manage change and growth our business could be adversely affected 

​ 

our future revenue and operating results will depend on our ability to effectively manage the anticipated growth of our business we have experienced significant growth in demand for our products and services in recent years and are expanding our operations increasing our headcount and expanding into new product offerings this growth has increased and may continue to constrain our ability to fully supply our customers’ requirements it has also placed significant demands on our management as well as our financial and operational resources and continued growth presents several challenges including

​ 

 ​ 

our business operating results and financial condition are subject to particular risks in certain regions of the world 

​ 

we may experience an operating loss in one or more regions of the world for one or more periods which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition moreover overcapacity which often leads to lower prices may develop over time in certain regions in which we operate even if demand continues to grow more generally supply and demand fluctuations could make it difficult for us to forecast and meet certain customers’ needs our ability to manage such operational fluctuations and to maintain adequate longterm strategies in the face of such developments will be critical to our continued growth and profitability 

​ 

the loss of a key customer or a reduction in its requirements could have a significant negative impact on our sales 

​ 

we sell a majority of our packaging products to a relatively limited number of major beverage personal care and household product companies some of which operate in multiple geographical markets we serve

​ 

although the majority of our customer contracts are longterm these contracts unless they are renewed expire in accordance with their respective terms and are terminable under certain circumstances such as our failure to meet quality volume or market pricing requirements because we depend on a relatively limited number of major customers our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss of any of these customers a reduction in the purchasing levels of these customers a strike or work stoppage by a significant number of these customers’ employees or an adverse change in the terms of the supply agreements with these customers

​ 

the primary customers for our aerospace segment are us government agencies or their prime contractors our contracts with these customers are subject to several risks including funding cuts and delays technical uncertainties budget changes government shutdowns competitive activity and changes in scope

we have a significant level of debt that could have important consequences for our business and any investment in our securities 

​ 

the company had 78 billion of interestbearing debt at december 31 2020 such indebtedness could have significant consequences for our business and any investment in our securities including

​ 

 ​ 

we face competitive risks from many sources that may negatively impact our profitability 

​ 

competition within the packaging and aerospace industries is intense increases in productivity combined with potential surplus capacity in the industry have maintained competitive pricing pressures the principal methods of competition in the general packaging industry are price innovation sustainability service and quality in the aerospace industry they are technical capability cost and schedule some of our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources and some may currently have excess capacity our current or potential competitors may offer products at a lower price or products that are deemed superior to ours the global economic environment has resulted in reductions in demand for our products in some instances which in turn could increase these competitive pressures

​ 

we are subject to competition from alternative products which could result in lower profits and reduced cash flows 

​ 

our aluminum packaging products are subject to significant competition from substitute products particularly plastic carbonated soft drink bottles made from pet single serve beer bottles and other beverage containers made of glass cardboard or other materials competition from plastic carbonated soft drink bottles is particularly intense in the us and europe certain of our aerospace products are also subject to competition from alternative products and solutions there can be no assurance that our products will successfully compete against alternative products which could result in a reduction in our profits or cash flows

​ 

our packaging businesses have a narrow product range and our business would suffer if usage of our products decreased or if decreases occur in the demand for the beverages and other goods filled in our products 

​ 

the majority of our consolidated net sales were from the sale of beverage containers and we expect to derive a significant portion of our future revenues and cash flows from the sale of beverage containers our business would suffer if the use of beverage containers decreased accordingly broad acceptance by consumers of aluminum containers for a wide variety of beverages is critical to our future success if demand for glass and pet bottles increases relative to aluminum containers or the demand for aluminum containers does not develop as expected our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be materially adversely affected

​ 

our business financial condition cash flows and results of operations are subject to risks resulting from broader geographic operations 

​ 

we derived approximately 46 percent of our consolidated net sales from outside of the us for the year ended december 31 2020 the sizeable scope of operations inside and outside of the us may lead to more volatile financial results and make it more difficult for us to manage our business reasons for this include but are not limited to the following

​ 

 ​ 

we are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations 

​ 

the company’s financial results are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations and a significant proportion of assets liabilities and earnings denominated in nonus dollar currencies the company presents its financial statements in us dollars and has a significant proportion of its net assets debt and income in nonus dollar currencies primarily the euro as well as the russian ruble and other emerging market currencies the company’s financial results and capital ratios are therefore sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates 

​ 

we manage our exposure to currency fluctuations particularly our exposure to fluctuations in the euro to us dollar exchange rate to attempt to mitigate the effect of cash flow and earnings volatility associated with exchange rate changes we primarily use forward contracts and options to manage our currency exposures and as a result we experience gains and losses on these derivative positions offset in part by the impact of currency fluctuations on existing assets and liabilities 

​ 

we are vulnerable to fluctuations in the supply and price of raw materials 

​ 

we purchase aluminum and other raw materials and packaging supplies from several sources while all such materials are available from independent suppliers raw materials are subject to fluctuations in price and availability attributable to a number of factors including general economic conditions commodity price fluctuations particularly aluminum on the london metal exchange the demand by other industries for the same raw materials and the availability of complementary and substitute materials although we enter into commodities purchase agreements from time to time and sometimes use derivative instruments to seek to manage our risk we cannot ensure that our current suppliers of raw materials will be able to supply us with sufficient quantities at reasonable prices economic financial and operational factors including strikes or labor shortages as well as governmental action could impact our suppliers thereby causing supply shortages increases in raw material costs including potential increases due to tariffs sanctions or other trade actions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in the americas europe and asia some contracts do not allow us to pass along increased raw material costs and we generally use derivative agreements to seek to manage this risk our hedging procedures may be insufficient and our results could be materially impacted if costs of materials increase due to the fixedprice contracts and derivative activities while increasing raw material costs may not impact our nearterm profitability increased prices could decrease our sales volume over time

​ 

we use estimates in accounting for many of our programs in our aerospace business and changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results 

​ 

we account for sales and profits on a portion of longterm contracts in our aerospace business in accordance with the percentageofcompletion method of accounting using the costtocost method to account for updates in estimates the percentageofcompletion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project revenues and costs at completion and various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events including the quantity and timing of product deliveries future labor performance and rates and material and overhead costs these assumptions involve various levels of expected performance improvements under the costtocost method the impact of updates in our estimates related to units shipped to date or progress made to date is recognized immediately

given the significance of the judgments and estimates described above it is likely that we could record materially different amounts if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances or estimates were to change 

​ 

our backlog includes both costtype and fixedprice contracts costtype contracts generally have lower profit margins than fixedprice contracts our earnings and margins may vary depending on the types of government contracts undertaken the nature of the work performed under those contracts the costs incurred in performing the work the achievement of other performance objectives and their impact on our ability to receive fees the fixedprice contracts could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate

​ 

net earnings and net assets could be materially affected by an impairment of goodwill 

​ 

we have a significant amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2020 we are required at least annually to test the recoverability of goodwill the recoverability test of goodwill is based on the current fair value of our identified reporting units fair value measurement requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors including revenue and market growth operating cash flows and discount rates if general market conditions deteriorate in portions of our business we could experience a significant decline in the fair value of our reporting units this decline could lead to an impairment of all or a significant portion of the goodwill balance which could materially affect our us gaap net earnings and net assets 

​ 

if the investments in ball’s pension plans or in the multiemployer pension plans in which ball participates do not perform as expected we may have to contribute additional amounts to the plans which would otherwise be available for other general corporate purposes 

​ 

ball maintains defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of its employees in the united states and a significant number of united kingdom deferred and retired participants which are funded based on certain actuarial assumptions the plans’ assets consist primarily of common stocks fixedincome securities and in the us alternative investments market declines longevity increases or legislative changes such as the pension protection act in the us could result in a prospective decrease in our available cash flow and net earnings over time and the recognition of an increase in our pension obligations could result in a reduction to our shareholders’ equity additional risks exist related to the company’s participation in multiemployer pension plans assets contributed to a multiemployer pension plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers if a participating employer in a multiemployer pension plan stops contributing to the plan the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participants this could result in increases to our contributions to the plans as well as pension expense

​ 

restricted access to capital markets could adversely affect our shortterm liquidity and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the notes issued pursuant to our bond indentures 

​ 

a reduction in global market liquidity could

​ 

 ​ 

if market interest rates increase our variablerate debt will create higher debt service requirements which adversely affects our cash flows while we sometimes enter into agreements limiting our exposure any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk

​ 

the global credit financial and economic environment could have a negative impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

​ 

the overall credit financial and economic environment could have significant negative effects on our operations including

​ 

 ​ 

changes in us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap and sec rules and regulations could materially impact our reported results 

​ 

us gaap and sec accounting and reporting changes are common and have become more frequent and significant over the past several years these changes could have significant effects on our reported results when compared to prior periods and other companies and may even require us to retrospectively adjust prior periods additionally material changes to the presentation of transactions in the consolidated financial statements could impact key ratios that analysts and credit rating agencies use to rate ball and ultimately impact our ability to access the credit markets in an efficient manner

​ 

a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could if not remediated result in material misstatements in our financial statements 

​ 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act a material weakness is defined as a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis if a material weakness is identified management could conclude that internal control over financial reporting is not effective based on criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organization of the treadway commission in “ internal control—an integrated framework 2013” if a material weakness is identified a remediation plan would be designed to address the material weakness if remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weakness or if additional material weaknesses in internal control are discovered or occur in the future our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results as of december 31 2020 the company had no material weaknesses

​ 

we face risks related to health epidemics pandemics and other outbreaks including the current covid19 pandemic which could adversely affect our business 

​ 

the circumstances of the current covid19 pandemic and responses thereto continue to evolve the products produced and services provided by ball have been deemed essential and as a result relevant governments around the world have allowed our operations to continue through this crisis additionally overall demand for our aluminum beverage cans has remained high and has increased during the pandemic however covid19 could give rise to circumstances that cause one or more of the following risk factors to occur

​ 



 ​ 

because the covid19 pandemic is farreaching and its impacts cannot be completely anticipated additional risks may arise that could materially impact the company’s financial results and liquidity 

​ 

the company has or may implement actions to minimize the risks and associated negative effects from covid19 which do not guarantee the prevention or mitigation of material impacts on our business some of these actions may include and are not limited to 

​ 

 ​ 

governmental and regulatory risks 

​ 

changes in laws and governmental regulations may adversely affect our business and operations 

​ 

we and our customers and suppliers are subject to various federal state provincial and local laws and regulations which have been increasing in number and complexity each of our and their facilities is subject to federal state provincial and local licensing and regulation by health environmental workplace safety and other agencies in multiple jurisdictions requirements of worldwide governmental authorities with respect to manufacturing manufacturing facility locations within the jurisdiction product content and safety climate change workplace safety and health environmental expropriation of assets and other standards could adversely affect our ability to manufacture or sell our products and the ability of our customers and suppliers to manufacture and sell their products in addition we face risks arising from compliance with and enforcement of numerous and complex federal state provincial and local laws and regulations

​ 

enacted regulatory developments regarding the reporting and use of “conflict minerals” mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries could affect the sourcing availability and price of minerals used in the manufacture of certain of our products as a result there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflictfree materials and we cannot give assurance that we will be able to obtain such products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices also because our supply chains are complex we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of all materials used in the products that we sell the compliance and reporting aspects of these regulations may result in incremental costs to the company while deposit systems and other containerrelated legislation have been adopted in some jurisdictions similar legislation has been defeated in public referenda and legislative bodies in many others we anticipate that continuing efforts will be made to consider and adopt such legislation in the future the packages we produce are widely used and perform well in us states canadian provinces and european countries that have deposit systems as well as in other countries worldwide

​ 

significant environmental employmentrelated and other legislation and regulatory requirements exist and are also evolving the compliance costs associated with current and proposed laws and potential regulations could be substantial and any failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws or regulations could lead to litigation or governmental action all of which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations

​ 

our aerospace segment is subject to certain risks specific to that business 

​ 

in our aerospace business us government contracts are subject to reduction or modification in the event of changes in requirements and the government may also terminate contracts at its convenience pursuant to standard termination provisions in such instances ball may be entitled to reimbursement for allowable costs and profits on authorized work that has been performed through the date of termination

​ 

in addition budgetary constraints and government shutdowns may result in further reductions to projected spending levels by the us government in particular government expenditures are subject to the potential for automatic reductions generally referred to as “sequestration” sequestration may occur in any given year resulting in significant additional reductions to spending by various us government defense and aerospace agencies on both existing and new contracts as well as the disruption of ongoing programs even if sequestration does not occur we expect that budgetary constraints and ongoing concerns regarding the us national debt will continue to place downward pressure on agency spending levels due to these and other factors overall spending on various programs could decline which could result in significant reductions to revenue cash flows net earnings and backlog primarily in our aerospace segment

​ 

as a us government contractor we could be adversely affected by changes in regulations or any negative findings from a us government audit or investigation 

​ 

our aerospace business operates in a highly regulated environment and is routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its agencies such as the defense contract audit agency dcaa and defense contract management agency dcma these agencies review performance under our contracts our cost structure and our compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies business systems that are subject to review under the dod federal acquisition regulation supplement dfars are purchasing estimating material management and accounting as well as property and earned value management any costs ultimately found to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if already reimbursed if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties sanctions or suspension or debarment from doing business with the us government whether or not illegal activities are alleged the us government also has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate if such actions were to result in suspension or debarment this could have a material adverse effect on our business 

​ 

our business faces the potential of increased regulation on some of the raw materials utilized in our packaging operations 

​ 

our operations are subject to federal state provincial and local laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions relating to some of the raw materials including epoxybased coatings utilized in our container making process epoxybased coatings may contain bisphenola bpa scientific evidence evaluated by regulatory agencies in the us canada europe japan australia and new zealand has consistently shown these coatings to be safe for food contact at current levels and these regulatory agencies have stated that human exposure to bpa from epoxybased container coatings is well below safe exposure limits set by government bodies worldwide a significant change in these regulatory agency statements adverse information concerning bpa or other chemicals present in our coatings or rulings made within certain federal state provincial and local jurisdictions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations ball recognizes that significant interest exists in nonepoxy based coatings and we have been proactively working with coatings suppliers and our customers to transition to alternative coatings

​ 

earnings and cash flows can be impacted by changes in tax laws 

​ 

as a usbased multinational business the company is subject to income tax in the us and numerous jurisdictions outside the us the relevant tax rules and regulations are complex often changing and in some cases are interdependent if these or other tax rules and regulations should change the company’s earnings and cash flows could be impacted

​ 

in particular the changes proposed by the new us administration including increasing the us corporate income tax rate from 21 percent to 28 percent doubling the rate of tax on certain earnings of nonus subsidiaries and the imposition of a 15 percent minimum tax on worldwide book income could materially affect the company’s financial results if enacted 

​ 

the company’s worldwide provision for income taxes is determined in part through the use of significant estimates and judgments numerous transactions arise in the ordinary course of business where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain the company undergoes tax examinations by various worldwide tax authorities on a regular basis while the company believes its estimates of its tax obligations are reasonable the final outcome after the conclusion of any tax examinations and any litigation could be materially different from what has been reflected in the company’s historical financial statements

​ 

significant developments stemming from the uk’s withdrawal from the eu could have a material adverse effect on us 

​ 

the united kingdom formally withdrew from the european union on january 31 2020 and entered into the euuk trade and cooperation agreement on december 24 2020 our businesses could be affected in a number of ways such as supply chain constraints including delays in importing and exporting products into and out of the uk increased material costs due to rising tariffs effects on employee mobility and increased costs of doing business in the uk 

​ 

the withdrawal of the uk from the eu along with other events that could occur in the future may cause significant volatility in global financial markets including in global currency and debt markets these developments could cause a slowdown in economic activity in the uk europe or globally which could adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects these possible negative impacts and others resulting from the uk’s withdrawal from the eu may adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects

​ 

technological risks 

​ 

decreases in our ability to develop or apply new technology and knowhow may affect our competitiveness 

​ 

our success depends partially on our ability to improve production processes and services we must also introduce new products and services to meet changing customer needs if we are unable to implement better production processes or to develop new products through research and development or licensing of new technology we may not be able to remain competitive with other manufacturers as a result our business financial condition cash flows or results of operations could be adversely affected

increased information technology it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems networks products solutions and services 

​ 

the company’s it systems or any third party’s system on which the company relies could fail on their own accord or may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions or shutdowns including interruptions or shutdowns due to natural disasters power outages or telecommunications failures terrorist attacks or failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software or hardware increased global it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime also pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data as a provider of products and services to government and commercial customers our aerospace business in particular may be the target of cyberattacks including attempts to gain unauthorized access to classified or sensitive information and networks the company has a number of shared service centers where many of the company’s it systems are concentrated and any disruption at such a location could impact the company’s business within the operating zones served by the impacted service center 

​ 

while we attempt to mitigate all of these risks by employing a number of measures including employee training comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems networks products solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats or other it disruptions depending on their nature and scope such threats could potentially lead to the compromise of confidential information improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data defective products harm to individuals or property contractual or regulatory actions and fines penalties and potential liabilities production downtimes and operational disruptions which in turn could adversely affect our reputation competitiveness and results of operations data privacy and protection laws are evolving and present increasing compliance challenges which may increase our costs affect our competitiveness and could expose us to substantial fines or other penalties in addition a security breach that involves classified or other sensitive government information could subject us to civil or criminal penalties and could result in the loss of our secure facility clearance and other accreditation loss of our government contracts loss of access to classified information or debarment as a government contractor

​ 

human capital risks 

​ 

if we fail to retain key management and personnel we may be unable to implement our key objectives 

​ 

we believe our future success depends in part on our experienced management team unforeseen losses of key members of our management team without appropriate succession andor compensation planning could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet our objectives 

​ 

prolonged work stoppages at facilities with union employees could jeopardize our financial position 

​ 

as of december 31 2020 12 percent of our north american employees and 54 percent of our european employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements these collective bargaining agreements have staggered expirations during the next several years although we consider our employee relations to be generally good a prolonged work stoppage or strike at any facility with union employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows or results of operations in addition we cannot ensure that upon the expiration of existing collective bargaining agreements new agreements will be reached without union action or that any such new agreements will be on terms satisfactory to us

​ 

environmental risks 

​ 

adverse weather and climate changes may result in lower sales 

​ 

we manufacture packaging products primarily for beverages unseasonable weather can reduce demand for certain beverages packaged in our containers climate change and the increasing frequency of severe weather events could have various effects on the demand for our products our supply chain and the costs of inputs to our production and delivery of products in different regions around the world our plants’ production may be prevented or curtailed due to severe or unanticipated weather and climate events

​ 

our business is subject to substantial environmental remediation and compliance costs 

​ 

our operations are subject to federal state provincial and local laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions relating to environmental hazards such as emissions to air discharges to water the handling and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes and the cleanup of hazardous substances we have been designated along with numerous other companies as a potentially responsible party for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites additionally there is increased focus on the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental issues worldwide we strive to mitigate such risks related to environmental issues including through the purchase of renewable energy the adoption of sustainable practices and by positioning ourselves as a sustainability leader in our industry

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

management’s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k annual report which include additional information about our accounting policies practices and the transactions underlying our financial results the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes including various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits taxes environmental and other matters arising during the normal course of business we apply our best judgment our knowledge of existing facts and circumstances and actions that we may undertake in the future in determining the estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances such as current economic conditions and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change as future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision actual results may differ from these estimates ball corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as “ball corporation” “ball” “the company” “we” or “our” in the following discussion and analysis 

​ 

overview 

​ 

business overview and industry trends 

​ 

ball corporation is one of the world’s leading aluminum packaging suppliers our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses are manufactured in facilities around the world and are competitive with other substrates such as plastics and glass in the aluminum packaging industry sales and earnings can be increased by reducing costs increasing prices developing new products expanding volumes and making strategic acquisitions we also provide aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers including national defense hardware antenna and video tactical solutions civil and operational space hardware and system engineering services

​ 

we sell our aluminum packaging products mainly to large multinational beverage personal care and household products companies with which we have developed longterm relationships this is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of longterm supply contracts while we have a diversified customer base we sell a significant portion of our packaging products to major companies and brands as well as to numerous regional customers the overall global aluminum beverage and aerosol container industries are growing and are expected to continue to grow in the medium to long term the primary customers for the products and services provided by our aerospace segment are us government agencies or their prime contractors

​ 

we purchase our raw materials from relatively few suppliers we also have exposure to inflation in particular the rising costs of raw materials as well as other direct cost inputs we mitigate our exposure to the changes in the costs of aluminum through the inclusion of provisions in contracts covering the majority of our volumes to pass through aluminum price changes as well as through the use of derivative instruments the passthrough provisions generally result in proportional increases or decreases in sales and costs with a greatly reduced impact if any on net earnings because of our customer and supplier concentration our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss insolvency or bankruptcy of a major customer or supplier or a change in a supply agreement with a major customer or supplier although our contract provisions generally mitigate the risk of customer loss and our longterm relationships represent a known stable customer base

​ 

the majority of our aerospace business involves work under contracts generally from one to five years in duration as a prime contractor or subcontractor for various us government agencies intense competition and long operating cycles are key characteristics of the company’s aerospace and defense industry where it is common for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to a competitor become a subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting company

​ 

corporate strategy 

​ 

our drive for 10 vision encompasses five strategic levers that are key to growing our business and achieving longterm success since launching drive for 10 in 2011 we have made progress on each of the levers as follows

​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

these ongoing business developments help us stay close to our customers while expanding andor sustaining our industry positions and global reach with major beverage personal care household products and aerospace customers in order to successfully execute our strategy and reach our goals we realize the importance of excelling in the following areas customer focus operational excellence innovation and business development people and culture focus and sustainability

​ 

results of operations 

​ 

management’s discussion and analysis for our results of operations on a consolidated and segment basis include a quantification of factors that had a material impact other factors that did not have a material impact but that are significant to understand the results are qualitatively described

​ 

refer to item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the company’s annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2019 filed on february 19 2020 for a comparison of our 2019 results of operations to the 2018 results prior forms 10k have not been restated to reflect changes to ball’s internal reporting structure that were effective january 1 2020

​ 

novel coronavirus covid19 

​ 

the novel coronavirus covid19 had a material effect upon the global business environment during the year ended december 31 2020 ball provides key products and services to the consumer beverage and household markets and the us aerospace markets and consequently the operations of ball and of its principal customers and suppliers have been designated as essential across our key markets this designation allowed ball to operate its manufacturing facilities throughout 2020 and it is expected that ball will continue to operate its facilities without disruption in the foreseeable future however countries around the globe have issued stayathome orders and mandated operational closures of nonessential businesses which has impacted certain of our customers by constraining some supply of products to certain consumers the risks that covid19 continues to present to ball’s business have been outlined in item 1 risk factors and note 1 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report

​ 

consolidated sales and earnings 

​ 

 ​ 

sales in 2020 were 307 million higher compared to 2019 primarily as a result of increased sales volumes in our beverage packaging segments and increased sales in our aerospace segment partially offset by the pass through of lower aluminum prices the sale of the china beverage packaging can business in the third quarter of 2019 and the sale of the argentine steel aerosol business in the fourth quarter of 2019 

​ 

net earnings attributable to ball corporation in 2020 were 19 million higher than 2019 primarily due to higher comparable operating earnings for reportable segments and lower interest expense partially offset by higher business consolidation and debt refinancing costs and a higher effective tax rate 

​ 

cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization 

​ 

cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization was 9323 million in 2020 compared to 9203 million in 2019 these amounts represented 79 percent and 80 percent of consolidated net sales for the years ended 2020 and 2019 respectively 

​ 

depreciation and amortization 

​ 

depreciation and amortization expense was 668 million in 2020 compared to 678 million in 2019 these amounts represented 6 percent of consolidated net sales for the years ended 2020 and 2019 amortization expense in 2020 and 2019 included 150 million and 155 million respectively for the amortization of acquired rexam intangibles

​ 

selling general and administrative 

​ 

selling general and administrative sga expenses were 525 million in 2020 compared to 417 million in 2019 these amounts represented 4 percent of consolidated net sales for both years personnel and other costs increased year over year to support growth investments

​ 

business consolidation costs and other activities 

​ 

business consolidation costs and other activities were 262 million in 2020 compared to 244 million in 2019 these amounts represented 2 percent of consolidated net sales for both years

​ 

interest expense 

​ 

total interest expense was 316 million in 2020 compared to 324 million in 2019 interest expense excluding the effect of debt refinancing and other costs as a percentage of average borrowings decreased by approximately 85 basis points from 44 percent in 2019 to 35 percent in 2020 due to the drop in global interest rates 

​ 

tax provision 

​ 

the company’s effective tax rate is affected by recurring items such as income earned in foreign jurisdictions with tax rates that differ from the us tax rate and by discrete items that may occur in any given year but are not consistent from year to year 

​ 

the 2020 effective income tax rate was 144 percent compared to 117 percent for 2019 as compared with the statutory us federal income tax rate of 21 percent the 2020 effective rate was reduced by 68 percent for equity compensation benefits by 57 percent for the impact of the us rd credit and by 2 percent for various uncertain tax positions these reductions were partially offset by an increase of 34 percent for the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on certain deferred tax assets while these items are expected to recur the potential magnitude of each item is uncertain 

​ 

the 2020 effective income tax rate was also increased by 26 percent for enacted changes to tax rates in the uk and by 23 percent for the impact of nondeductible goodwill these items are not expected to recur 

​ 

further details of taxes on income are included in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report

​ 

results of business segments 

​ 

segment results 

​ 

ball’s operations are organized and reviewed by management along its product lines and geographical areas and its operating results are presented in the four reportable segments discussed below effective january 1 2020 ball implemented changes to its management and internal reporting structure for cost reduction and operational efficiency purposes as a result of these changes the company’s plants in cairo egypt and manisa turkey are now included in the beverage packaging europe middle east and africa beverage packaging emea segment in addition the company’s operations in india and saudi arabia are now combined with the former nonreportable beverage packaging asia pacific operating segment as a new nonreportable beverage packaging other operating segment the company’s segment results and disclosures for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 have been retrospectively adjusted to conform to the current year presentation

​ 

beverage packaging north and central america 

​ 

 

 ​ 

segment sales in 2020 were 318 million higher compared to 2019 the increase in 2020 was primarily due to higher volumes higher specialty mix and improved customer contractual terms partially offset by lower aluminum prices we cannot predict the impact on sales that will result from future changes in aluminum input prices 

​ 

comparable operating earnings in 2020 were 128 million higher compared to 2019 primarily due to higher sales volumes higher specialty mix benefits from improved customer contractual terms and improved operating performance partially offset by increased capacity expansion and labor costs

​ 

beverage packaging emea 

​ 

 

 ​ 

segment sales in 2020 were 88 million higher compared to 2019 the increase in 2020 was primarily due to higher sales volumes and improved customer and specialty mix partially offset by the pass through of lower aluminum prices 

​ 

comparable operating earnings in 2020 were 3 million higher compared to 2019 primarily due to higher sales volumes and improved customer and specialty mix partially offset by higher labor and warehousing costs and intermittent production line downtime during the second quarter of 2020 

​ 

​ 

beverage packaging south america 

​ 

 

 ​ 

segment sales in 2020 were 25 million higher compared to 2019 the increase in 2020 was primarily related to higher volumes partially offset by regional pricing and the pass through of lower aluminum prices

​ 

comparable operating earnings in 2020 were 8 million lower compared to 2019 primarily related to adverse cost absorption due to intermittent production line downtime in the second quarter of 2020 and regional pricing partially offset by increased sales volumes 

​ 

aerospace 

​ 

 ​ 

segment sales in 2020 were 262 million higher compared to 2019 and comparable operating earnings were 13 million higher the increase in sales and operating earnings for 2020 was primarily the result of increases from significant us national defense contracts

​ 

sales to the us government either directly as a prime contractor or indirectly as a subcontractor represented 97 percent of segment sales in 2020 compared to 98 percent of segment sales in 2019 the aerospace contract mix in 2020 consisted of 49 percent costtype contracts which are billed at our costs plus an agreedupon andor earned profit component and 48 percent fixedprice contracts the remaining sales were for time and materials contracts

​ 

contracted backlog for the aerospace segment at december 31 2020 and 2019 was 24 billion and 25 billion respectively the segment has numerous outstanding bids for future contract awards the backlog at december 31 2020 consisted of 42 percent costtype contracts comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations due to the nature of varying delivery and milestone schedules on contracts funding of programs and the uncertainty of timing of future contract awards

​ 

management performance measures 

​ 

management internally uses various measures to evaluate company performance including comparable operating earnings earnings before interest taxes and business consolidation and other noncomparable costs comparable net earnings earnings before business consolidation costs and other noncomparable costs after tax comparable diluted earnings per share comparable net earnings divided by diluted weighted average shares outstanding return on average invested capital net operating earnings after tax over the relevant performance period divided by average invested capital over the same period economic value added eva® dollars net operating earnings after tax less a capital charge on average invested capital employed earnings before interest and taxes ebit earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda and diluted earnings per share in addition management uses free cash flow generally defined by the company as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures as a measure to evaluate the company’s liquidity we believe this information is also useful to investors as it provides insight into the earnings and cash flow criteria that management uses to make strategic decisions these financial measures may be adjusted at times for items that affect comparability between periods such as business consolidation costs and gains or losses on acquisitions and dispositions

​ 

nonfinancial measures in the packaging businesses include production efficiency and spoilage rates quality control figures environmental health and safety statistics production and sales volumes asset utilization rates and measures of sustainability additional measures used to evaluate financial performance in the aerospace segment include contract revenue realization award and incentive fees realized proposal win rates and backlog including awarded contracted and funded backlog

​ 

many of the above noted financial measurements are presented on a nonus gaap basis and should be considered in connection with the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report nonus gaap measures should not be considered in isolation nor should they not be considered superior to or a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with us gaap a presentation of earnings in accordance with us gaap is available in item 8 of this annual report

​ 

based on the above definitions our calculations of comparable operating earnings comparable net earnings comparable diluted earnings per share and free cash flow are summarized as follows

​

 ​ 

critical and significant accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements 

​ 

for information regarding the company’s critical and significant accounting policies as well as recent accounting pronouncements see notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report

​ 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

​ 

cash flows and capital expenditures 

​ 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities and external borrowings we believe that cash flows from operating activities and cash provided by shortterm longterm and committed revolver borrowings when necessary will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements scheduled principal and interest payments on debt dividend payments anticipated share repurchases and anticipated capital expenditures we have no debt maturities until 2022 our senior credit facilities are in place until 2024 and we are focused in the near term on maintaining liquidity and flexibility in the current economic environment the following table summarizes our cash flows

​ 

 ​ 

cash flows provided by operating activities were 116 million lower in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to higher working capital outflows of 106 million in 2020 compared to inflows of 236 million in 2019 partially offset by lower pension contributions the higher working capital outflows in 2020 resulted from seasonal working capital build which was more sizeable than typical due largely to the timing of aluminum payments in the first quarter increased personnel costs to support growth and a proportionally larger increase in days sales outstanding as compared to days payable outstanding in comparison to the same period of 2019 our working capital movements reflect an increase of days sales outstanding from 38 days in 2019 to 42 days in 2020 and an increase of inventory days on hand from 48 days in 2019 to 50 days in 2020 partially offset by an increase of days payable outstanding from 118 days in 2019 to 128 days in 2020

​ 

cash outflows from investing activities increased by 759 million from 422 million in 2019 to 1181 million in 2020 this predominantly reflected a 515 million increase in capital expenditures for large growth projects a 160 million inflow from the 2019 sale of the steel food and steel aerosol business and a 69 million outflow for the 2020 acquisition of the brazil aluminum aerosol packaging business

​ 

cash outflows from financing activities increased by 556 million from 46 million in 2019 to 602 million in 2020 primarily related to total debt activity changing from net borrowings of 11 billion in 2019 to net repayments of 262 million in 2020 partially offset by a reduction in net share repurchases from 945 million in 2019 to 75 million in 2020

​ 

we have entered into several regional committed and uncommitted accounts receivable factoring programs with various financial institutions for certain of our accounts receivable programs accounted for as true sales of the receivables without recourse to ball had combined limits of approximately 16 billion and 14 billion at december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 respectively a total of 232 million and 230 million were available for sale under these programs at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

​ 

as of december 31 2020 approximately 684 million of our cash was held outside of the us in the event we need to utilize any of the cash held outside of the us for purposes within the us there are no material legal or other economic restrictions regarding the repatriation of cash from any of the countries outside the us where we have cash the company believes its us operating cash flows cash on hand as well as availability under its longterm revolving credit facilities uncommitted shortterm credit facilities and committed and uncommitted accounts receivable factoring programs will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of the us portion of our ongoing operations scheduled principal and interest payments on us debt dividend payments capital expenditures and other us cash requirements if foreign funds are needed for our us cash requirements and we are unable to provide the funds through intercompany financing arrangements we would be required to repatriate funds from foreign locations where the company has previously asserted indefinite reinvestment of funds outside the us 

​ 

based on its indefinite reinvestment assertion the company has not provided deferred taxes on earnings in certain nonus subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in its international operations it is not practical to estimate the additional taxes that might become payable if these earnings were remitted to the us

​ 

share repurchases 

​ 

the company’s share repurchases net of issuances totaled 75 million in 2020 and 945 million in 2019 the repurchases were completed using cash on hand cash provided by operating activities proceeds from the sale of businesses and available borrowings 

​ 

debt facilities and refinancing 

​ 

given our cash flow projections and unused credit facilities that are available until march 2024 our liquidity is strong and is expected to meet our ongoing cash and debt service requirements total interestbearing debt was 78 billion at both december 31 2020 and 2019

​ 

in the third quarter of 2020 ball issued 13 billion of 2875 senior notes due in 2030 in the first quarter of 2020 ball redeemed the outstanding eurodenominated 350 senior notes due in 2020 in the amount of €400 million and the outstanding 4375 senior notes due 2020 in the amount of 1 billion we recorded debt refinancing and other costs of 41 million in 2020

​

​ 

at december 31 2020 taking into account outstanding letters of credit approximately 17 billion was available under the company’s longterm multicurrency committed revolving credit facilities which are available until march 2024 in addition to these facilities the company had 1 billion of shortterm uncommitted credit facilities available at december 31 2020 of which 14 million was outstanding and due on demand 

​ 

while ongoing financial and economic conditions in certain areas may raise concerns about credit risk with counterparties to derivative transactions the company mitigates its exposure by allocating the risk among various counterparties and limiting exposure to any one party we also monitor the credit ratings of our suppliers customers lenders and counterparties on a regular basis

​ 

we were in compliance with all loan agreements at december 31 2020 and for all prior years presented and we have met all debt payment obligations the us note agreements and bank credit agreement contain certain restrictions relating to dividends investments financial ratios guarantees and the incurrence of additional indebtedness in august 2020 we amended certain of our credit agreements which among other things modified the most restrictive of our debt covenants this covenant requires us to maintain a leverage ratio as defined of no greater than 50 times which will change to 45 times as of december 31 2022 as of december 31 2020 the company could borrow up to its limits available under the company’s longterm multicurrency committed revolving facilities and shortterm uncommitted credit facilities without violating our existing debt covenants additional details about our debt are available in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report

​ 

other liquidity measures 

​ 

free cash flow 

​ 

management internally uses a free cash flow measure to 1 evaluate the company’s liquidity 2 evaluate strategic investments 3 plan share repurchase and dividend levels and 4 evaluate the company’s ability to incur and service debt free cash flow is not a defined term under us gaap and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures the company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures free cash flow is typically derived directly from the company’s consolidated statement of cash flows however it may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods

​ 

based on the above definition our consolidated free cash flow is summarized as follows

​ 

 ​ 

based on information currently available we estimate that cash flows from operating activities for 2021 will exceed 2020 levels and capital expenditures will exceed 15 billion in 2021 we intend to utilize our operating cash flow to fund our growth capital projects dividend payments share repurchases debt service requirements and to the extent available acquisitions that meet our rate of return criteria approximately 11 billion of capital expenditures was contractually committed as of december 31 2020

​ 

commitments 

​ 

cash payments required for longterm debt maturities and interest payments rental payments under noncancellable operating leases and purchase obligations in effect at december 31 2020 are summarized in the following table 

​ 

 

 ​ 

the table above excludes 55 million of uncertain tax positions as the ultimate timing of resolution for these matters is unknown at this time 

​ 

also excluded from the table above are contributions to the company’s defined benefit pension plans which are expected to be approximately 185 million in 2021 of which 157 million was paid in january 2021 this estimate may change based on changes in the pension protection act actual plan asset performance and available company cash flow among other factors benefit payments related to the plans are expected to be approximately 337 million 336 million 339 million 344 million and 347 million for the years ending december 31 2021 through 2025 respectively and approximately 18 billion for the years ending december 31 2026 through 2030 

​ 

based on changes in return on asset and discount rate assumptions as well as revisions based on plan experience studies total pension expense in 2021 is expected to be approximately 4 million higher than in 2020 excluding settlement charges a reduction of the expected return on pension assets assumption by one quarter of a percentage point would result in an increase of approximately 14 million in total 2021 pension expense while a quarter of a percentage point reduction in the discount rate applied to the pension liability would result in a negligible increase to pension expense in 2021 additional details about our defined benefit pension plans are available in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

​ 

financial instruments and risk management 

​ 

the company employs established risk management policies and procedures which seek to reduce the company’s commercial risk exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices interest rates currency exchange rates and prices of the company’s common stock with regard to common share repurchases and the company’s deferred compensation stock plan however there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be successful although the instruments utilized involve varying degrees of credit market and interest risk the counterparties to the agreements are expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements the company monitors counterparty credit risk including lenders on a regular basis but ball cannot be certain that all risks will be discerned or that its risk management policies and procedures will always be effective additionally in the event of default under the company’s master derivative agreements the nondefaulting party has the option to set off any amounts owed with regard to open derivative positions 

​ 

we have estimated our market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis market risk exposure has been defined as the changes in fair value of derivative instruments financial instruments and commodity positions to test the sensitivity of our market risk exposure we have estimated the changes in fair value of market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in market prices or rates the results of the sensitivity analyses are summarized below

commodity price risk 

​ 

aluminum 

​ 

we manage commodity price risk in connection with market price fluctuations of aluminum ingot through two different methods first we enter into container sales contracts that include aluminum ingotbased pricing terms that generally reflect the same price fluctuations included in commercial purchase contracts for aluminum sheet the terms include fixed floating or passthrough aluminum ingot component pricing second we use derivative instruments such as option and forward contracts as economic and cash flow hedges of commodity price risk where there are material differences between sales and purchase contracted pricing and volume

​ 

considering the effects of derivative instruments the company’s ability to pass through certain raw material costs through contractual provisions the market’s ability to accept price increases and the company’s commodity price exposures under its contract terms a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the company’s aluminum prices would result in an estimated 4 million aftertax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period additionally the company has currency exposures on raw materials and the effect of a 10 percent adverse change is included in the total currency exposure discussed below actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates

​ 

interest rate risk 

​ 

our objective in managing exposure to interest rate changes is to minimize the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to minimize our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we may use a variety of interest rate swaps collars and options to manage our mix of floating and fixedrate debt interest rate instruments held by the company at december 31 2020 included payfixed interest rate swaps which effectively convert variable rate obligations to fixedrate instruments

​ 

based on our interest rate exposure at december 31 2020 assumed floating rate debt levels throughout the next 12 months and the effects of our existing derivative instruments a 100basis point increase in interest rates would result in an estimated 2 million aftertax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates and the timing of these changes

​ 

currency exchange rate risk 

​ 

our objective in managing exposure to currency fluctuations is to limit the exposure of cash flows and earnings from changes associated with currency exchange rate changes through the use of various derivative contracts in addition at times ball manages earnings translation volatility through the use of currency option strategies and the change in the fair value of those options is recorded in the company’s net earnings our currency translation risk results from the currencies in which we transact business the company faces currency exposures in our global operations as a result of various factors including intercompany currency denominated loans selling our products in various currencies purchasing raw materials and equipment in various currencies and tax exposures not denominated in the functional currency sales contracts are negotiated with customers to reflect cost changes and where there is not an exchange passthrough arrangement the company may use forward and option contracts to manage significant currency exposures

​ 

considering the company’s derivative financial instruments outstanding at december 31 2020 and the various currency exposures a hypothetical 10 percent reduction us dollar strengthening mainly against the russian ruble in currency exchange rates compared to the us dollar would result in an estimated 12 million aftertax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period this hypothetical adverse change in currency exchange rates would also reduce our forecasted average debt balance by 256 million actual changes in market prices or rates may differ from hypothetical changes

​ 

sustainability 

​ 

at ball corporation we believe in our people our culture and our ability to deliver value to our stakeholders like uncompromising integrity and customer focus sustainability is part of our drive for 10 vision and has been a part of who we are since our founding in 1880 

​ 

our triple bottomline approach to sustainability – environmental economic and social – has evolved over the years and is the lens through which we conduct business at every level of our organization today sustainability is a key part of our business strategy and influences how we manage and operate our businesses serve our customers care for the environment and our communities secure profits and drive longterm prosperity 

​ 

we focus our sustainability efforts on product stewardship operational excellence human capital management and community engagement in our manufacturing operations around the world we work on continuous improvement of employee safety and engagement energy and water efficiency reducing air emissions and waste reduction and recycling and our commitment extends outside of our walls

​ 

today’s consumers are acutely aware of the plastic pollution crisis and they are choosing brands based on their sustainability customers understand this growing concern for the environment and their unique position in impacting the environment for better or worse especially through the packaging materials they use infinitely recyclable and economically valuable aluminum unlocks the full potential of packaging to help customers convey values and purpose to consumers

​ 

aluminum cans bottles and now cups are an increasingly attractive option for sustainabilityconscious brands and consumers who want to do the right thing for the environment unlike plastic glass cartons or compostable containers aluminum can be recycled again and again without losing quality and is in high demand across industries and applications pushing its collection sorting and recycling rates to the highest of any material that’s why 75 percent of all aluminum ever produced is still in use today 

​ 

in 2017 resource recycling systems recognized aluminum beverage cans as the most recycled beverage package in the world with a global average recycling rate of 69 percent in comparison only 43 percent of pet and 46 percent of glass bottles were collected although not necessarily recycled these findings solidify aluminum beverage packaging as the leader in real recycling where the package is collected and then transformed into an item of equal value producttoproduct or materialtomaterial recycling in the case of aluminum beverage packaging which is monomaterial a can bottle or cup can be recycled and made back into the same product in as little as 60 days in contrast only nine percent of all plastic ever produced has been recycled and mostly it’s only downcycled downcycled products including but not limited to when plastic is converted to become part of a sneaker or fibers in a carpet is not sustainable because eventually those products end up in landfills real recycling happens when the value of the product being recycled is maintained from one use to another 

​ 

because recycling aluminum saves resources and uses significantly less energy than primary aluminum production we are innovating and collaborate with our customers supply chain and other public and private partners to establish and financially support initiatives to increase recycling rates as two examples we work together to create effective collection and recycling systems and educate consumers about the sustainability benefits of aluminum packaging 

​ 

our aerospace business plays a role in sustainability as well more and more our systems are measuring key elements of the physical environment and supporting environmental monitoring and operational weather forecasting programs as well as providing environmental intelligence on weather the earths climate system precipitation drought air pollution vegetation and biodiversity measurements 

the data captured through ballbuilt instruments and satellites enable an enhanced understanding of the earth’s ecosystem and the stratospheric ozone layer and severe storm tracking and better enabling effective management of natural resources including helping experts to make routine drought assessments and fire prevention plans

​ 

at ball our sustained longterm success depends not only on our products and our operations but on an engaged and sustainable workforce we continue to invest in recruiting to ensure we have the right people with the right skills in the right roles and in developing our employees at every level and providing them with opportunities to advance their careers we also are committed to embracing diversity and providing an inclusive environment where employees can thrive a focus on diversity among individuals and teams helps to unleash ideas and fuel innovation which drives growth and economic value throughout our global organization

​ 

a healthy and sustainable business also depends on thriving communities ball’s commitment to the communities where we live and operate is an integral part of our corporate culture as we continue to support organizations programs and civic initiatives that advance sustainable livelihoods community engagement is how our company and our employees enrich the places where we live and work beyond providing jobs benefits and paying local taxes through the ball foundation corporate giving employee giving and volunteerism we invest in the future of the communities that sustain us in 2018 ball and its employees donated nearly 55 million and logged more than 42000 hours of volunteer service to nonprofit organizations centered on building sustainable communities through recycling stem education and disaster preparedness and relief initiatives

​ 

our reportable segments 

​ 

ball corporation reports its financial performance in four reportable segments 1 beverage packaging north and central america 2 beverage packaging south america 3 beverage packaging europe and 4 aerospace ball also has investments in the us guatemala panama south korea and vietnam that are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and accordingly those results are not included in segment sales or earnings financial information related to each of our segments is included in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report on form 10k annual report

​ 

beginning in january 2020 ball has changed how the beverage packaging amea and beverage packaging asia pacific operating segments are being managed and reported for the purposes of cost reduction and operational efficiency the company’s plants in cairo egypt and manisa turkey will be managed with the existing reportable beverage packaging europe operating segment the company’s operations in india and saudi arabia will be consolidated with the remainder of the beverage packaging asia pacific operating segment resulting in a new nonreportable beverage packaging other operating segment these changes will be reflected in our segment financial reporting beginning in the first quarter of 2020 including comparative historical periods

​ 

beverage packaging north and central america segment 

​ 

beverage packaging north and central america is ball’s largest segment accounting for 41 percent of consolidated net sales in 2019 aluminum beverage containers are primarily sold under multiyear supply contracts to fillers of carbonated soft drinks beer energy drinks and other beverages

​ 

aluminum beverage containers and ends are produced at 17 manufacturing facilities in the us one in canada and two in mexico the beverage packaging north and central america segment also includes interests in three joint ventures that are accounted for using the equity method 

​ 

the north american beverage container manufacturing industry is relatively mature since 2018 the industry has begun to see certain new products launched in aluminum cans at an increased rate than had been historically as well as further can penetration in existing beverage categories in order to serve growing customer demand for specialty cans across north america the company constructed a fourline beverage packaging facility in goodyear arizona which began production in the second quarter of 2018 and recently announced plans to construct additional plants in glendale arizona and an unspecified location in the northeastern us

​ 

according to publicly available information and company estimates the north american beverage container industry represents approximately 115 billion units five companies manufacture substantially all of the metal beverage containers in the us canada and mexico ball shipped approximately 48 billion infinitely recyclable aluminum beverage containers in north america in 2019 which represented approximately 42 percent of the aggregate production in these countries historically sales volumes of metal beverage containers in north america tend to be highest during the period from april through september all of the beverage containers produced by ball in the us canada and mexico are made of aluminum in north and central america a diverse base of no less than 10 global suppliers provide almost all of our aluminum can and end sheet requirements  

​ 

beverage containers are sold based on price quality service innovation and sustainability in a highly competitive market which is relatively capital intensive and characterized by facilities that run more or less continuously in order to operate profitably in addition the aluminum beverage container competes aggressively with other packaging materials which include meaningful industry positions by the glass bottle in the packaged beer industry and the polyethylene terephthalate pet bottle in the carbonated soft drink and water industries

​ 

we limit our exposure to changes in the cost of aluminum ingot as a result of the inclusion of provisions in most of our aluminum beverage container sales contracts to pass through aluminum price changes as well as through the use of derivative instruments

​ 

our beverage can manufacturing facility in birmingham alabama ceased production during the second quarter of 2018 and the chatsworth california and longview texas facilities ceased production during the third quarter of 2018 these facilities produced aluminum beverage cans and ends in a variety of sizes and their customers are now supplied by the company’s other us facilities 

​ 

beverage packaging south america segment 

​ 

the beverage packaging south america segment accounted for 15 percent of ball’s consolidated net sales in 2019 our operations consist of 12 facilities 9 in brazil and one each in argentina chile and paraguay for the countries where we operate the south american beverage container market is approximately 36 billion containers and we are the largest producer in this region with an estimated 49 percent of south american shipments in 2019 four companies currently manufacture substantially all of the metal beverage containers in brazil 

​ 

the company’s south american beverage facilities shipped approximately 18 billion aluminum beverage containers in 2019 historically sales volumes of beverage containers in south america tend to be highest during the period from september through december in south america two suppliers provide virtually all our aluminum sheet requirements with certain requirements also being imported from asia

​ 

in order to support contracted volumes for aluminum beverage packaging across paraguay argentina and bolivia the company constructed a oneline beverage can and end manufacturing facility in paraguay which began production in the fourth quarter of 2019 and increased capacity to its buenos aires argentina and santiago chile facilities the company ceased operations at its cuiabá brazil beverage packaging facility in july 2018 and has relocated equipment from the cuiabá facility to other existing facilities in south america

​ 

we limit our exposure to changes in the cost of aluminum ingot as a result of the inclusion of provisions in most of our aluminum beverage container sales contracts to pass through aluminum ingot price changes as well as through the use of derivative instruments

the beverage packaging europe segment accounted for 23 percent of ball’s consolidated net sales in 2019 our european operations consist of 20 facilities throughout europe the european beverage container market is approximately 72 billion containers including russia and excluding turkey and we are the largest producer with an estimated 42 percent of european shipments the european market is highly regional in terms of sales growth rates and packaging mix four companies manufacture substantially all of the metal beverage containers in europe our european beverage facilities shipped 31 billion beverage containers in 2019 the vast majority of which were produced from aluminum 

​ 

historically sales volumes of metal beverage containers in europe tend to be highest during the period from may through august with a smaller increase in demand leading up to the winter holiday season in the uk offset by much lower demand in russia much like other parts of the world the metal beverage container competes aggressively with other packaging materials used by the european beer and carbonated soft drink industries the glass bottle is heavily utilized in the packaged beer industry while the pet container is utilized in the carbonated soft drink beer juice and water industries these trends are evolving however as customers respond to consumer demand and regulators and nongovernmental organizations press for more sustainable packaging in the wake of the plastic pollution crisis more and more brands are choosing aluminum beverage packaging because of its infinite recyclability and other sustainability credentials the overall recycling rate for aluminum beverage cans in the european union switzerland norway and iceland increased to a new record level of approximately 75 percent in 2017

​ 

european raw material supply contracts generally have longer term agreements in europe five aluminum suppliers and two steel suppliers provide almost all of our requirements aluminum is traded primarily in us dollars while the functional currencies of our european operations are various other currencies the company minimizes its exchange rate risk using derivative and supply contracts in local currencies purchase and sales contracts generally include fixedprice floating or passthrough aluminum ingot component pricing arrangements

​ 

in order to support growth for beverage cans in the iberian peninsula the company constructed in 2018 a twoline aluminum beverage can manufacturing facility near madrid spain with a majority of the facility’s capacity secured under a longterm customer contract the facility is fully operational and produces multiple can sizes utilizing both lines in december 2018 we closed a oneline beverage packaging facility located in san martino italy 

​ 

aerospace segment 

​ 

ball’s aerospace segment which accounted for 13 percent of consolidated net sales in 2019 includes national defense hardware antenna and video tactical solutions civil and operational space hardware and systems engineering services the segment develops spacecraft sensors and instruments radio frequency systems and other advanced technologies for the civil commercial and national security aerospace markets the majority of the aerospace business involves work under contracts generally from one to five years in duration as a prime contractor or subcontractor for the us department of defense dod the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and other us government agencies the company competes against both large and small prime contractors and subcontractors for these contracts contracts funded by the various agencies of the federal government represented 98 percent of segment sales in 2019

​ 

intense competition and long operating cycles are key characteristics of both the company’s business and the aerospace and defense industry it is common in the aerospace and defense industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to a competitor become a subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting company it is not unusual to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or a customer of that same competitor on other contracts or vice versa

​ 

geopolitical events and shifting executive and legislative branch priorities have resulted in an increase in opportunities over the past decade in areas matching our aerospace segment’s core capabilities in space hardware the businesses include hardware and services sold primarily to us customers with emphasis on space science and exploration climate monitoring weather prediction environmental and earth sciences and defense and intelligence applications major activities frequently involve the design manufacture and testing of satellites remote sensors and ground station control hardware and software as well as related services such as launch vehicle integration and satellite operations 

​ 

other hardware activities include target identification warning and attitude control systems and components cryogenic systems for reactant storage and associated sensor cooling devices star trackers which are generalpurpose stellar attitude sensors and faststeering mirrors 

​ 

contracted backlog in the aerospace segment was 25 billion and 22 billion at december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively and consisted of the aggregate contract value of firm orders excluding amounts previously recognized as revenue the 2019 contracted backlog includes 15 billion expected to be recognized in revenues during 2020 with the remainder expected to be recognized in revenues in the years thereafter unfunded amounts included in backlog for certain firm government orders which are subject to annual funding were 16 billion and 14 billion at december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively yearoveryear comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations revenues and earnings due to the nature of varying delivery and milestone schedules on contracts funding of programs and the uncertainty of timing of future contract awards uncertainties in the federal government budgeting process could delay the funding or even result in cancellation of certain programs currently in our reported backlog

 item 1a risk factors 

​ 

any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

​ 

if we do not effectively manage change and growth our business could be adversely affected 

​ 

our future revenue and operating results will depend on our ability to effectively manage the anticipated growth of our business we have experienced significant growth in recent years and are expanding our operations increasing our headcount and expanding into new product offerings this growth has placed significant demands on our management as well as our financial and operational resources and continued growth presents several challenges including

 ​ 

we have a significant level of debt that could have important consequences for our business and any investment in our securities 

​ 

the company had 78 billion of interestbearing debt at december 31 2019 such indebtedness could have significant consequences for our business and any investment in our securities including

​ 

 ​ 

our business operating results and financial condition are subject to particular risks in certain regions of the world 

​ 

we may experience an operating loss in one or more regions of the world for one or more periods which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition moreover overcapacity which often leads to lower prices exists in certain regions in which we operate and may persist even if demand grows more generally supply and demand fluctuations could make it difficult for us to forecast and meet certain customers’ needs our ability to manage such operational fluctuations and to maintain adequate longterm strategies in the face of such developments will be critical to our continued growth and profitability

​ 

the loss of a key customer or a reduction in its requirements could have a significant negative impact on our sales 

​ 

we sell a majority of our packaging products to a relatively limited number of major beverage personal care and household product companies some of which operate in multiple geographical markets we serve

​ 

although the majority of our customer contracts are longterm these contracts unless they are renewed expire in accordance with their respective terms and are terminable under certain circumstances such as our failure to meet quality volume or market pricing requirements because we depend on a relatively limited number of major customers our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss of any of these customers a reduction in the purchasing levels of these customers a strike or work stoppage by a significant number of these customers’ employees or an adverse change in the terms of the supply agreements with these customers

​ 

the primary customers for our aerospace segment are us government agencies or their prime contractors our contracts with these customers are subject to several risks including funding cuts and delays technical uncertainties budget changes government shutdowns competitive activity and changes in scope

​ 

we face competitive risks from many sources that may negatively impact our profitability 

​ 

competition within the packaging and aerospace industries is intense increases in productivity combined with existing or potential surplus capacity in the industry have maintained competitive pricing pressures the principal methods of competition in the general packaging industry are price innovation sustainability service and quality in the aerospace industry they are technical capability cost and schedule some of our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources and some may currently have excess capacity our current or potential competitors may offer products at a lower price or products that are deemed superior to ours the global economic environment has resulted in reductions in demand for our products in some instances which in turn could increase these competitive pressures

​ 

we are subject to competition from alternative products which could result in lower profits and reduced cash flows 

​ 

our metal packaging products are subject to significant competition from substitute products particularly plastic carbonated soft drink bottles made from pet single serve beer bottles and other beverage containers made of glass cardboard or other materials competition from plastic carbonated soft drink bottles is particularly intense in the us and europe certain of our aerospace products are also subject to competition from alternative products and solutions there can be no assurance that our products will successfully compete against alternative products which could result in a reduction in our profits or cash flow

​ 

our packaging businesses have a narrow product range and our business would suffer if usage of our products decreased or if decreases occur in the demand for the beverages and other goods filled in our products 

​ 

the majority of our consolidated net sales were from the sale of beverage containers and we expect to derive a significant portion of our future revenues and cash flows from the sale of beverage containers our business would suffer if the use of beverage containers decreased accordingly broad acceptance by consumers of aluminum containers for a wide variety of beverages is critical to our future success if demand for glass and pet bottles increases relative to metal containers or the demand for aluminum containers does not develop as expected our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected

​ 

changes in laws and governmental regulations may adversely affect our business and operations 

​ 

we and our customers and suppliers are subject to various federal state provincial and local laws and regulations which have been increasing in number and complexity each of our and their facilities is subject to federal state provincial and local licensing and regulation by health environmental workplace safety and other agencies in multiple jurisdictions requirements of worldwide governmental authorities with respect to manufacturing manufacturing facility locations within the jurisdiction product content and safety climate change workplace safety and health environmental expropriation of assets and other standards could adversely affect our ability to manufacture or sell our products and the ability of our customers and suppliers to manufacture and sell their products in addition we face risks arising from compliance with and enforcement of numerous and complex federal state provincial and local laws and regulations

​ 

enacted regulatory developments regarding the reporting and use of “conflict minerals” mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries could affect the sourcing availability and price of minerals used in the manufacture of certain of our products as a result there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflictfree materials and we cannot give assurance that we will be able to obtain such products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices also because our supply chains are complex we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of all materials used in the products that we sell the compliance and reporting aspects of these regulations may result in incremental costs to the company while deposit systems and other containerrelated legislation have been adopted in some jurisdictions similar legislation has been defeated in public referenda and legislative bodies in many others we anticipate that continuing efforts will be made to consider and adopt such legislation in the future the packages we produce are widely used and perform well in us states canadian provinces and european countries that have deposit systems as well as in other countries worldwide

​ 

significant environmental employmentrelated and other legislation and regulatory requirements exist and are also evolving the compliance costs associated with current and proposed laws and potential regulations could be substantial and any failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws or regulations could lead to litigation or governmental action all of which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations

​ 

our business financial condition and results of operations are subject to risks resulting from broader geographic operations 

​ 

we derived approximately 50 percent of our consolidated net sales from outside of the us for the year ended december 31 2019 the sizeable scope of operations outside of the us may lead to more volatile financial results and make it more difficult for us to manage our business reasons for this include but are not limited to the following

​ 

 ​ 

we are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations 

​ 

the financial results of the company are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations and a significant proportion of assets liabilities and earnings denominated in nonus dollar currencies the company presents its financial statements in us dollars and has a significant proportion of its net assets debt and income in nonus dollar currencies primarily the euro as well as the russian ruble and other emerging market currencies the company’s financial results and capital ratios are therefore sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates 

​ 

we manage our exposure to currency fluctuations particularly our exposure to fluctuations in the euro to us dollar exchange rate to attempt to mitigate the effect of cash flow and earnings volatility associated with exchange rate changes we primarily use forward contracts and options to manage our currency exposures and as a result we experience gains and losses on these derivative positions offset in part by the impact of currency fluctuations on existing assets and liabilities 

​ 

if we fail to retain key management and personnel we may be unable to implement our key objectives 

​ 

we believe our future success depends in part on our experienced management team unforeseen losses of key members of our management team without appropriate succession andor compensation planning could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet our objectives 

​ 

decreases in our ability to develop or apply new technology and knowhow may affect our competitiveness 

​ 

our success depends partially on our ability to improve production processes and services we must also introduce new products and services to meet changing customer needs if we are unable to implement better production processes or to develop new products through research and development or licensing of new technology we may not be able to remain competitive with other manufacturers as a result our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected

​ 

adverse weather and climate changes may result in lower sales 

​ 

we manufacture packaging products primarily for beverages unseasonable weather can reduce demand for certain beverages packaged in our containers climate change and the increasing frequency of severe weather events could have various effects on the demand for our products our supply chain and the costs of inputs to our production and delivery of products in different regions around the world

​ 

we are vulnerable to fluctuations in the supply and price of raw materials 

​ 

we purchase aluminum and other raw materials and packaging supplies from several sources while all such materials are available from independent suppliers raw materials are subject to fluctuations in price and availability attributable to a number of factors including general economic conditions commodity price fluctuations particularly aluminum on the london metal exchange the demand by other industries for the same raw materials and the availability of complementary and substitute materials although we enter into commodities purchase agreements from time to time and sometimes use derivative instruments to seek to manage our risk we cannot ensure that our current suppliers of raw materials will be able to supply us with sufficient quantities at reasonable prices economic operational and financial factors as well as governmental action could impact our suppliers thereby causing supply shortages increases in raw material costs including potential increases due to tariffs sanctions or other trade actions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in the americas europe and asia some contracts do not allow us to pass along increased raw material costs and we generally use derivative agreements to seek to manage this risk our hedging procedures may be insufficient and our results could be materially impacted if costs of materials increase due to the fixedprice contracts and derivative activities while increasing raw material costs may not impact our nearterm profitability increased prices could decrease our sales volume over time

​ 

prolonged work stoppages at facilities with union employees could jeopardize our financial position 

​ 

as of december 31 2019 15 percent of our north american employees and 53 percent of our european employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements these collective bargaining agreements have staggered expirations during the next several years although we consider our employee relations to be generally good a prolonged work stoppage or strike at any facility with union employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition we cannot ensure that upon the expiration of existing collective bargaining agreements new agreements will be reached without union action or that any such new agreements will be on terms satisfactory to us

​ 

our aerospace segment is subject to certain risks specific to that business 

​ 

in our aerospace business us government contracts are subject to reduction or modification in the event of changes in requirements and the government may also terminate contracts at its convenience pursuant to standard termination provisions in such instances ball may be entitled to reimbursement for allowable costs and profits on authorized work that has been performed through the date of termination

​ 

in addition budgetary constraints and government shutdowns may result in further reductions to projected spending levels by the us government in particular government expenditures are subject to the potential for automatic reductions generally referred to as “sequestration” sequestration may occur in any given year resulting in significant additional reductions to spending by various us government defense and aerospace agencies on both existing and new contracts as well as the disruption of ongoing programs even if sequestration does not occur we expect that budgetary constraints and ongoing concerns regarding the us national debt will continue to place downward pressure on agency spending levels due to these and other factors overall spending on various programs could decline which could result in significant reductions to revenue cash flows net earnings and backlog primarily in our aerospace segment

​ 

we use estimates in accounting for many of our programs in our aerospace business and changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results 

​ 

we account for sales and profits on a portion of longterm contracts in our aerospace business in accordance with the percentageofcompletion method of accounting using the costtocost method to account for updates in estimates the percentageofcompletion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project revenues and costs at completion and various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events including the quantity and timing of product deliveries future labor performance and rates and material and overhead costs these assumptions involve various levels of expected performance improvements under the costtocost method the impact of updates in our estimates related to units shipped to date or progress made to date is recognized immediately

​ 

because of the significance of the judgments and estimates described above it is likely that we could record materially different amounts if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances or estimates were to change 

​ 

our backlog includes both costtype and fixedprice contracts costtype contracts generally have lower profit margins than fixedprice contracts our earnings and margins may vary depending on the types of government contracts undertaken the nature of the work performed under those contracts the costs incurred in performing the work the achievement of other performance objectives and their impact on our ability to receive fees the fixedprice contracts could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate

​ 

as a us government contractor we could be adversely affected by changes in regulations or any negative findings from a us government audit or investigation 

​ 

our aerospace business operates in a highly regulated environment and is routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its agencies such as the defense contract audit agency dcaa and defense contract management agency dcma these agencies review performance under our contracts our cost structure and our compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies business systems that are subject to review under the dod federal acquisition regulation supplement dfars are purchasing estimating material management and accounting as well as property and earned value management any costs ultimately found to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if already reimbursed if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties sanctions or suspension or debarment from doing business with the us government whether or not illegal activities are alleged the us government also has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate if such actions were to result in suspension or debarment this could have a material adverse effect on our business 

​ 

our business is subject to substantial environmental remediation and compliance costs 

​ 

our operations are subject to federal state provincial and local laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions relating to environmental hazards such as emissions to air discharges to water the handling and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes and the cleanup of hazardous substances we have been designated along with numerous other companies as a potentially responsible party for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites additionally there is increased focus on the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental issues worldwide we strive to mitigate such risks related to environmental issues including through the purchase of renewable energy the adoption of sustainable practices and by positioning ourselves as a sustainability leader in our industry

​ 

our business faces the potential of increased regulation on some of the raw materials utilized in our packaging operations 

​ 

our operations are subject to federal state provincial and local laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions relating to some of the raw materials such as epoxybased coatings utilized in our container making process epoxybased coatings may contain bisphenola bpa scientific evidence evaluated by regulatory agencies in the us canada europe japan australia and new zealand has consistently shown these coatings to be safe for food contact at current levels and these regulatory agencies have stated that human exposure to bpa from epoxybased container coatings is well below safe exposure limits set by government bodies worldwide a significant change in these regulatory agency statements adverse information concerning bpa or rulings made within certain federal state provincial and local jurisdictions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations ball recognizes that significant interest exists in nonepoxy based coatings and we have been proactively working with coatings suppliers and our customers to transition to alternative coatings

​ 

net earnings and net assets could be materially affected by an impairment of goodwill 

​ 

we have a significant amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2019 we are required at least annually to test the recoverability of goodwill the recoverability test of goodwill is based on the current fair value of our identified reporting units fair value measurement requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors including revenue and market growth operating cash flows and discount rates if general market conditions deteriorate in portions of our business we could experience a significant decline in the fair value of reporting units this decline could lead to an impairment of all or a significant portion of the goodwill balance which could materially affect our us gaap net earnings and net assets 

​ 

if the investments in ball’s pension plans or in the multiemployer pension plans in which ball participates do not perform as expected we may have to contribute additional amounts to the plans which would otherwise be available for other general corporate purposes 

​ 

ball maintains defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of its employees in the united states and a significant number of united kingdom deferred and retired participants which are funded based on certain actuarial assumptions the plans’ assets consist primarily of common stocks fixedincome securities and in the us alternative investments market declines longevity increases or legislative changes such as the pension protection act in the us could result in a prospective decrease in our available cash flow and net earnings over time and the recognition of an increase in our pension obligations could result in a reduction to our shareholders’ equity additional risks exist related to the company’s participation in multiemployer pension plans assets contributed to a multiemployer pension plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers if a participating employer in a multiemployer pension plan stops contributing to the plan the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participants this could result in increases to our contributions to the plans as well as pension expense

​ 

restricted access to capital markets could adversely affect our shortterm liquidity and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the notes issued pursuant to our bond indentures 

​ 

a reduction in global market liquidity could

​ 

 ​ 

if market interest rates increase our variablerate debt will create higher debt service requirements which adversely affects our cash flow while we sometimes enter into agreements limiting our exposure any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk

​ 

the global credit financial and economic environment could have a negative impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

​ 

the overall credit financial and economic environment could have significant negative effects on our operations including

​ 

 ​ 

changes in us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap and sec rules and regulations could materially impact our reported results 

​ 

us gaap and sec accounting and reporting changes are common and have become more frequent and significant over the past several years these changes could have significant effects on our reported results when compared to prior periods and other companies and may even require us to retrospectively adjust prior periods additionally material changes to the presentation of transactions in the consolidated financial statements could impact key ratios that analysts and credit rating agencies use to rate ball and ultimately impact our ability to access the credit markets in an efficient manner

​ 

earnings and cash flows can be impacted by changes in tax laws 

​ 

as a usbased multinational business the company is subject to income tax in the us and numerous jurisdictions outside the us the relevant tax rules and regulations are complex often changing and in some cases are interdependent if these or other tax rules and regulations should change the company’s earnings and cash flows could be impacted

​ 

in particular the us tax cuts and jobs act the act which was signed into law on december 22 2017 may continue to result in fluctuations in the company’s net earnings and cash flows the act introduced major changes to us income tax law that require significant judgment to interpret the impact of the provisions of the act on the company’s financial results 

​ 

given the various uncertainties and ambiguities that still remain with respect to the application of the act the internal revenue service and the us treasury department may issue subsequent guidance on the provisions of the act including final regulations that differs from our current interpretations the impact of any adjustments required as a result of such subsequent guidance could materially affect the company’s financial results 

​ 

additionally on december 9 2019 a tax reform law was enacted in mexico which includes among other changes limitations on mexican companies’ ability to deduct certain expenses we do not currently expect that this law will materially affect us but that expectation could change with unanticipated enforcement or interpretation of the law

​ 

the company’s worldwide provision for income taxes is determined in part through the use of significant estimates and judgments numerous transactions arise in the ordinary course of business where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain the company undergoes tax examinations by various worldwide tax authorities on a regular basis while the company believes its estimates of its tax obligations are reasonable the final outcome after the conclusion of any tax examinations and any litigation could be materially different from what has been reflected in the company’s historical financial statements

​ 

increased information technology it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems networks products solutions and services 

​ 

the company’s it systems or any third party’s system on which the company relies could fail on their own accord or may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions or shutdowns including interruptions or shutdowns due to natural disasters power outages or telecommunications failures terrorist attacks or failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software or hardware increased global it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime also pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data as a provider of products and services to government and commercial customers our aerospace business in particular may be the target of cyberattacks including attempts to gain unauthorized access to classified or sensitive information and networks the company has a number of shared service centers where many of the company’s it systems are concentrated and any disruption at such a location could impact the company’s business within the operating zones served by the impacted service center 

​ 

while we attempt to mitigate all of these risks by employing a number of measures including employee training comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems networks products solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats or other it disruptions depending on their nature and scope such threats could potentially lead to the compromise of confidential information improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data defective products harm to individuals or property contractual or regulatory actions and fines penalties and potential liabilities production downtimes and operational disruptions which in turn could adversely affect our reputation competitiveness and results of operations data privacy and protection laws are evolving and present increasing compliance challenges which may increase our costs affect our competitiveness and could expose us to substantial fines or other penalties in addition a security breach that involves classified or other sensitive government information could subject us to civil or criminal penalties and could result in the loss of our secure facility clearance and other accreditation loss of our government contracts loss of access to classified information or debarment as a government contractor

​ 

a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could if not remediated result in material misstatements in our financial statements 

​ 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act a material weakness is defined as a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis if a material weakness is identified management could conclude that internal control over financial reporting is not effective based on criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organization of the treadway commission in “ internal control—an integrated framework 2013” if a material weakness is identified a remediation plan would be designed to address the material weakness if remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weakness or if additional material weaknesses in internal control are discovered or occur in the future our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results as of december 31 2019 the company had no material weaknesses

​ 

significant developments stemming from the uk’s referendum on membership in the eu could have a material adverse effect on us 

​ 

in june 2016 the uk held a referendum and voted in favor of leaving the european union eu and formally withdrew from the eu on january 31 2020 this withdrawal has created political and economic uncertainty particularly in the uk and the eu and this uncertainty may last for years particularly as the uk and the eu continue to negotiate the terms of their ongoing relationship our business in the uk the eu and worldwide could be affected by this uncertainty there are many ways in which our business could be affected only some of which we can identify at the present time such as supply chain constraints increased material costs due to rising tariffs effects on employee mobility and increased costs of doing business in the uk 

​ 

the referendum and the withdrawal of the uk from the eu has caused and along with events that could occur in the future as a consequence of the uk’s withdrawal including the possible breakup of the uk or the eu may continue to cause significant volatility in global financial markets including in global currency and debt markets a failure by the uk and the eu to conclude on a trade agreement may increase this volatility this volatility could cause a slowdown in economic activity in the uk europe or globally which could adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects in addition our business could be negatively affected by new trade agreements between the uk and other countries including the us and by the possible imposition of trade or other regulatory barriers in the uk these possible negative impacts and others resulting from the uk’s withdrawal from the eu may adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects

​ 

overview 

​ 

business overview and industry trends 

​ 

ball corporation is one of the world’s leading aluminum packaging suppliers our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses are manufactured in facilities around the world and are competitive with other substrates such as plastics and glass in the aluminum packaging industry sales and earnings can be increased by reducing costs increasing prices developing new products expanding volumes and making strategic acquisitions we also provide aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers including national defense hardware antenna and video tactical solutions civil and operational space hardware and system engineering services

​ 

we sell our aluminum packaging products mainly to large multinational beverage personal care and household products companies with which we have developed longterm relationships this is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of longterm supply contracts while we have a diversified customer base we sell a significant portion of our packaging products to major companies and brands as well as to numerous regional customers the overall global aluminum beverage and aerosol container industries are growing and are expected to continue to grow in the medium to long term the primary customers for the products and services provided by our aerospace segment are us government agencies or their prime contractors

​ 

we purchase our raw materials from relatively few suppliers we also have exposure to inflation in particular the rising costs of raw materials as well as other direct cost inputs we mitigate our exposure to the changes in the costs of aluminum through the inclusion of provisions in contracts covering the majority of our volumes to pass through aluminum price changes as well as through the use of derivative instruments the passthrough provisions generally result in proportional increases or decreases in sales and costs with a greatly reduced impact if any on net earnings because of our customer and supplier concentration our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss insolvency or bankruptcy of a major customer or supplier or a change in a supply agreement with a major customer or supplier although our contract provisions generally mitigate the risk of customer loss and our longterm relationships represent a known stable customer base

​ 

the majority of the aerospace business involves work under contracts generally from one to five years in duration as a prime contractor or subcontractor for various us government agencies intense competition and long operating cycles are key characteristics of the company’s aerospace and defense industry where it is common for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to a competitor become a subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting company

​ 

corporate strategy 

​ 

our drive for 10 vision encompasses five strategic levers that are key to growing our business and achieving longterm success since launching drive for 10 in 2011 we have made progress on each of the levers as follows

​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

these ongoing business developments help us stay close to our customers while expanding andor sustaining our industry positions and global reach with major beverage personal care household products and aerospace customers in order to successfully execute our strategy and reach our goals we realize the importance of excelling in the following areas customer focus operational excellence innovation and business development people and culture focus and sustainability

​ 

results of operations 

​ 

management’s discussion and analysis for our results of operations on a consolidated and segment basis include a quantification of factors that had a material impact other factors that did not have a material impact but that are significant to understand the results are qualitatively described

​ 

refer to item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the company’s annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2018  filed february 22 2019 for a comparison of the 2018 results of operations to the 2017 results 

​ 

consolidated sales and earnings 

​ 

 ​ 

sales in 2019 were 161 million lower compared to 2018 primarily as a result of selling the us and argentine steel food and steel aerosol businesses selling our china beverage packaging business the pass through of lower aluminum prices the conclusion of the south america segment’s end sales associated with the rexam acquisition and unfavorable exchange rates for our europe segment partially offset by higher beverage can unit volumes and higher pricing in our europe and north and central america segments and increased sales in the aerospace segment 

​ 

net earnings attributable to ball corporation in 2019 were 112 million higher than 2018 primarily due to higher beverage can unit volumes and prices increased sales in the aerospace segment lower selling general and administrative expenses and lower income tax expense partially offset by the conclusion of our south america segment’s end sales agreement associated with the rexam acquisition higher interest expense higher business consolidation and other costs unfavorable us aluminum scrap rates and manufacturing inefficiencies experienced in our north and central america segment 

​ 

cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization 

​ 

cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization was 9203 million in 2019 compared to 9329 million in 2018 these amounts represented 80 percent of consolidated net sales for the years ended 2019 and 2018 

​ 

depreciation and amortization 

​ 

depreciation and amortization expense was 678 million in 2019 compared to 702 million in 2018 these amounts represented 6 percent of consolidated net sales for 2019 and 2018 amortization expense in 2019 and 2018 included 155 million and 164 million respectively for the amortization of acquired rexam intangibles

​ 

selling general and administrative 

​ 

selling general and administrative sga expenses were 417 million in 2019 compared to 478 million in 2018 these amounts represented 4 percent of consolidated net sales for both years 

​ 

business consolidation costs and other activities 

​ 

business consolidation and other activities were 244 million in 2019 compared to 191 million in 2018 these amounts represented 2 percent of consolidated net sales for both years

​ 

the yearoveryear increase in business consolidation and other activities in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to charges related to the impairment of longlived and other assets in saudi arabia and the sale of the china beverage packaging and argentine steel aerosol businesses partially offset by a gain on indirect taxes in brazil

interest expense 

​ 

total interest expense was 324 million in 2019 compared to 302 million in 2018 interest expense was higher in 2019 as compared to 2018 as the average level of debt held was higher than the preceding period interest expense excluding the effect of debt refinancing and other costs as a percentage of average monthly borrowings was 4 percent in 2019 and 2018

​ 

tax provision 

​ 

the company’s effective tax rate is affected by recurring items such as income earned in foreign jurisdictions with tax rates that differ from the us tax rate and by discrete items that may occur in any given year but are not consistent from year to year 

​ 

the 2019 effective income tax rate was 117 percent compared to 292 percent for 2018 as compared with the statutory us federal income tax rate of 21 percent the 2019 effective rate was reduced by 71 percent for equity compensation benefits by 31 percent for various uncertain tax positions and by 16 percent for the impact of the us rd credit these reductions were partially offset by an increase of 20 percent due to the tax on global intangible lowtaxed income gilti while these items are expected to recur the potential magnitude of each item is uncertain

​ 

further details of taxes on income and the impacts of the us tax reform are included in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report

​ 

results of business segments 

​ 

segment results 

​ 

ball’s operations are organized and reviewed by management along its product lines and geographical areas and its operating results are presented in the four reportable segments discussed below

​ 

beverage packaging north and central america 

​ 

 

 ​ 

segment sales in 2019 were 132 million higher compared to 2018 the increase in 2019 was primarily due to higher volumes of 192 million and improved customer sales mix partially offset by the pass through of lower aluminum prices we cannot predict the impact on sales that will result from future changes in aluminum input prices 

​ 

comparable operating earnings in 2019 were 4 million higher compared to 2018 primarily due to higher sales volumes and improved customer sales mix partially offset by unfavorable us aluminum scrap rates increased startup costs and operational inefficiencies

beverage packaging south america 

​ 

 

 ​ 

segment sales in 2019 were 31 million lower compared to 2018 the decrease in 2019 was primarily related to the pass through of lower aluminum prices the conclusion of the end sales agreement associated with the rexam acquisition and regional pricemix partially offset by higher can and end volumes of 132 million

​ 

comparable operating earnings in 2019 were 25 million lower compared to 2018 primarily related to the conclusion of the end sales agreement associated with the rexam acquisition regional pricemix and unfavorable currency exchange rates partially offset by higher can and end volumes

​ 

beverage packaging europe 

​ 

 

 ​ 

segment sales in 2019 were 32 million higher compared to 2018 the increase in 2019 was primarily due to higher sales volumes of 188 million partially offset by unfavorable currency exchange rates of 147 million and the pass through of lower aluminum prices 

​ 

comparable operating earnings in 2019 were 26 million higher compared to 2018 primarily due to increased sales volumes pricemix and operational efficiencies from plant network optimization partially offset by unfavorable currency exchange rates 

aerospace 

​ 

 ​ 

segment sales in 2019 were 283 million higher compared to 2018 and comparable operating earnings were 27 million higher the increase in sales and operating earnings for 2019 was primarily the result of increases from significant us national defense contracts

​ 

sales to the us government either directly as a prime contractor or indirectly as a subcontractor represented 98 percent of segment sales in 2019 compared to 99 percent of segment sales in 2018 the aerospace contract mix in 2019 consisted of 64 percent costtype contracts which are billed at our costs plus an agreedupon andor earned profit component and 34 percent fixedprice contracts the remaining sales were for time and materials contracts

​ 

contracted backlog for the aerospace segment at december 31 2019 and 2018 was 25 billion and 22 billion respectively the yearoveryear increase reflects several major contract awards during 2019 the segment has numerous outstanding bids for future contract awards the backlog at december 31 2019 consisted of 55 percent costtype contracts comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations due to the nature of varying delivery and milestone schedules on contracts funding of programs and the uncertainty of timing of future contract awards

​ 

management performance measures 

​ 

management internally uses various measures to evaluate company performance such as comparable operating earnings earnings before interest taxes and business consolidation and other noncomparable costs comparable net earnings earnings before business consolidation costs and other noncomparable costs after tax comparable diluted earnings per share comparable net earnings divided by diluted weighted average shares outstanding return on average invested capital net operating earnings after tax over the relevant performance period divided by average invested capital over the same period economic value added eva® dollars net operating earnings after tax less a capital charge on average invested capital employed earnings before interest and taxes ebit earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda and diluted earnings per share management also uses free cash flow generally defined by the company as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures as a measure to evaluate the company’s liquidity we believe this information is also useful to investors as it provides insight into the earnings and cash flow criteria management uses to make strategic decisions these financial measures may be adjusted at times for items that affect comparability between periods such as business consolidation costs and gains or losses on acquisitions and dispositions

​ 

nonfinancial measures in the packaging businesses include production efficiency and spoilage rates quality control figures environmental health and safety statistics production and sales volumes asset utilization rates and measures of sustainability additional measures used to evaluate financial performance in the aerospace segment include contract revenue realization award and incentive fees realized proposal win rates and backlog including awarded contracted and funded backlog

​ 

many of the above noted financial measurements are presented on a nonus gaap basis and should be considered in connection with the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report nonus gaap measures should not be considered in isolation and should not be considered superior to or a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with us gaap a presentation of earnings in accordance with us gaap is available in item 8 of this annual report

​ 

based on the above definitions our calculations of comparable operating earnings comparable net earnings comparable diluted earnings per share and free cash flow are summarized in the tables included within item 6 of this annual report on form 10k 

​ 

critical and significant accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements 

​ 

for information regarding the company’s critical and significant accounting policies as well as recent accounting pronouncements see notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report

​ 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

​ 

cash flows and capital expenditures 

​ 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities and external committed borrowings we believe that cash flows from operations cash on hand and cash provided by shortterm longterm and committed revolver borrowings when necessary will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements scheduled principal and interest payments on debt dividend payments and anticipated capital expenditures the following table summarizes our cash flows

​ 

 

 ​ 

cash flows provided by operations were lower in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to higher pension contributions partially offset by higher earnings the impact of changes in working capital on operating cash flows for 2019 was a 236 million inflow excluding the impact of the sale of the us steel food and steel aerosol packaging business in 2018 and the sale of the china beverage packaging and argentina steel aerosol businesses in 2019 our working capital movements reflect a decrease of days sales outstanding from 42 days in 2018 to 39 days in 2019 and an increase in days payable outstanding from 112 days in 2018 to 121 days in 2019

​ 

we have entered into several regional committed and uncommitted accounts receivable factoring programs with various financial institutions for certain of our accounts receivable programs accounted for as true sales of the receivables without recourse to ball had combined limits of approximately 14 billion and 12 billion at december 31 2019 and december 31 2018 respectively a total of 230 million and 178 million were available for sale under these programs at december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively 

​ 

as of december 31 2019 approximately 921 million of our cash was held outside of the us in the event that we would need to utilize any of the cash held outside of the us for purposes within the us there are no material legal or other economic restrictions regarding the repatriation of cash from any of the countries outside the us where we have cash the company believes its us operating cash flows cash on hand as well as availability under its longterm revolving credit facilities uncommitted shortterm credit facilities and committed and uncommitted accounts receivable factoring programs will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of the us portion of our ongoing operations scheduled principal and interest payments on us debt dividend payments capital expenditures and other us cash requirements if foreign funds would be needed for our us cash requirements and we are unable to provide the funds through intercompany financing arrangements we would be required to repatriate funds from foreign locations where the company has previously asserted indefinite reinvestment of funds outside the us 

​ 

based on its indefinite reinvestment assertion the company has not provided deferred taxes on earnings in certain nonus subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in its international operations it is not practical to estimate the additional taxes that may become payable if these earnings were remitted to the us

share repurchases 

​ 

the company’s share repurchases net of issuances totaled 945 million in 2019 and 711 million in 2018 the repurchases were completed using cash on hand cash provided by operating activities proceeds from the sale of businesses and available borrowings 

​ 

debt facilities and refinancing 

​ 

given our cash flow projections and unused credit facilities that are available until march 2024 our liquidity is strong and is expected to meet our ongoing cash and debt service requirements total interestbearing debt was 78 billion at december 31 2019 compared to 67 billion at december 31 2018

​ 

in november 2019 ball issued €13 billion in aggregate principal amount of 150 and 0875 eurodenominated senior notes for general corporate purposes 

​ 

in january 2020 ball redeemed the outstanding eurodenominated 350 senior notes due in 2020 in the amount of €400 million and the outstanding 4375 senior notes due in 2020 in the amount of 1 billion 

​ 

in march 2019 the company refinanced its existing credit facilities with a us dollar term loan facility a us dollar revolving facility and a multicurrency revolving facility that mature in march 2024 the revolving facilities provide the company with up to the us dollar equivalent of 175 billion 

​ 

in march 2018 ball issued 750 million of 4875 senior notes and used the proceeds to repay 315 million of its term a loan as well as outstanding multicurrency revolver and shortterm credit facility borrowings 

​ 

at december 31 2019 taking into account outstanding letters of credit approximately 17 billion was available under the company’s longterm multicurrency committed revolving credit facilities which are available until march 2024 in addition to these facilities the company had 1 billion of shortterm uncommitted credit facilities available at december 31 2019 of which 26 million was outstanding and due on demand 

​ 

while ongoing financial and economic conditions in certain areas may raise concerns about credit risk with counterparties to derivative transactions the company mitigates its exposure by allocating the risk among various counterparties and limiting exposure to any one party we also monitor the credit ratings of our suppliers customers lenders and counterparties on a regular basis

​ 

we were in compliance with all loan agreements at december 31 2019 and for all prior years presented and have met all debt payment obligations the us note agreements and bank credit agreement contain certain restrictions relating to dividends investments financial ratios guarantees and the incurrence of additional indebtedness the most restrictive of the company’s debt covenants requires the company to maintain a leverage ratio as defined of no greater than 45 times at december 31 2019 as of december 31 2019 approximately 22 billion of the amounts disclosed as available under the company’s longterm multicurrency committed revolving facilities and shortterm uncommitted credit facilities are available without violating our existing debt covenants additional details about our debt are available in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report

​ 

other liquidity measures 

​ 

free cash flow 

​ 

management internally uses a free cash flow measure to 1 evaluate the company’s liquidity 2 evaluate strategic investments 3 plan stock buyback and dividend levels and 4 evaluate the company’s ability to incur and service debt free cash flow is not a defined term under us gaap and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures the company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures free cash flow is typically derived directly from the company’s consolidated statement of cash flows however it may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods

​ 

based on the above definition our consolidated free cash flow is summarized as follows

​ 

 

 ​ 

based on information currently available we estimate cash flows from operating activities for 2020 to be approximately 14 billion capital expenditures to be in the range of 800 million and free cash flow to be in the range of 600 million in 2020 we intend to utilize our operating cash flow to fund our growth capital projects dividend payments stock buybacks service debt and to the extent available acquisitions that meet our criteria approximately 560 million of capital expenditures was contractually committed as of december 31 2019

​ 

commitments 

​ 

cash payments required for longterm debt maturities and interest payments rental payments under noncancellable operating leases and purchase obligations in effect at december 31 2019 are summarized in the following table 

​ 

 

 ​ 

the table above excludes 63 million of uncertain tax positions as the ultimate timing of resolution for these matters is unknown at this time 

​ 

also excluded from the table above are contributions to the company’s defined benefit pension plans which are expected to be approximately 90 million in 2020 this estimate may change based on changes in the pension protection act actual plan asset performance and available company cash flow among other factors benefit payments related to the plans are expected to be approximately 393 million 361 million 366 million 370 million and 373 million for the years ending december 31 2020 through 2024 respectively and approximately 19 billion for the years ending december 31 2025 through 2029 

based on changes in return on asset and discount rate assumptions as well as revisions based on plan experience studies total pension expense in 2020 is anticipated to be approximately 2 million higher than in 2019 a reduction of the expected return on pension assets assumption by one quarter of a percentage point would result in an increase of approximately 14 million in total 2020 pension expense while a quarter of a percentage point reduction in the discount rate applied to the pension liability would result in an estimated 1 million increase of pension expense in 2020 additional details about our defined benefit pension plans are available in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report

​ 

contingencies 

​ 

the company is routinely subject to litigation incident to operating its businesses and has been designated by various federal and state environmental agencies as a potentially responsible party along with numerous other companies for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites including in respect of sites related to alleged activities of certain rexam subsidiaries the company believes the matters identified will not have a material adverse effect upon its liquidity results of operations or financial condition details of the company’s legal proceedings are included in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

​ 

financial instruments and risk management 

​ 

the company employs established risk management policies and procedures which seek to reduce the company’s commercial risk exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices interest rates currency exchange rates and prices of the company’s common stock with regard to common share repurchases and the company’s deferred compensation stock plan however there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be successful although the instruments utilized involve varying degrees of credit market and interest risk the counterparties to the agreements are expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements the company monitors counterparty credit risk including lenders on a regular basis but ball cannot be certain that all risks will be discerned or that its risk management policies and procedures will always be effective additionally in the event of default under the company’s master derivative agreements the nondefaulting party has the option to set off any amounts owed with regard to open derivative positions 

​ 

we have estimated our market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis market risk exposure has been defined as the changes in fair value of derivative instruments financial instruments and commodity positions to test the sensitivity of our market risk exposure we have estimated the changes in fair value of market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in market prices or rates the results of the sensitivity analyses are summarized below

​ 

commodity price risk 

​ 

aluminum 

​ 

we manage commodity price risk in connection with market price fluctuations of aluminum ingot through two different methods first we enter into container sales contracts that include aluminum ingotbased pricing terms that generally reflect the same price fluctuations included in commercial purchase contracts for aluminum sheet the terms include fixed floating or passthrough aluminum ingot component pricing second we use derivative instruments such as option and forward contracts as economic and cash flow hedges of commodity price risk where there are material differences between sales and purchase contracted pricing and volume

​ 

considering the effects of derivative instruments the company’s ability to pass through certain raw material costs through contractual provisions the market’s ability to accept price increases and the company’s commodity price exposures under its contract terms a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the company’s aluminum prices would result in an estimated 3 million aftertax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period additionally the company has currency exposures on raw materials and the effect of a 10 percent adverse change is included in the total currency exposure discussed below actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates

​ 

interest rate risk 

​ 

our objective in managing exposure to interest rate changes is to minimize the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to minimize our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we may use a variety of interest rate swaps collars and options to manage our mix of floating and fixedrate debt interest rate instruments held by the company at december 31 2019 included payfixed interest rate swaps which effectively convert variable rate obligations to fixedrate instruments

​ 

based on our interest rate exposure at december 31 2019 assumed floating rate debt levels throughout the next 12 months and the effects of our existing derivative instruments a 100basis point increase in interest rates would result in an estimated 3 million aftertax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates and the timing of these changes

​ 

currency exchange rate risk 

​ 

our objective in managing exposure to currency fluctuations is to limit the exposure of cash flows and earnings from changes associated with currency exchange rate changes through the use of various derivative contracts in addition at times ball manages earnings translation volatility through the use of currency option strategies and the change in the fair value of those options is recorded in the company’s net earnings our currency translation risk results from the currencies in which we transact business the company faces currency exposures in our global operations as a result of various factors including intercompany currency denominated loans selling our products in various currencies purchasing raw materials and equipment in various currencies and tax exposures not denominated in the functional currency sales contracts are negotiated with customers to reflect cost changes and where there is not an exchange passthrough arrangement the company may use forward and option contracts to manage significant currency exposures

​ 

considering the company’s derivative financial instruments outstanding at december 31 2019 and the various currency exposures a hypothetical 10 percent reduction us dollar strengthening mainly against the russian ruble in currency exchange rates compared to the us dollar would result in an estimated 27 million aftertax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period this hypothetical adverse change in currency exchange rates would also reduce our forecasted average debt balance by 224 million actual changes in market prices or rates may differ from hypothetical changes

 item 1 business 

  

ball corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries collectively ball the company we or our is one of the world’s leading suppliers of metal packaging to the beverage personal care and household products industries the company was organized in 1880 and incorporated in the state of indiana united states of america us in 1922 our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses and are manufactured in facilities around the world we also provide aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers within our aerospace segment in 2018 our total consolidated net sales were 12 billion our packaging businesses were responsible for 90 percent of our net sales with the remaining 10 percent contributed by our aerospace business 

  

our largest product line is aluminum beverage containers we also produce aerosol containers extruded aluminum aerosol containers and aluminum slugs 

  

we sell our packaging products mainly to large multinational beverage personal care and household products companies with which we have developed longterm relationships this is evidenced by our high customer retention and large number of longterm supply contracts while we have a diversified customer base we sell a significant portion of our packaging products to major companies and brands as well as to numerous regional customers our significant customers include the cocacola company and its affiliated bottlers anheuserbusch inbev nvsa molson coors brewing company and unilever nv 

  

our aerospace business is a leader in the design development and manufacture of innovative aerospace systems for civil commercial and national cyber security aerospace markets it produces spacecraft instruments and sensors radio frequency systems and components data exploitation solutions and a variety of advanced aerospace technologies and products that enable deep space missions 

  

we are headquartered in broomfield colorado and our stock is listed for trading on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol bll 

  

our strategy 

  

our overall business strategy is defined by our drive for 10 vision which at its highest level is a mindset around perfection with a greater sense of urgency around our future success launched in 2011 our drive for 10 vision encompasses five strategic levers that are key to growing our businesses and achieving longterm success these five levers are 

  











  

we also maintain a clear and disciplined financial strategy focused on improving shareholder returns through 

  







  

 

the cash generated by our businesses is used primarily 1 to finance the company’s operations 2 to fund strategic capital investments 3 to service the company’s debt and 4 to return value to our shareholders via stock buybacks and dividend payments from time to time we have evaluated and expect to continue to evaluate possible transactions that we believe will benefit the company and our shareholders which may include strategic acquisitions divestitures of parts of our company or joint ventures at any time we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to possible transactions or may have entered into nonbinding letters of intent there can be no assurance if or when we will enter into any such transactions or the terms of such transactions the compensation of many of our employees is tied directly to the company’s performance through our eva®based incentive programs 

  

sustainability 

  

sustainability is a key part of our business strategy at ball by enhancing the unique sustainability credentials of our products along their life cycles we position our metal containers as the most sustainable packaging choice and help our customers grow their businesses aluminum is an infinitely recyclable material it also has the highest scrap value of all commonly used packaging substrates these qualities make cans an increasingly attractive option for sustainabilityconscious consumers and brands who acknowledge that metal packaging is a true enabler of a circular economy in terms of economic value recyclability real recycling and the avoidance of down cycling in 2017 resource recycling systems recognized aluminum beverage cans as the most recycled beverage package in the world with a global weighted average recycling rate for aluminum of 69 percent this finding solidifies the aluminum can as the leader in real recycling where the package is collected and then transformed into an item of equal value product to product or material to material recycling in comparison only 43 percent of pet and 46 percent of glass bottles were collected for recycling although not necessarily recycled 

  

in some of ball’s markets such as brazil china and several european countries recycling rates for aluminum beverage cans are at or above 90 percent the most recently available recycling rates for aluminum beverage cans are 97 percent in brazil in 2017 74 percent in europe in 2015 and 49 percent in the us in 2016 

  

we focus our sustainability efforts on product stewardship operational excellence talent management and community engagement in our global operations we work on continuous improvement of employee safety energy and water efficiency waste generation and air emissions 

  

because metal recycling saves resources and uses significantly less energy than primary metal production the biggest opportunity to further enhance the positive environmental attributes of metal packaging is to increase recycling rates in markets where recycling rates are below where we believe they should be we help establish and financially support packaging collection and recycling initiatives these initiatives typically focus on collaborating with public and private partners to create effective collection and recycling systems including education of consumers about the sustainability benefits of metal packaging 

  

our reportable segments 

  

ball corporation reports its financial performance in four reportable segments 1 beverage packaging north and central america 2 beverage packaging south america 3 beverage packaging europe and 4 aerospace ball also has investments in the us guatemala panama south korea and vietnam that are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and accordingly those results are not included in segment sales or earnings financial information related to each of our segments is included in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report on form 10k annual report 

  

on july 31 2018 ball sold its us steel food and steel aerosol packaging business and formed a joint venture ball metalpack see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report for further information as a result of the sale the remaining global aluminum aerosol and argentine steel aerosol businesses of the legacy food and aerosol packaging segment are now a nonreportable segment that manufactures and sells aerosol containers extruded aluminum aerosol containers and aluminum slugs aerosol packaging for comparative periods the entire former food and aerosol packaging segment is now presented within other 

  

 

beverage packaging north and central america segment 

  

beverage packaging north and central america is ball’s largest segment accounting for 40 percent of consolidated net sales in 2018 metal beverage containers are primarily sold under multiyear supply contracts to fillers of carbonated soft drinks beer energy drinks and other beverages 

  

metal beverage containers and ends are produced at 17 manufacturing facilities in the us one in canada and two in mexico the beverage packaging north and central america segment also includes interests in three joint ventures that are accounted for using the equity method 

  

the north american beverage container manufacturing industry is relatively mature where growth or contractions are projected in certain markets or for certain products ball undertakes selected capacity increases or decreases primarily in its existing facilities to meet market demand a meaningful portion of the industrywide reduction in demand for standard 12ounce aluminum cans for the carbonated soft drink market is being offset with growing demand for specialty container volumes from new and existing customers and consumer demand during 2016 we began production at our newly constructed beverage can and end manufacturing facility in monterrey mexico in order to serve growing customer demand for specialty cans in the southwestern us the company constructed a four line beverage packaging facility in goodyear arizona which began production in the second quarter of 2018 

  

according to publicly available information and company estimates the north american beverage container industry represents approximately 112 billion units five companies manufacture substantially all of the metal beverage containers in the us canada and mexico ball produced approximately 46 billion recyclable aluminum beverage containers in north america in 2018 which represented approximately 44 percent of the aggregate production in these countries historically sales volumes of metal beverage containers in north america tend to be highest during the period from april through september all of the beverage containers produced by ball in the us canada and mexico are made of aluminum in north and central america five suppliers provide the majority of our aluminum can and end sheet requirements  

  

beverage containers are sold based on price quality service innovation and sustainability in a highly competitive market which is relatively capital intensive and characterized by facilities that run more or less continuously in order to operate profitably in addition the metal beverage container competes aggressively with other packaging materials which include meaningful industry positions by the glass bottle in the packaged beer industry and the polyethylene terephthalate pet bottle in the carbonated soft drink and water industries 

  

we believe we have limited our exposure to changes in the cost of aluminum ingot as a result of the inclusion of provisions in most metal beverage container sales contracts to pass through aluminum price changes as well as through the use of derivative instruments 

  

our beverage can manufacturing facility in reidsville north carolina ceased production at the end of june 2017 the birmingham alabama facility ceased production during the second quarter of 2018 and the chatsworth california and longview texas facilities ceased production during the third quarter of 2018 these facilities produced beverage cans in a variety of sizes and their customers are now supplied by the company’s other us facilities 

  

beverage packaging south america segment 

  

the beverage packaging south america segment accounted for 15 percent of ball’s consolidated net sales in 2018 our operations consist of 12 facilities 10 in brazil and one each in argentina and chile for the countries where we operate the south american beverage container market is approximately 31 billion containers and we are the largest producer in this region with an estimated 53 percent of south american shipments in 2018 four companies currently manufacture substantially all of the metal beverage containers in brazil 

  

the company’s south american beverage facilities produced approximately 16 billion aluminum beverage containers in 2018 historically sales volumes of beverage containers in south america tend to be highest during the period from september through december in south america two suppliers provide virtually all our aluminum sheet requirements with certain requirements also being imported from asia 

  

 

in order to support contracted volumes for aluminum beverage packaging across paraguay argentina chile and bolivia the company is constructing a oneline beverage can and end manufacturing facility in paraguay and will add capacity to its buenos aires argentina and santiago chile facilities the paraguay facility is expected to begin production in the second half of 2019 the company ceased operations at its cuiabá brazil beverage packaging facility in july 2018 and has relocated equipment from the cuiabá facility to other existing facilities in south america 

  

we believe we have limited our exposure to changes in the cost of aluminum ingot as a result of the inclusion of provisions in most metal beverage container sales contracts to pass through aluminum ingot price changes as well as through the use of derivative instruments 

  

beverage packaging europe segment 

  

the beverage packaging europe segment accounted for 23 percent of ball’s consolidated net sales in 2018 our european operations consist of 20 facilities throughout europe the european beverage container market is approximately 67 billion containers including russia and excluding turkey and we are the largest producer with an estimated 43 percent of european shipments the european market is highly regional in terms of sales growth rates and packaging mix four companies manufacture substantially all of the metal beverage containers in europe our european beverage facilities produced 30 billion beverage containers in 2018 the vast majority of which were produced from aluminum 

  

historically sales volumes of metal beverage containers in europe tend to be highest during the period from may through august with a smaller increase in demand leading up to the winter holiday season in the uk offset by much lower demand in russia much like other parts of the world the metal beverage container competes aggressively with other packaging materials used by the european beer and carbonated soft drink industries the glass bottle is heavily utilized in the packaged beer industry while the pet container is utilized in the carbonated soft drink beer juice and water industries 

  

european raw material supply contracts generally have longer term agreements in europe five aluminum suppliers and one steel supplier provide almost all of our requirements aluminum is traded primarily in us dollars while the functional currencies of our european operations are various other currencies the company minimizes its exchange rate risk using derivative and supply contracts in local currencies purchase and sales contracts generally include fixedprice floating or passthrough aluminum ingot component pricing arrangements 

  

in order to support growth for beverage cans in the iberian peninsula the company constructed a twoline aluminum beverage can manufacturing facility near madrid spain with a majority of the facility’s capacity secured under a longterm customer contract the facility is fully operational and produces multiple can sizes utilizing both lines in the third quarter of 2017 our beverage packaging container and end production facilities in recklinghausen germany ceased production and the capacity was transitioned to existing european ball facilities in december 2018 we closed a oneline beverage packaging facility located in san martino italy 

aerospace segment 

  

ball’s aerospace segment which accounted for 10 percent of consolidated net sales in 2018 includes national defense hardware antenna and video tactical solutions civil and operational space hardware and systems engineering services the segment develops spacecraft sensors and instruments radio frequency systems and other advanced technologies for the civil commercial and national security aerospace markets the majority of the aerospace business involves work under contracts generally from one to five years in duration as a prime contractor or subcontractor for the us department of defense dod the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and other us government agencies the company competes against both large and small prime contractors and subcontractors for these contracts contracts funded by the various agencies of the federal government represented 99 percent of segment sales in 2018 

  

intense competition and long operating cycles are key characteristics of both the company’s business and the aerospace and defense industry it is common in the aerospace and defense industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to a competitor become a subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting company it is not unusual to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or a customer of that same competitor on other contracts or vice versa 

  

 

geopolitical events and shifting executive and legislative branch priorities have resulted in an increase in opportunities over the past decade in areas matching our aerospace segment’s core capabilities in space hardware the businesses include hardware and services sold primarily to us customers with emphasis on space science and exploration environmental and earth sciences and defense and intelligence applications major activities frequently involve the design manufacture and testing of satellites remote sensors and ground station control hardware and software as well as related services such as launch vehicle integration and satellite operations 

other hardware activities include target identification warning and attitude control systems and components cryogenic systems for reactant storage and associated sensor cooling devices star trackers which are generalpurpose stellar attitude sensors and faststeering mirrors additionally the aerospace segment provides diversified technical services and products to government agencies prime contractors and commercial organizations for a broad range of information warfare electronic warfare avionics intelligence training and space system needs 

  

contracted backlog in the aerospace segment was 22 billion and 175 billion at december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively and consisted of the aggregate contract value of firm orders excluding amounts previously recognized as revenue the 2018 contracted backlog includes 11 billion expected to be recognized in revenues during 2019 with the remainder expected to be recognized in revenues in the years thereafter unfunded amounts included in backlog for certain firm government orders which are subject to annual funding were 14 billion and 13 billion at december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively yearoveryear comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations due to the nature of varying delivery and milestone schedules on contracts funding of programs and the uncertainty of timing of future contract awards uncertainties in the federal government budgeting process could delay the funding or even result in cancellation of certain programs currently in our reported backlog

 item 1a risk factors 

  

any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of rexam or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected we may also encounter significant unexpected difficulties in integrating the two businesses 

  

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of rexam will depend to a large extent on our ability to integrate our beverage packaging business with rexam’s business combining two independent businesses is a complex costly and timeconsuming process as a result we are required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of the company and the rexam business we acquired the integration process may disrupt the combined business and if implemented ineffectively could preclude the realization of the full benefits of the acquisition that are currently expected our failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the two businesses and to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in the activities of the company and could adversely affect the company’s results of operations in addition the overall integration of the businesses may result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses loss of customer relationships and diversion of management’s attention the possible difficulties of combining the operations of the companies also include among others 

  

















  

many of these factors are or will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy which could materially impact the business financial condition and results of operations of the company in addition even if the operations of the businesses of the company and rexam are integrated successfully we may not realize the full benefits of the acquisition including the synergies cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect or the full benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the businesses of the company and rexam all of these factors could adversely affect the earnings of the company decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisition or negatively impact the price of the company’s common stock as a result we cannot assure that the combination of the company’s and rexam’s beverage packaging businesses will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the acquisition 

  

in connection with satisfying requirements under the antitrust laws of the us the european union and brazil and obtaining associated approvals and clearances we were required to effect significant divestitures as a result of the required divestitures we may not realize all or a significant portion of the anticipated benefits of the rexam acquisition including anticipated synergies and the company may otherwise suffer other negative consequences that may materially and adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations and to the extent that the current price of the company’s common stock reflects an assumption that the anticipated benefits of the acquisition will be realized the price per share for the company’s common stock could be negatively impacted 

  

 

we have a significant level of debt that could have important consequences for our business and any investment in our securities 

  

the company had 67 billion of interestbearing debt at december 31 2018 such indebtedness could have significant consequences for our business and any investment in our securities including 

  











  

our business operating results and financial condition are subject to particular risks in certain regions of the world 

  

we may experience an operating loss in one or more regions of the world for one or more periods which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition moreover overcapacity which often leads to lower prices exists in certain regions in which we operate and may persist even if demand grows our ability to manage such operational fluctuations and to maintain adequate longterm strategies in the face of such developments will be critical to our continued growth and profitability 

  

the loss of a key customer or a reduction in its requirements could have a significant negative impact on our sales 

  

we sell a majority of our packaging products to a relatively limited number of major beverage personal care and household product companies some of which operate in multiple geographical markets we serve 

  

although the majority of our customer contracts are longterm these contracts unless they are renewed expire in accordance with their respective terms and are terminable under certain circumstances such as our failure to meet quality volume or market pricing requirements because we depend on a relatively limited number of major customers our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss of any of these customers a reduction in the purchasing levels of these customers a strike or work stoppage by a significant number of these customers’ employees or an adverse change in the terms of the supply agreements with these customers 

  

the primary customers for our aerospace segment are us government agencies or their prime contractors our contracts with these customers are subject to several risks including funding cuts and delays technical uncertainties budget changes government shutdowns competitive activity and changes in scope 

  

we face competitive risks from many sources that may negatively impact our profitability 

  

competition within the packaging and aerospace industries is intense increases in productivity combined with existing or potential surplus capacity in the industry have maintained competitive pricing pressures the principal methods of competition in the general packaging industry are price innovation sustainability service and quality in the aerospace industry they are technical capability cost and schedule some of our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources and some may currently have excess capacity our current or potential competitors may offer products at a lower price or products that are deemed superior to ours the global economic environment has resulted in reductions in demand for our products in some instances which in turn could increase these competitive pressures 

  

 

we are subject to competition from alternative products which could result in lower profits and reduced cash flows 

  

our metal packaging products are subject to significant competition from substitute products particularly plastic carbonated soft drink bottles made from pet single serve beer bottles and other beverage containers made of glass cardboard or other materials competition from plastic carbonated soft drink bottles is particularly intense in the us europe and the prc certain of our aerospace products are also subject to competition from alternative products and solutions there can be no assurance that our products will successfully compete against alternative products which could result in a reduction in our profits or cash flow 

  

our packaging businesses have a narrow product range and our business would suffer if usage of our products decreased or if decreases occur in the demand for the beverages and other goods filled in our products 

  

the majority of our consolidated net sales were from the sale of beverage containers and we expect to derive a significant portion of our future revenues and cash flows from the sale of beverage containers our business would suffer if the use of beverage containers decreased accordingly broad acceptance by consumers of aluminum containers for a wide variety of beverages is critical to our future success if demand for glass and pet bottles increases relative to metal containers or the demand for aluminum containers does not develop as expected our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

  

changes in laws and governmental regulations may adversely affect our business and operations 

  

we and our customers and suppliers are subject to various federal state provincial and local laws and regulations which have been increasing in number and complexity each of our and their facilities is subject to federal state provincial and local licensing and regulation by health environmental workplace safety and other agencies in multiple jurisdictions requirements of worldwide governmental authorities with respect to manufacturing manufacturing facility locations within the jurisdiction product content and safety climate change workplace safety and health environmental expropriation of assets and other standards could adversely affect our ability to manufacture or sell our products and the ability of our customers and suppliers to manufacture and sell their products in addition we face risks arising from compliance with and enforcement of numerous and complex federal state provincial and local laws and regulations 

  

enacted regulatory developments regarding the reporting and use of “conflict minerals” mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries could affect the sourcing availability and price of minerals used in the manufacture of certain of our products as a result there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflictfree materials and we cannot give assurance that we will be able to obtain such products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices also because our supply chains are complex we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of all materials used in the products that we sell the compliance and reporting aspects of these regulations may result in incremental costs to the company while deposit systems and other containerrelated legislation have been adopted in some jurisdictions similar legislation has been defeated in public referenda and legislative bodies in many others we anticipate that continuing efforts will be made to consider and adopt such legislation in the future the packages we produce are widely used and perform well in us states canadian provinces and european countries that have deposit systems as well as in other countries worldwide 

  

significant environmental employmentrelated and other legislation and regulatory requirements exist and are also evolving the compliance costs associated with current and proposed laws and potential regulations could be substantial and any failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws or regulations could lead to litigation or governmental action all of which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

  

 

our business financial condition and results of operations are subject to risks resulting from broader geographic operations 

  

we derived more than 50 percent of our consolidated net sales from outside of the us for the year ended december 31 2018 the sizeable scope of operations outside of the us may lead to more volatile financial results and make it more difficult for us to manage our business reasons for this include but are not limited to the following 

  













  

we are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations 

  

the financial results of the company are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations and an increased proportion of assets liabilities and earnings denominated in nonus dollar currencies the company presents its financial statements in us dollars and has a significant proportion of its net assets debt and income in nonus dollar currencies primarily the euro as well as the russian ruble and other emerging market currencies the company’s financial results and capital ratios are therefore sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates 

  

we manage our exposure to currency fluctuations particularly our exposure to fluctuations in the euro to us dollar exchange rate to attempt to mitigate the effect of cash flow and earnings volatility associated with exchange rate changes we primarily use forward contracts and options to manage our currency exposures and as a result we experience gains and losses on these derivative positions offset in part by the impact of currency fluctuations on existing assets and liabilities 

  

if we fail to retain key management and personnel we may be unable to implement our key objectives 

  

we believe our future success depends in part on our experienced management team unforeseen losses of key members of our management team without appropriate succession andor compensation planning could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet our objectives 

  

decreases in our ability to develop or apply new technology and knowhow may affect our competitiveness 

  

our success depends partially on our ability to improve production processes and services we must also introduce new products and services to meet changing customer needs if we are unable to implement better production processes or to develop new products through research and development or licensing of new technology we may not be able to remain competitive with other manufacturers as a result our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

adverse weather and climate changes may result in lower sales 

  

we manufacture packaging products primarily for beverages unseasonably cool weather can reduce demand for certain beverages packaged in our containers climate change could have various effects on the demand for our products and the costs of inputs to our production in different regions around the world 

  

 

we are vulnerable to fluctuations in the supply and price of raw materials 

  

we purchase aluminum steel and other raw materials and packaging supplies from several sources while all such materials are available from independent suppliers raw materials are subject to fluctuations in price and availability attributable to a number of factors including general economic conditions commodity price fluctuations particularly aluminum on the london metal exchange the demand by other industries for the same raw materials and the availability of complementary and substitute materials although we enter into commodities purchase agreements from time to time and sometimes use derivative instruments to seek to manage our risk we cannot ensure that our current suppliers of raw materials will be able to supply us with sufficient quantities at reasonable prices economic operational and financial factors as well as governmental action could impact our suppliers thereby causing supply shortages increases in raw material costs including potential increases due to tariffs sanctions or other trade actions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in the americas europe and asia some contracts do not allow us to pass along increased raw material costs and we generally use derivative agreements to seek to manage this risk our hedging procedures may be insufficient and our results could be materially impacted if costs of materials increase due to the fixedprice contracts and derivative activities while increasing raw material costs may not impact our nearterm profitability increased prices could decrease our sales volume over time 

  

prolonged work stoppages at facilities with union employees could jeopardize our financial position 

  

as of december 31 2018 14 percent of our north american packaging facility employees and 56 percent of our european employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements these collective bargaining agreements have staggered expirations during the next several years although we consider our employee relations to be generally good a prolonged work stoppage or strike at any facility with union employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition we cannot ensure that upon the expiration of existing collective bargaining agreements new agreements will be reached without union action or that any such new agreements will be on terms satisfactory to us 

  

our aerospace segment is subject to certain risks specific to that business 

  

in our aerospace business us government contracts are subject to reduction or modification in the event of changes in requirements and the government may also terminate contracts at its convenience pursuant to standard termination provisions in such instances ball may be entitled to reimbursement for allowable costs and profits on authorized work that has been performed through the date of termination 

  

in addition budgetary constraints and government shutdowns may result in further reductions to projected spending levels by the us government in particular government expenditures are subject to the potential for automatic reductions generally referred to as “sequestration” sequestration may occur in any given year resulting in significant additional reductions to spending by various us government defense and aerospace agencies on both existing and new contracts as well as the disruption of ongoing programs even if sequestration does not occur we expect that budgetary constraints and ongoing concerns regarding the us national debt will continue to place downward pressure on agency spending levels due to these and other factors overall spending on various programs could decline which could result in significant reductions to revenue cash flows net earnings and backlog primarily in our aerospace segment 

  

we use estimates in accounting for many of our programs in our aerospace business and changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results 

  

we account for sales and profits on a portion of longterm contracts in our aerospace business in accordance with the percentageofcompletion method of accounting using the costtocost method to account for updates in estimates the percentageofcompletion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project revenues and costs at completion and various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events including the quantity and timing of product deliveries future labor performance and rates and material and overhead costs these assumptions involve various levels of expected performance improvements under the costtocost method the impact of updates in our estimates related to units shipped to date or progress made to date is recognized immediately 

  

because of the significance of the judgments and estimates described above it is likely that we could record materially different amounts if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances or estimates were to change 

  

 

our backlog includes both costtype and fixedprice contracts costtype contracts generally have lower profit margins than fixedprice contracts our earnings and margins may vary depending on the types of government contracts undertaken the nature of the work performed under those contracts the costs incurred in performing the work the achievement of other performance objectives and their impact on our ability to receive fees the fixedprice contracts could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate 

  

as a us government contractor we could be adversely affected by changes in regulations or any negative findings from a us government audit or investigation 

  

our aerospace business operates in a highly regulated environment and is routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its agencies such as the defense contract audit agency dcaa and defense contract management agency dcma these agencies review performance under our contracts our cost structure and our compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies business systems that are subject to review under the dod federal acquisition regulation supplement dfars are purchasing estimating material management and accounting as well as property and earned value management any costs ultimately found to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if already reimbursed if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties sanctions or suspension or debarment from doing business with the us government whether or not illegal activities are alleged the us government also has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate if such actions were to result in suspension or debarment this could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

our business is subject to substantial environmental remediation and compliance costs 

  

our operations are subject to federal state provincial and local laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions relating to environmental hazards such as emissions to air discharges to water the handling and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes and the cleanup of hazardous substances we have been designated along with numerous other companies as a potentially responsible party for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites based on available information we do not believe that any costs incurred in connection with such sites will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations capital expenditures or competitive position there is increased focus on the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental issues worldwide 

  

our business faces the potential of increased regulation on some of the raw materials utilized in our packaging operations 

  

our operations are subject to federal state provincial and local laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions relating to some of the raw materials such as epoxybased coatings utilized in our container making process epoxybased coatings may contain bisphenola bpa scientific evidence evaluated by regulatory agencies in the us canada europe japan australia and new zealand has consistently shown these coatings to be safe for food contact at current levels and these regulatory agencies have stated that human exposure to bpa from epoxybased container coatings is well below safe exposure limits set by government bodies worldwide a significant change in these regulatory agency statements adverse information concerning bpa or rulings made within certain federal state provincial and local jurisdictions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations ball recognizes that significant interest exists in nonepoxy based coatings and we have been proactively working with coatings suppliers and our customers to transition to alternative coatings 

  

 

net earnings and net assets could be materially affected by an impairment of goodwill 

  

we have a significant amount of goodwill recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2018 we are required at least annually to test the recoverability of goodwill the recoverability test of goodwill is based on the current fair value of our identified reporting units fair value measurement requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors including revenue and market growth operating cash flows and discount rates if general market conditions deteriorate in portions of our business we could experience a significant decline in the fair value of reporting units this decline could lead to an impairment of all or a significant portion of the goodwill balance which could materially affect our us gaap net earnings and net assets 

  

we continue to see the industry supply of beverage packaging exceed demand in china resulting in significant pricing pressure and negative impacts on the profitability of our beverage packaging asia pacific reporting unit the worsening business climate in saudi arabia has resulted in negative impacts to the profitability of our beverage packaging amea reporting unit if it becomes an expectation that these situations will continue for an extended period of time it may result in a noncash impairment of some or all of the goodwill associated with these reporting units totaling 78 million and 100 million respectively at december 31 2018 the company’s annual goodwill impairment test completed in the fourth quarter of 2018 indicated the estimated fair value of the beverage packaging asia pacific and beverage packaging amea reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts including goodwill by 11 percent and 15 percent respectively the goodwill associated with the beverage packaging asia pacific reporting unit predominantly relates to the china beverage packaging facilities on december 13 2018 we announced an agreement to sell our beverage packaging facilities in china the transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2019 

  

if the investments in ball’s pension plans or in the multiemployer pension plans in which ball participates do not perform as expected we may have to contribute additional amounts to the plans which would otherwise be available for other general corporate purposes 

  

ball maintains defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of its north american employees and a significant portion of united kingdom employees which are funded based on certain actuarial assumptions the plans’ assets consist primarily of common stocks fixedincome securities and in the us alternative investments market declines longevity increases or legislative changes such as the pension protection act in the us could result in a prospective decrease in our available cash flow and net earnings over time and the recognition of an increase in our pension obligations could result in a reduction to our shareholders’ equity additional risks exist related to the company’s participation in multiemployer pension plans assets contributed to a multiemployer pension plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers if a participating employer in a multiemployer pension plan stops contributing to the plan the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participants this could result in increases to our contributions to the plans as well as pension expense 

  

restricted access to capital markets could adversely affect our shortterm liquidity and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the notes issued pursuant to our bond indentures 

  

a reduction in global market liquidity could 

  











  

as market interest rates increase our variablerate debt will create higher debt service requirements which adversely affects our cash flow while we sometimes enter into agreements limiting our exposure any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk 

  

 

the global credit financial and economic environment could have a negative impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

the overall credit financial and economic environment could have significant negative effects on our operations including 

  









  

changes in us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap and sec rules and regulations could materially impact our reported results 

  

us gaap and sec accounting and reporting changes are common and have become more frequent and significant over the past several years these changes could have significant effects on our reported results when compared to prior periods and other companies and may even require us to retrospectively adjust prior periods additionally material changes to the presentation of transactions in the consolidated financial statements could impact key ratios that analysts and credit rating agencies use to rate ball and ultimately impact our ability to access the credit markets in an efficient manner 

  

earnings and cash flows can be impacted by changes in tax laws 

  

as a usbased multinational business the company is subject to income tax in the us and numerous jurisdictions outside the us the relevant tax rules and regulations are complex often changing and in some cases are interdependent if these or other tax rules and regulations should change the company’s earnings and cash flows could be impacted 

  

in particular the us tax cuts and jobs act the act which was signed into law on december 22 2017 may continue to result in fluctuations in the company’s net earnings and cash flows the act introduced major changes to us income tax law that require significant judgment to interpret the impact of the provisions of the act on the company’s financial results 

  

due to the timing of its enactment and the complexity associated with the provisions of the act the company made reasonable estimates of its effects where possible and recorded provisional estimates in its financial statements for the year ended december 31 2017 the company has updated these provisional estimates as needed and its financial statements now reflect the final impact of these items based on currently available guidance including proposed regulations given the various uncertainties and ambiguities that still remain with respect to the application of the act the internal revenue service and the us treasury department may issue subsequent guidance on the provisions of the act including final regulations that differs from our current interpretations the impact of any adjustments required as a result of such subsequent guidance could materially affect the company’s financial results 

  

the company’s worldwide provision for income taxes is determined in part through the use of significant estimates and judgments numerous transactions arise in the ordinary course of business where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain the company undergoes tax examinations by various worldwide tax authorities on a regular basis while the company believes its estimates of its tax obligations are reasonable the final outcome after the conclusion of any tax examinations and any litigation could be materially different from what has been reflected in the company’s historical financial statements 

  

 

increased information technology it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems networks products solutions and services 

  

the company’s it systems or any third party’s system on which the company relies could fail on their own accord or may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions or shutdowns including interruptions or shutdowns due to natural disasters power outages or telecommunications failures terrorist attacks or failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software or hardware increased global it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime also pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data as a provider of products and services to government and commercial customers our aerospace business in particular may be the target of cyberattacks including attempts to gain unauthorized access to classified or sensitive information and networks the company has a number of shared service centers where many of the company’s it systems are concentrated and any disruption at such a location could impact the company’s business within the operating zones served by the impacted service center 

  

while we attempt to mitigate all of these risks by employing a number of measures including employee training comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems networks products solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats or other it disruptions depending on their nature and scope such threats could potentially lead to the compromise of confidential information improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data defective products harm to individuals or property contractual or regulatory actions and fines penalties and potential liabilities production downtimes and operational disruptions which in turn could adversely affect our reputation competitiveness and results of operations data privacy and protection laws are evolving and present increasing compliance challenges which may increase our costs affect our competitiveness and could expose us to substantial fines or other penalties in addition a security breach that involves classified or other sensitive government information could subject us to civil or criminal penalties and could result in the loss of our secure facility clearance and other accreditation loss of our government contracts loss of access to classified information or debarment as a government contractor 

  

a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could if not remediated result in material misstatements in our financial statements 

  

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act a material weakness is defined as a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis if a material weakness is identified management could conclude that internal control over financial reporting is not effective based on criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organization of the treadway commission in “ internal control—an integrated framework 2013” if a material weakness is identified a remediation plan would be designed to address the material weakness if remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weakness or if additional material weaknesses in internal control are discovered or occur in the future our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results as of december 31 2018 the company had no material weaknesses 

  

significant developments stemming from the uk’s referendum on membership in the eu could have a material adverse effect on us 

  

in june 2016 the uk held a referendum and voted in favor of leaving the european union eu this referendum has created political and economic uncertainty particularly in the uk and the eu and this uncertainty may last for years particularly as the uk and the eu continue to negotiate the terms of withdrawal from the eu our business in the uk the eu and worldwide could be affected by uncertainty prior to and after the upcoming march 29 2019 withdrawal date by the impact of the uk’s referendum and anticipated withdrawal from the eu there are many ways in which our business could be affected only some of which we can identify at the present time such as supply chain constraints increased material costs due to rising tariffs effects on employee mobility and increased costs of doing business in the uk these effects could be more severe if the uk and the eu fail to reach an agreement prior to the withdrawal date 

  

 

the referendum and the likely withdrawal of the uk from the eu it triggers has caused and along with events that could occur in the future as a consequence of the uk’s withdrawal including the possible breakup of the uk or the eu may continue to cause significant volatility in global financial markets including in global currency and debt markets a failure by the uk and the eu to reach an agreement prior to the uk’s departure from the eu scheduled for march 29 2019 may increase this volatility this volatility could cause a slowdown in economic activity in the uk europe or globally which could adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects in addition our business could be negatively affected by new trade agreements between the uk and other countries including the us and by the possible imposition of trade or other regulatory barriers in the uk these possible negative impacts and others resulting from the uk ’ s actual or threatened withdrawal from the eu may adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

management’s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k annual report which include additional information about our accounting policies practices and the transactions underlying our financial results the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes including various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits taxes environmental and other matters arising during the normal course of business we apply our best judgment our knowledge of existing facts and circumstances and actions that we may undertake in the future in determining the estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances such as current economic conditions and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change as future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision actual results may differ from these estimates ball corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as “ball corporation” “ball” “the company” “we” or “our” in the following discussion and analysis 

  

overview 

  

business overview and industry trends 

  

ball corporation is one of the world’s leading suppliers of metal packaging to the beverage personal care and household products industries our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses are manufactured in facilities around the world and are competitive with other substrates such as plastics and glass in the rigid packaging industry sales and earnings can be increased by reducing costs increasing prices developing new products expanding volumes and making strategic acquisitions we also provide aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers including national defense hardware antenna and video tactical solutions civil and operational space hardware and system engineering services 

  

we sell our packaging products mainly to large multinational beverage personal care and household products companies with which we have developed longterm relationships this is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of longterm supply contracts while we have a diversified customer base we sell a significant portion of our packaging products to major companies and brands as well as to numerous regional customers the overall global beverage and aerosol metal container industries are growing and are expected to continue to grow in the medium to long term the primary customers for the products and services provided by our aerospace segment are us government agencies or their prime contractors 

  

we purchase our raw materials from relatively few suppliers we also have exposure to inflation in particular the rising costs of raw materials as well as other direct cost inputs we mitigate our exposure to the changes in the costs of metal through the inclusion of provisions in contracts covering the majority of our volumes to pass through metal price changes as well as through the use of derivative instruments the passthrough provisions generally result in proportional increases or decreases in sales and costs with a greatly reduced impact if any on net earnings because of our customer and supplier concentration our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss insolvency or bankruptcy of a major customer or supplier or a change in a supply agreement with a major customer or supplier although our contract provisions generally mitigate the risk of customer loss and our longterm relationships represent a known stable customer base 

  

the majority of the aerospace business involves work under contracts generally from one to five years in duration as a prime contractor or subcontractor for various us government agencies intense competition and long operating cycles are key characteristics of the company’s aerospace and defense industry where it is common for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to a competitor become a subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting company 

  

 

corporate strategy 

  

our drive for 10 vision encompasses five strategic levers that are key to growing our business and achieving longterm success since launching drive for 10 in 2011 we have made progress on each of the levers as follows 

  



  



  



  



  



  

these ongoing business developments and our successful acquisition of rexam in 2016 help us stay close to our customers while expanding andor sustaining our industry positions and global reach with major beverage personal care household products and aerospace customers 

  

results of operations 

  

management’s discussion and analysis for our results of operations on a consolidated and segment basis include a quantification of factors that had a material impact other factors that did not have a material impact but that are significant to understand the results are qualitatively described 

  

consolidated sales and earnings 

  



  

sales in 2018 were 652 million higher compared to 2017 primarily as a result of increased sales volumes for our south america and europe segments pass through of higher metal prices higher pricing and favorable product mix for our north and central america segment favorable foreign exchange rate changes in our europe segment and increased sales in the aerospace segment driven by significant us national defense contracts 

  

 

net earnings attributable to ball corporation in 2018 were 80 million higher than 2017 primarily due to increased sales volumes in our europe and north and central america segments favorable manufacturing performance and lower business consolidation and other costs partially offset by higher tax expense freight costs and interest expense 

  

sales and operating earnings for 2018 were impacted by the loss of sales from our us steel food and steel aerosol business which was sold on july 31 2018 

  

sales in 2017 were 19 billion higher compared to 2016 primarily as a result of increased sales volumes for our north and central america south america and europe segments increased pass through of higher metal prices for our north and central america and south america segments favorable currency exchange effects for our europe segment favorable product mix for our south america segment and increased sales in our aerospace segment sales volumes for the year ended december 31 2017 for our north and central america south america and europe segments were higher compared to the same period in 2016 primarily as a result of 2017 including twelve months of sales volumes from the acquired rexam business while 2016 included six months of sales volumes from the acquired rexam business and six months of sales volumes from the company’s legacy business a significant portion of which was sold in connection with the june 2016 acquisition of rexam divestment business the south america segment experienced organic sales growth and increased sales from significant us national defense contracts drove revenue growth in the aerospace segment 

  

net earnings attributable to ball corporation in 2017 were 111 million higher than 2016 primarily due to increased earnings related to higher sales volumes in the south america europe and north and central america beverage can segments synergy realizations lower cost of sales in 2017 compared to 2016 which included 84 million for the stepup of inventory related to the acquired rexam business lower debt refinancing and other costs in 2017 and a decrease in business consolidation and other activities in 2017 partially offset by higher incremental depreciation these impacts on net earnings were partially offset by higher tax expense in 2017 due principally to provisional charges from the us tax cuts and jobs act which was signed into law on december 22 2017 income tax benefits in 2016 associated with the restructure of brazil legal entities as a result of the sale of the divestment business the tax benefit on transaction costs and derivative costs of the rexam acquisition and sale of the divestment business in 2016 

  

debt refinancing and other costs in 2016 included costs on debt associated with the rexam acquisition see note 15 located in item 8 of this annual report for additional information on the activity in debt refinancing and other costs 

  

cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization 

  

cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization was 9329 million in 2018 compared to 8717 million in 2017 and 7296 million in 2016 these amounts represented 80 percent 79 percent and 81 percent of consolidated net sales for the years ended 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively cost of sales in 2016 included expense of 84 million for the stepup of inventory related to the acquired rexam business 

  

depreciation and amortization 

  

depreciation and amortization expense was 702 million in 2018 compared to 729 million in 2017 and 453 million in 2016 these amounts represented 6 percent 7 percent and 5 percent of consolidated net sales for 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively the expense was lower in 2018 compared to 2017 due to the absence of catchup depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets following the rexam acquisition which was recorded during 2017 the expense was higher in 2017 compared to 2016 due to increased depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets related to 2016 following the rexam acquisition during 2017 the company finalized the valuation and useful lives of the assets acquired in the rexam acquisition as a result depreciation and amortization expense for 2017 included a cumulative catchup adjustment of 35 million related to the last six months of 2016 amortization expense in 2018 2017 and 2016 included 164 million 162 million and 65 million respectively for the amortization of acquired rexam intangibles 

  

 

selling general and administrative 

  

selling general and administrative sga expenses were 478 million in 2018 compared to 514 million in 2017 and 512 million in 2016 these amounts represented 4 percent 5 percent and 6 percent of consolidated net sales for those three years respectively contributing to the lower sga expenses in 2018 were reduced employee compensation costs favorable currency exchange rate effects lower costs due to office closures and other costout initiatives implemented by the company in relation to the acquired rexam business the lower percentage of sga expense in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to office closures and various other costout initiatives implemented by the company in relation to the acquired rexam business and the lack of foreign exchange losses of 27 million for the devaluation of the egyptian pound in the fourth quarter of 2016 

  

business consolidation costs and other activities 

  

business consolidation and other activities were 191 million in 2018 compared to 221 million in 2017 and 337 million in 2016 these amounts represented 2 percent 2 percent and 4 percent of consolidated net sales for the three years respectively 

  

the yearoveryear decrease in business consolidation and other activities in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to lower severance and facility shut down costs lower costs related to lower settlement charges related to certain ball us defined pension plans a gain on brazilian indirect taxes and a gain on the sale of our former chatsworth california beverage packing facility partially offset by the loss on sale of the us steel food and steel aerosol business see note 6 located in item 8 of this annual report for additional information on the activity in business consolidation and other activities 

  

the yearoveryear decrease in business consolidation and other activities in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to a decrease of 322 million in rexam transaction related costs and 83 million of rexam acquisition related compensation arrangements and a decrease of 173 million in foreign currency exchange losses associated with the rexam transaction these impacts were partially offset by a decrease of 289 million in the gain recognized in connection with the sale of the ball portion of the divestment business an increase of 99 million related to completed and pending plant closures an increase of 44 million related to the settlement of certain ball us defined benefit pension plans and an increase of 34 million for indemnification of certain tax matters provided to the buyer in the sale of the divestment business see note 6 located in item 8 of this annual report for additional information on the activity in business consolidation and other activities 

  

interest expense 

  

total interest expense was 302 million in 2018 compared to 288 million in 2017 and 338 million in 2016 excluding debt refinancing and other costs interest expense in 2018 was higher than in 2017 due to higher interest rates partially offset by lower average debt interest expense was higher in 2017 as compared to 2016 as the average level of debt held was higher than the period preceding it interest expense excluding the effect of debt refinancing and other costs as a percentage of average monthly borrowings was 4 percent in each of the years 2018 2017 and 2016 

  

debt refinancing and other costs were 1 million for the year ended december 31 2018 3 million for the year ended december 31 2017 and 109 million for the year ended december 31 2016 the amount for the year ended 2016 consisted mainly of costs incurred to fund the rexam acquisition see notes 15 and 21 in item 8 of this annual report for additional information on these instruments and the transactions flowing through debt refinancing and other costs

aerospace 

  



  

the aerospace segment consists of the manufacture and sale of aerospace and other related products and services provided for the defense civil space and commercial space industries 

  

segment sales in 2018 were 205 million higher compared to 2017 and comparable operating earnings were 15 million higher the increase in sales and operating earnings for 2018 was primarily the result of increases from significant us national defense contracts 

  

segment sales in 2017 were 173 million higher compared to 2016 and comparable operating earnings were 10 million higher the increase in sales and operating earnings for 2017 was primarily the result of increases from significant us national defense contracts 

  

sales to the us government either directly as a prime contractor or indirectly as a subcontractor represented 99 percent of segment sales in 2018 compared to 98 percent of segment sales in 2017 and 97 percent in 2016 the aerospace contract mix in 2018 consisted of 67 percent costtype contracts which are billed at our costs plus an agreed upon andor earned profit component and 30 percent fixedprice contracts the remaining sales were for time and materials contracts 

  

 

contracted backlog for the aerospace segment at december 31 2018 and 2017 was 22 billion and 175 billion respectively the yearoveryear increase reflects several major contract awards during 2018 the segment has numerous outstanding bids for future contract awards the backlog at december 31 2018 consisted of 70 percent costtype contracts comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations due to the nature of varying delivery and milestone schedules on contracts funding of programs and the uncertainty of timing of future contract awards 

  

additional segment information 

  

for additional information regarding our segments see the business segment information in note 3 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report the charges recorded for business consolidation and other activities were based on estimates by ball management and were developed from information available at the time if actual outcomes vary from the estimates the differences will be reflected in current period earnings in the consolidated statement of earnings and identified as business consolidation gains and losses additional details about our business consolidation and other activities are provided in note 6 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

  

management performance measures 

  

management internally uses various measures to evaluate company performance such as comparable operating earnings earnings before interest taxes and business consolidation and other noncomparable costs comparable net earnings earnings before business consolidation costs and other noncomparable costs after tax return on average invested capital net operating earnings after tax over the relevant performance period divided by average invested capital over the same period economic value added eva® dollars net operating earnings after tax less a capital charge on average invested capital employed earnings before interest and taxes ebit earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda and diluted earnings per share management also uses free cash flow generally defined by the company as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures as a measure to evaluate the company’s liquidity we believe this information is also useful to investors as it provides insight into the earnings and cash flow criteria management uses to make strategic decisions these financial measures may be adjusted at times for items that affect comparability between periods such as business consolidation costs and gains or losses on acquisitions and dispositions 

  

nonfinancial measures in the packaging businesses include production efficiency and spoilage rates quality control figures environmental health and safety statistics production and sales volumes asset utilization rates and measures of sustainability additional measures used to evaluate financial performance in the aerospace segment include contract revenue realization award and incentive fees realized proposal win rates and backlog including awarded contracted and funded backlog 

  

many of the above noted financial measurements are on a nonus gaap basis and should be considered in connection with the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report nonus gaap measures should not be considered in isolation and should not be considered superior to or a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with us gaap a presentation of earnings in accordance with us gaap is available in item 8 of this annual report 

  

based on the above definitions our calculations of comparable operating earnings and comparable net earnings are summarized in the tables included within item 6 of this annual report on form 10k   

  

critical and significant accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements 

  

for information regarding the company’s critical and significant accounting policies as well as recent accounting pronouncements see notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

  

 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

  

cash flows and capital expenditures 

  

our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities and external committed borrowings we believe that cash flows from operations and cash provided by shortterm longterm and committed revolver borrowings when necessary will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements scheduled principal and interest payments on debt dividend payments and anticipated capital expenditures the following table summarizes our cash flows 

  





  

cash flows provided by operations were higher in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to higher earnings and lower pension contributions partially offset by lower working capital inflows excluding the impact of the new revenue recognition standard and the sale of the us steel food and steel aerosol packaging business the impact of a reduction of days sales outstanding from 45 to 32 days a reduction of inventory days on hand from 61 to 58 days and an increase in days payable outstanding from 110 to 112 days was partially offset by increases in other receivables 

  

cash flows from operations in 2017 were higher compared to 2016 primarily due to improved earnings and working capital working capital changes in 2017 included a decrease in inventory days on hand from 68 to 61 days a decrease in days sales outstanding from 46 to 45 days and an increase in days payable outstanding from 97 to 110 days the continuing increase in days payable outstanding is a result of longer negotiated contractual terms with suppliers 

  

we have entered into several regional committed and uncommitted accounts receivable factoring programs with various financial institutions for certain of our accounts receivable programs accounted for as true sales of the receivables without recourse to ball had combined limits of approximately 12 billion and 10 billion at december 31 2018 and december 31 2017 respectively a total of 178 million and 439 million were available for sale under these programs at december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively 

  

as of december 31 2018 approximately 717 million of our cash was held outside of the us in the event that we would need to utilize any of the cash held outside of the us for purposes within the us there are no material legal or other economic restrictions regarding the repatriation of cash from any of the countries outside the us where we have cash other than market liquidity constraints that limit the ability to convert egyptian pounds held by the company in egypt with a us dollar equivalent value of 56 million into other currencies the company believes its us operating cash flows as well as availability under its longterm revolving credit facilities uncommitted shortterm credit facilities and committed and uncommitted accounts receivable factoring programs will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of the us portion of our ongoing operations scheduled principal and interest payments on us debt dividend payments capital expenditures and other us cash requirements if foreign funds would be needed for our us cash requirements and we are unable to provide the funds through intercompany financing arrangements we would be required to repatriate funds from foreign locations where the company has previously asserted indefinite reinvestment of funds outside the us 

  

 

due to the us tax status of certain ball subsidiaries in canada and the prc the company annually provides us taxes on foreign earnings in those subsidiaries net of any estimated foreign tax credits or deductions for foreign taxes current taxes are also provided on certain other undistributed earnings that are currently taxable in the us management’s intention is to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of ball’s other foreign subsidiaries the indefinite reinvestment assertion is supported by both longterm and shortterm forecasts and us financial requirements including but not limited to operating cash flows capital expenditures debt maturities and dividends as a result the company has not provided deferred taxes on earnings in certain nonus subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in its international operations retained earnings in nonus subsidiaries were 32 billion as of december 31 2018 although 20 billion of such earnings have been subjected to us federal income tax incremental foreign and us state income tax may be due upon distribution at present it is not practical to estimate the additional taxes that may become payable upon the eventual remittance of these foreign earnings to the us however repatriation of these earnings could result in a material increase in the company’s effective tax rate 

  

share repurchases 

  

the company’s share repurchases net of issuances totaled 711 million in 2018 76 million in 2017 and 59 million in 2016 the repurchases were completed using cash on hand and available borrowings additional details about our share repurchase activities are provided in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

  

debt facilities and refinancing 

  

given our cash flow projections and unused credit facilities that are available until 2021 our liquidity is strong and is expected to meet our ongoing cash and debt service requirements total interestbearing debt was 67 billion at december 31 2018 compared to 70 billion at december 31 2017 

  

in march 2018 ball issued 750 million of 4875 percent senior notes and used the proceeds to repay 315 million of its term a loan as well as outstanding multicurrency revolver and shortterm credit facility borrowings 

  

at december 31 2018 taking into account outstanding letters of credit approximately 15 billion was available under the company’s longterm multicurrency committed revolving credit facilities which are available until march 2021 in addition to these facilities the company had 1billion of shortterm uncommitted credit facilities available at december 31 2018 of which 211 million was outstanding and due on demand at december 31 2017 the company had 340 million outstanding under shortterm uncommitted credit facilities 

  

while ongoing financial and economic conditions in certain areas may raise concerns about credit risk with counterparties to derivative transactions the company mitigates its exposure by allocating the risk among various counterparties and limiting exposure to any one party we also monitor the credit ratings of our suppliers customers lenders and counterparties on a regular basis 

  

we were in compliance with all loan agreements at december 31 2018 and for all prior years presented and have met all debt payment obligations the us note agreements and bank credit agreement contain certain restrictions relating to dividends investments financial ratios guarantees and the incurrence of additional indebtedness the most restrictive of the company’s debt covenants requires the company to maintain a leverage ratio as defined of no greater than 425 times at december 31 2018 the company was in compliance with all loan agreements and debt covenants at december 31 2018 and 2017 and we have met all debt payment obligations as of december 31 2018 approximately 17 billion of the amounts disclosed as available under the company’s longterm multicurrency committed revolving facilities and shortterm uncommitted credit facilities are available without violating our existing debt covenants additional details about our debt are available in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

  

 

other liquidity measures 

  

free cash flow 

  

management internally uses a free cash flow measure to 1 evaluate the company’s liquidity 2 evaluate strategic investments 3 plan stock buyback and dividend levels and 4 evaluate the company’s ability to incur and service debt free cash flow is not a defined term under us gaap and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures the company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures free cash flow is typically derived directly from the company’s consolidated statement of cash flows however it may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods 

  

based on the above definition our consolidated free cash flow is summarized as follows 

  





  

based on information currently available we estimate cash flows from operating activities for 2019 to be in excess of 16 billion capital expenditures to be approximately 600 million and free cash flow to exceed 1 billion in 2019 we intend to utilize our operating cash flow to service debt and to fund our growth capital projects dividend payments stock buybacks and to the extent available acquisitions that meet our criteria of the total 2019 estimated capital expenditures approximately 250 million was contractually committed as of december 31 2018 

  

commitments 

  

cash payments required for longterm debt maturities rental payments under noncancellable operating leases purchase obligations and other commitments in effect at december 31 2018 are summarized in the following table 

  







c for variable rate facilities amounts are based on interest rates in effect at year end and do not contemplate the effects of any hedging instruments utilized by the company 

d the company’s purchase obligations include capital expenditures and contracted amounts for aluminum steel and other direct materials also included are commitments for purchases of natural gas and electricity expenses related to aerospace and technologies contracts and other less significant items in cases where variable prices andor usage are involved management’s best estimates have been used depending on the circumstances early termination of the contracts may or may not result in penalties and therefore actual payments could vary significantly 

  

 

the table above does not include 80 million of uncertain tax positions the timing of resolution of which is unknown at this time 

  

contributions to the company’s defined benefit pension plans are expected to be in the range of 92 million in 2019 this estimate may change based on changes in the pension protection act actual plan asset performance and available company cash flow among other factors benefit payments related to these plans are expected to be 395 million 390 million 395 million 400 million and 406 million for the years ending december 31 2019 through 2023 respectively and a total of 21 billion for the years ending december 31 2024 through 2028 

  

based on changes in return on asset and discount rate assumptions as well as revisions based on plan experience studies total pension expense in 2019 excluding settlement and curtailment losses is anticipated to be approximately 20 million lower than in 2018 a reduction of the expected return on pension assets assumption by one quarter of a percentage point would result in an estimated 13 million increase in the 2019 pension expense while a quarter of a percentage point reduction in the discount rate applied to the pension liability would result in an estimated 3 million reduction of pension expense in 2019 additional details about our defined benefit pension plans are available in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

  

contingencies 

  

the company is routinely subject to litigation incident to operating its businesses and has been designated by various federal and state environmental agencies as a potentially responsible party along with numerous other companies for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites including in respect of sites related to alleged activities of certain rexam subsidiaries the company believes the matters identified will not have a material adverse effect upon its liquidity results of operations or financial condition details of the company’s legal proceedings are included in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

financial instruments and risk management 

  

the company employs established risk management policies and procedures which seek to reduce the company’s commercial risk exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices interest rates currency exchange rates and prices of the company’s common stock with regard to common share repurchases and the company’s deferred compensation stock plan however there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be successful although the instruments utilized involve varying degrees of credit market and interest risk the counterparties to the agreements are expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements the company monitors counterparty credit risk including lenders on a regular basis but ball cannot be certain that all risks will be discerned or that its risk management policies and procedures will always be effective additionally in the event of default under the company’s master derivative agreements the nondefaulting party has the option to set off any amounts owed with regard to open derivative positions 

  

we have estimated our market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis market risk exposure has been defined as the changes in fair value of derivative instruments financial instruments and commodity positions to test the sensitivity of our market risk exposure we have estimated the changes in fair value of market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in market prices or rates the results of the sensitivity analyses are summarized below 

  

 

commodity price risk 

  

aluminum 

  

we manage commodity price risk in connection with market price fluctuations of aluminum ingot through two different methods first we enter into container sales contracts that include aluminum ingotbased pricing terms that generally reflect the same price fluctuations included in commercial purchase contracts for aluminum sheet the terms include fixed floating or passthrough aluminum ingot component pricing second we use derivative instruments such as option and forward contracts as economic and cash flow hedges of commodity price risk where there are material differences between sales and purchase contracted pricing and volume 

  

considering the effects of derivative instruments the company’s ability to pass through certain raw material costs through contractual provisions the market’s ability to accept price increases and the company’s commodity price exposures under its contract terms a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the company’s aluminum prices would result in an estimated 8 million aftertax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period additionally the company has currency exposures on raw materials and the effect of a 10 percent adverse change is included in the total currency exposure discussed below actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates 

  

interest rate risk 

  

our objective in managing exposure to interest rate changes is to minimize the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to minimize our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we may use a variety of interest rate swaps collars and options to manage our mix of floating and fixedrate debt interest rate instruments held by the company at december 31 2018 included payfixed interest rate swaps which effectively convert variable rate obligations to fixedrate instruments 

  

based on our interest rate exposure at december 31 2018 assumed floating rate debt levels throughout the next 12 months and the effects of our existing derivative instruments a 100basis point increase in interest rates would result in an estimated 2 million after tax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates and the timing of these changes 

  

currency exchange rate risk 

  

our objective in managing exposure to currency fluctuations is to limit the exposure of cash flows and earnings from changes associated with currency exchange rate changes through the use of various derivative contracts in addition at times ball manages earnings translation volatility through the use of currency option strategies and the change in the fair value of those options is recorded in the company’s net earnings our currency translation risk results from the currencies in which we transact business the company faces currency exposures in our global operations as a result of various factors including intercompany currency denominated loans selling our products in various currencies purchasing raw materials and equipment in various currencies and tax exposures not denominated in the functional currency sales contracts are negotiated with customers to reflect cost changes and where there is not an exchange passthrough arrangement the company may use forward and option contracts to manage significant currency exposures 

  

considering the company’s derivative financial instruments outstanding at december 31 2018 and the various currency exposures a hypothetical 10 percent reduction us dollar strengthening mainly against the russian ruble in currency exchange rates compared to the us dollar would result in an estimated 15 million after tax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period this hypothetical adverse change in currency exchange rates would also reduce our forecasted average debt balance by 127 million and increase our forecasted cross currency swap value by 119 million actual changes in market prices or rates may differ from hypothetical changes

our aerospace business is a leader in the design development and manufacture of innovative aerospace systems for civil commercial and national cyber security aerospace markets it produces spacecraft instruments and sensors radio frequency systems and components data exploitation solutions and a variety of advanced aerospace technologies and products that enable deep space missions 

  

we are headquartered in broomfield colorado and our stock is listed for trading on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol bll 

  

our strategy 

  

our overall business strategy is defined by our drive for 10 vision which at its highest level is a mindset around perfection with a greater sense of urgency around our future success launched in 2011 our drive for 10 vision encompasses five strategic levers that are key to growing our businesses and achieving longterm success these five levers are

our reportable segments 

  

ball corporation reports its financial performance in five reportable segments 1 beverage packaging north and central america 2 beverage packaging south america 3 beverage packaging europe 4 food and aerosol packaging and 5 aerospace ball also has investments in the us guatemala panama south korea and vietnam that are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and accordingly those results are not included in segment sales or earnings financial information related to each of our segments is included in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report on form 10k annual report 

  

beverage packaging north and central america segment 

  

beverage packaging north and central america is ball’s largest segment accounting for 38 percent of consolidated net sales in 2017 metal beverage containers are primarily sold under multiyear supply contracts to fillers of carbonated soft drinks beer energy drinks and other beverages 

  

metal beverage containers and ends are produced at 19 manufacturing facilities in the us one in canada and two in mexico additionally rocky mountain metal container llc a joint venture owned 50 percent by ball and 50 percent by a wholly owned subsidiary of molson coors brewing company operates beverage container and end manufacturing facilities in golden colorado 

  

the north american beverage container manufacturing industry is relatively mature where growth or contractions are projected in certain markets or for certain products ball undertakes selected capacity increases or decreases primarily in its existing facilities to meet market demand a meaningful portion of the industrywide reduction in demand for standard 12ounce aluminum cans for the carbonated soft drink market is being offset with growing demand for specialty container volumes from new and existing customers and consumer demand during 2016 we began production at our newly constructed beverage can and end manufacturing facility in monterrey mexico 

  

according to publicly available information and company estimates the north america beverage container industry represents approximately 110 billion units five companies manufacture substantially all of the metal beverage containers in the us canada and mexico ball produced approximately 46 billion recyclable aluminum beverage containers in north america in 2017 which represented approximately 40 percent of the aggregate production in these countries historically sales volumes of metal beverage containers in north america tend to be highest during the period from april through september all of the beverage containers produced by ball in the us canada and mexico are made of aluminum in north and central america five suppliers provide the majority of our aluminum can and end sheet requirements  

  

beverage containers are sold based on price quality service innovation and sustainability in a highly competitive market which is relatively capital intensive and characterized by facilities that run more or less continuously in order to operate profitably in addition the metal beverage container competes aggressively with other packaging materials which include meaningful industry positions by the glass bottle in the packaged beer industry and the polyethylene terephthalate pet bottle in the carbonated soft drink and water industries 

  

we believe we have limited our exposure to changes in the cost of aluminum ingot as a result of the inclusion of provisions in most metal beverage container sales contracts to pass through aluminum price changes as well as through the use of derivative instruments 

  

in order to better align our manufacturing footprint to meet the needs of our customers the company announced in july 2015 the closure of its bristol virginia beverage endmaking facility the bristol facility which ceased production at the end of june 2016 produced beverage ends in a variety of sizes and its capacity was transitioned to existing north american ball endmaking facilities in december 2016 the company announced the closure of its reidsville north carolina beverage packaging plant the reidsville facility which ceased production at the end of june 2017 produced beverage cans in a variety of sizes and its customers are now supplied by the company’s other us facilities during the third quarter of 2017 the company announced the closure of its beverage can manufacturing facilities in chatsworth california and longview texas and its beverage end manufacturing facility in birmingham alabama the birmingham plant is currently expected to cease production by the end of the second quarter of 2018 and the longview 

 

and chatsworth plants are currently expected to cease production by the end of the third quarter of 2018 the capacity from these locations will be transitioned to other north american ball facilities in order to serve growing customer demand for specialty cans in the southwestern us the company is constructing a beverage packaging facility in goodyear arizona which is expected to begin production in the second quarter of 2018 

  

beverage packaging south america segment 

  

the beverage packaging south america segment accounted for 15 percent of ball’s consolidated net sales in 2017 our operations consist of 14 facilities 12 in brazil and one each in argentina and chile for the countries where we operate the south american beverage container market is approximately 29 billion containers and we are the largest producer in this region with an estimated 55 percent of south american shipments in 2017 four companies currently manufacture substantially all of the metal beverage containers in brazil 

  

the company’s south american beverage facilities produced approximately 16 billion aluminum beverage containers in 2017 historically sales volumes of beverage containers in south america tend to be highest during the period from september through december in south america two suppliers provide virtually all our aluminum sheet requirements 

  

in order to support contracted volumes for aluminum beverage packaging across paraguay argentina and bolivia the company will construct a oneline beverage can and end manufacturing plant in paraguay and will add capacity to its buenos aires argentina facility the paraguay plant is expected to begin production in the fourth quarter of 2019 

  

we believe we have limited our exposure to changes in the costs of aluminum ingot as a result of the inclusion of provisions in most metal beverage container sales contracts to pass through aluminum ingot price changes as well as through the use of derivative instruments 

  

beverage packaging europe segment 

  

the beverage packaging europe segment which accounted for 21 percent of ball’s consolidated net sales in 2017 our european operations consist of 20 facilities throughout europe the european beverage container market is approximately 64 billion containers including russia and we are the largest producer with an estimated 42 percent of european shipments the european market is highly regional in terms of sales growth rates and packaging mix four companies manufacture substantially all of the metal beverage containers in europe our european beverage facilities produced 27 billion beverage containers in 2017 the vast majority of which were produced from aluminum 

  

historically sales volumes of metal beverage containers in europe tend to be highest during the period from may through august with a smaller increase in demand leading up to the winter holiday season in the uk offset by much lower demand in russia much like other parts of the world the metal beverage container competes aggressively with other packaging materials used by the european beer and carbonated soft drink industries the glass bottle is heavily utilized in the packaged beer industry while the pet container is utilized in the carbonated soft drink beer juice and water industries 

  

european raw material supply contracts generally have longer term agreements in europe five aluminum suppliers and two steel suppliers provide almost all of our requirements aluminum is traded primarily in us dollars while the functional currencies of our european operations are various other currencies the company minimizes its exchange rate risk using derivative and supply contracts in local currencies purchase and sales contracts generally include fixedprice floating or passthrough aluminum ingot component pricing arrangements 

  

in order to support strong growth for beverage cans in the iberian peninsula the company is constructing a twoline aluminum beverage can manufacturing facility near madrid spain with the majority of the new capacity secured under a longterm customer contract the facility is expected to be fully operational in mid2018 and will produce multiple can sizes in the third quarter of 2017 our beverage packaging container and end production facilities in recklinghausen germany ceased production and the capacity was transitioned to existing european ball facilities 

  

food and aerosol packaging segment 

  

the food and aerosol packaging segment accounted for 10 percent of consolidated net sales in 2017 ball produces twopiece and threepiece steel food containers and ends for packaging vegetables fruit soups meat seafood nutritional products pet food and other products the segment also manufactures and sells steel aerosol containers as well as 

 

extruded aluminum aerosol containers and aluminum slugs there are 10 facilities in the us four in europe two in argentina one in canada one in mexico and one in india that manufacture these products 

  

we estimate our steel aerosol business accounted for 34 percent of total annual us and canadian steel aerosol shipments in 2017 in the us and canada we are the leading supplier of aluminum slugs used in the production of extruded aluminum aerosol containers and estimate our percentage of the total industry shipments to be 77 percent we estimate our extruded aluminum aerosol business accounted for 21 percent of total annual north american extruded aluminum aerosol shipments in 2017 ball’s european aluminum aerosol shipments represented 20 percent of total european industry shipments in 2017 historically sales volumes of metal food containers in north america tend to be highest from may through october as a result of seasonal fruit vegetable and salmon packs we estimate our 2017 shipments of 3 billion steel food containers to be 11 percent of total us and canadian metal food container shipments 

  

cost containment and maximizing asset utilization are crucial to maintaining profitability in the metal food and aerosol container manufacturing industries and ball is focused on doing so during the first quarter of 2016 the company announced the closure of its food and aerosol packaging flat sheet production and endmaking facility in weirton west virginia which ceased production in the first quarter of 2017 and its production capacity was consolidated into other ball facilities in the us in october 2016 the company sold its specialty tin manufacturing facility in baltimore maryland in march 2017 the company sold its paint and general line can plant in hubbard ohio 

  

competition in the us steel aerosol container market primarily includes three other national suppliers competitors in the metal food container industry include three national and a small number of regional suppliers and selfmanufacturers several producers in mexico also manufacture steel food containers steel containers also compete with other packaging materials in the food and aerosol products industry including glass aluminum plastic paper and pouches as a result profitability for this product line is dependent on price cost reduction service and quality two steel suppliers provide approximately 58 percent of our tinplate steel we believe we have limited our exposure related to changes in the costs of steel tinplate and aluminum as a result of the inclusion of provisions in many sales contracts to pass through steel and aluminum cost changes and the existence of certain other steel container sales contracts that incorporate annually negotiated metal costs we also mitigate aluminum cost changes through our selfsupply of aluminum slugs and the use of aluminum scrap from our beverage can facilities 

  

aerospace segment 

  

ball’s aerospace segment which accounted for 9 percent of consolidated net sales in 2017 includes national defense hardware antenna and video tactical solutions civil and operational space hardware and systems engineering services the segment develops spacecraft sensors and instruments radio frequency systems and other advanced technologies for the civil commercial and national security aerospace markets the majority of the aerospace business involves work under contracts generally from one to five years in duration as a prime contractor or subcontractor for the us department of defense dod the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and other us government agencies the company competes against both large and small prime contractors and subcontractors for these contracts contracts funded by the various agencies of the federal government represented 98 percent of segment sales in 2017 

  

intense competition and long operating cycles are key characteristics of both the company’s business and the aerospace and defense industry it is common in the aerospace and defense industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to a competitor become a subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting company it is not unusual to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or a customer of that same competitor on other contracts or vice versa 

  

geopolitical events and shifting executive and legislative branch priorities have resulted in an increase in opportunities over the past decade in areas matching our aerospace segment’s core capabilities in space hardware the businesses include hardware and services sold primarily to us customers with emphasis on space science and exploration environmental and earth sciences and defense and intelligence applications major activities frequently involve the design manufacture and testing of satellites remote sensors and ground station control hardware and software as well as related services such as launch vehicle integration and satellite operations 

  

other hardware activities include target identification warning and attitude control systems and components cryogenic systems for reactant storage and associated sensor cooling devices star trackers which are generalpurpose stellar attitude sensors and faststeering mirrors additionally the aerospace segment provides diversified technical services 

 

and products to government agencies prime contractors and commercial organizations for a broad range of information warfare electronic warfare avionics intelligence training and space system needs 

  

contracted backlog in the aerospace segment was 175 billion and 14 billion at december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively and consisted of the aggregate contract value of firm orders excluding amounts previously recognized as revenue the 2017 contracted backlog includes 844 million expected to be recognized in revenues during 2018 with the remainder expected to be recognized in revenues in the years thereafter unfunded amounts included in backlog for certain firm government orders which are subject to annual funding were 13 billion and 846 million at december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively yearoveryear comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations due to the nature of varying delivery and milestone schedules on contracts funding of programs and the uncertainty of timing of future contract awards uncertainties in the federal government budgeting process could delay the funding or even result in cancellation of certain programs currently in our reported backlog 

  

other 

  

other consists of nonreportable segments in africa the middle east and asia amea and asia pacific that manufacture and sell metal beverage containers

sustainability 

  

sustainability is a key part of maximizing value at ball in our global operations we focus our sustainability efforts on employee safety energy water waste and air emissions in addition to operational excellence we identified product stewardship talent management and community ambassadors as priorities for our corporate sustainability efforts information about our corporate sustainability management goals and performance data are available at wwwballcomsustainability 

  

by enhancing the unique sustainability credentials of our products along their life cycle we position our metal containers as the most sustainable choice and help our customers grow their business because metal recycling saves resources and uses up to 20 times less energy than primary metal production the biggest opportunity to further minimize the environmental impacts of metal packaging is to increase recycling rates aluminum and steel are infinitely recyclable materials they also have the highest scrap value of all commonly used packaging substrates in 2017 aluminum beverage cans were confirmed to be the most recycled beverage package in the world with a global weighted average recycling rate for aluminum at 69 percent in comparison 43 percent of pet and 46 percent of glass bottles were collected for recycling although not necessarily recycled in some of ball’s markets such as brazil china and several european countries recycling rates for aluminum beverage cans are at or above 90 percent the most recently available recycling rates in europe are 73 percent for aluminum beverage containers in 2014 and 78 percent for steel containers in 2015 the most recently available recycling rates in the us are 49 percent for aluminum beverage cans in 2016 and 71 percent for steel cans in 2014 

  

in markets where recycling rates are below expectations we help establish and financially support packaging collection and recycling initiatives these typically focus on collaborating with public and private partners to create effective collection and recycling systems including education of consumers about the benefits of metal packaging for details about programs we support please visit wwwballcomrecycling

 item 1a risk factors 

  

any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of rexam or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected we may also encounter significant unexpected difficulties in integrating the two businesses 

  

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of rexam will depend to a large extent on our ability to integrate our beverage packaging business with rexam’s business combining two independent businesses is a complex costly and timeconsuming process as a result we are required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of the company and the rexam business we acquired the integration process may disrupt the combined business and if implemented ineffectively could preclude the realization of the full benefits of the acquisition that are currently expected our failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the two businesses and to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in the activities of the company and could adversely affect the company’s results of operations in addition the overall integration of the businesses may result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses loss of customer relationships and diversion of management’s attention the possible difficulties of combining the operations of the companies also include among others 

  

















  

many of these factors are or will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy which could materially impact the business financial condition and results of operations of the company in addition even if the operations of the businesses of the company and rexam are integrated successfully we may not realize the full benefits of the acquisition including the synergies cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect or the full benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the businesses of the company and rexam all of these factors could adversely affect the earnings of the company decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisition or negatively impact the price of the company’s common stock as a result we cannot assure that the combination of the company’s and rexam’s beverage packaging businesses will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the acquisition 

  

in connection with satisfying requirements under the antitrust laws of the us the european union and brazil and obtaining associated approvals and clearances we were required to effect significant divestitures as a result of the required divestitures we may not realize all or a significant portion of the anticipated benefits of the rexam acquisition including anticipated synergies and the company may otherwise suffer other negative consequences that may materially and adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations and to the extent that the current price of the company’s common stock reflects an assumption that the anticipated benefits of the acquisition will be realized the price per share for the company’s common stock could be negatively impacted 

  

 

we have a significant level of debt that could have important consequences for our business and any investment in our securities 

  

the company had 7 billion of interestbearing debt at december 31 2017 such indebtedness could have significant consequences for our business and any investment in our securities including 

  











  

our business operating results and financial condition are subject to particular risks in certain regions of the world 

  

we may experience an operating loss in one or more regions of the world for one or more periods which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition moreover overcapacity which often leads to lower prices exists in certain regions in which we operate and may persist even if demand grows our ability to manage such operational fluctuations and to maintain adequate longterm strategies in the face of such developments will be critical to our continued growth and profitability 

  

the loss of a key customer or a reduction in its requirements could have a significant negative impact on our sales 

  

we sell a majority of our packaging products to a relatively limited number of major beverage packaged food personal care and household product companies some of which operate in multiple geographical markets we serve 

  

although the majority of our customer contracts are longterm these contracts unless they are renewed expire in accordance with their respective terms and are terminable under certain circumstances such as our failure to meet quality volume or market pricing requirements because we depend on a relatively limited number of major customers our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss of any of these customers a reduction in the purchasing levels of these customers a strike or work stoppage by a significant number of these customers’ employees or an adverse change in the terms of the supply agreements with these customers 

  

the primary customers for our aerospace segment are us government agencies or their prime contractors our contracts with these customers are subject to several risks including funding cuts and delays technical uncertainties budget changes government shutdowns competitive activity and changes in scope 

  

we face competitive risks from many sources that may negatively impact our profitability 

  

competition within the packaging and aerospace industries is intense increases in productivity combined with existing or potential surplus capacity in the industry have maintained competitive pricing pressures the principal methods of competition in the general packaging industry are price innovation sustainability service and quality in the aerospace industry they are technical capability cost and schedule some of our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources and some may currently have significant excess capacity our current or potential competitors may offer products at a lower price or products that are deemed superior to ours the global economic environment has resulted in reductions in demand for our products in some instances which in turn could increase these competitive pressures 

  

we are subject to competition from alternative products which could result in lower profits and reduced cash flows 

  

our metal packaging products are subject to significant competition from substitute products particularly plastic carbonated soft drink bottles made from pet single serve beer bottles and other food and beverage containers made of glass cardboard or other materials competition from plastic carbonated soft drink bottles is particularly intense in the us europe and the prc certain of our aerospace products are also subject to competition from alternative products 

 

and solutions there can be no assurance that our products will successfully compete against alternative products which could result in a reduction in our profits or cash flow 

  

our packaging businesses have a narrow product range and our business would suffer if usage of our products decreased or if decreases occur in the demand for the beverages food and other goods filled in our products 

  

for the year ended december 31 2017 81 percent of our consolidated net sales were from the sale of beverage containers and we expect to derive a significant portion of our future revenues and cash flows from the sale of beverage containers our business would suffer if the use of beverage containers decreased accordingly broad acceptance by consumers of aluminum and steel containers for a wide variety of beverages is critical to our future success if demand for glass and pet bottles increases relative to metal containers or the demand for aluminum and steel containers does not develop as expected our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

  

changes in laws and governmental regulations may adversely affect our business and operations 

  

we and our customers and suppliers are subject to various federal state provincial and local laws and regulations which have been increasing in number and complexity each of our and their facilities is subject to federal state provincial and local licensing and regulation by health environmental workplace safety and other agencies in multiple jurisdictions requirements of worldwide governmental authorities with respect to manufacturing manufacturing facility locations within the jurisdiction product content and safety climate change workplace safety and health environmental expropriation of assets and other standards could adversely affect our ability to manufacture or sell our products and the ability of our customers and suppliers to manufacture and sell their products in addition we face risks arising from compliance with and enforcement of numerous and complex federal state provincial and local laws and regulations 

  

enacted regulatory developments regarding the reporting and use of “conflict minerals” mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries could affect the sourcing availability and price of minerals used in the manufacture of certain of our products as a result there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflictfree materials and we cannot give assurance that we will be able to obtain such products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices also because our supply chains are complex we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of all materials used in the products that we sell the compliance and reporting aspects of these regulations may result in incremental costs to the company while deposit systems and other containerrelated legislation have been adopted in some jurisdictions similar legislation has been defeated in public referenda and legislative bodies in many others we anticipate that continuing efforts will be made to consider and adopt such legislation in the future the packages we produce are widely used and perform well in us states canadian provinces and european countries that have deposit systems as well as in other countries worldwide 

  

significant environmental employmentrelated and other legislation and regulatory requirements exist and are also evolving the compliance costs associated with current and proposed laws and potential regulations could be substantial and any failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws or regulations could lead to litigation or governmental action all of which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

  

our business financial condition and results of operations are subject to risks resulting from broader geographic operations 

  

we derived 50 percent of our consolidated net sales from outside of the us for the year ended december 31 2017 the sizeable scope of operations outside of the us may lead to more volatile financial results and make it more difficult for us to manage our business reasons for this include but are not limited to the following 

  













  

 

any of these factors many of which are present in both the us and other countries could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

we are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations 

  

the financial results of the company are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations and an increased proportion of assets liabilities and earnings denominated in nonus dollar currencies the company presents its financial statements in us dollars and has a significant proportion of its net assets debt and income in nonus dollar currencies primarily the euro as well as the russian ruble and other emerging market currencies the company’s financial results and capital ratios are therefore sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates 

  

we manage our exposure to currency fluctuations particularly our exposure to fluctuations in the euro to us dollar exchange rate to attempt to mitigate the effect of cash flow and earnings volatility associated with exchange rate changes we primarily use forward contracts and options to manage our currency exposures and as a result we experience gains and losses on these derivative positions offset in part by the impact of currency fluctuations on existing assets and liabilities our inability to properly manage our exposure to currency fluctuations could materially impact our results 

  

if we fail to retain key management and personnel we may be unable to implement our key objectives 

  

we believe our future success depends in part on our experienced management team unforeseen losses of key members of our management team without appropriate succession andor compensation planning could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet our objectives 

  

decreases in our ability to develop or apply new technology and knowhow may affect our competitiveness 

  

our success depends partially on our ability to improve production processes and services we must also introduce new products and services to meet changing customer needs if we are unable to implement better production processes or to develop new products through research and development or licensing of new technology we may not be able to remain competitive with other manufacturers as a result our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

adverse weather and climate changes may result in lower sales 

  

we manufacture packaging products primarily for beverages and foods unseasonably cool weather can reduce demand for certain beverages packaged in our containers in addition poor weather conditions or changes in climate that reduce crop yields of fruits and vegetables can adversely affect demand for our food containers climate change could have various effects on the demand for our products and the costs of inputs to our production in different regions around the world 

  

we are vulnerable to fluctuations in the supply and price of raw materials 

  

we purchase aluminum steel and other raw materials and packaging supplies from several sources while all such materials are available from independent suppliers raw materials are subject to fluctuations in price and availability attributable to a number of factors including general economic conditions commodity price fluctuations particularly aluminum on the london metal exchange the demand by other industries for the same raw materials and the availability of complementary and substitute materials although we enter into commodities purchase agreements from time to time and sometimes use derivative instruments to seek to manage our risk we cannot ensure that our current suppliers of raw materials will be able to supply us with sufficient quantities at reasonable prices economic and financial factors could impact our suppliers thereby causing supply shortages increases in raw material costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in the americas europe and asia some contracts do not allow us to pass along increased raw material costs and we generally use derivative agreements to seek to manage this risk our hedging procedures may be insufficient and our results could be materially impacted if costs of materials increase due to the fixedprice contracts and derivative activities while increasing raw material costs may not impact our nearterm profitability increased prices could decrease our sales volume over time 

  

 

prolonged work stoppages at facilities with union employees could jeopardize our financial position 

  

as of december 31 2017 22 percent of our north american packaging facility employees and 59 percent of our european employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements these collective bargaining agreements have staggered expirations during the next several years although we consider our employee relations to be generally good a prolonged work stoppage or strike at any facility with union employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition we cannot ensure that upon the expiration of existing collective bargaining agreements new agreements will be reached without union action or that any such new agreements will be on terms satisfactory to us 

  

our aerospace segment is subject to certain risks specific to that business 

  

in our aerospace business us government contracts are subject to reduction or modification in the event of changes in requirements and the government may also terminate contracts at its convenience pursuant to standard termination provisions in such instances ball may be entitled to reimbursement for allowable costs and profits on authorized work that has been performed through the date of termination 

  

in addition budgetary constraints and government shutdowns may result in further reductions to projected spending levels by the us government in particular government expenditures are subject to the potential for automatic reductions generally referred to as “sequestration” sequestration may occur in any given year resulting in significant additional reductions to spending by various us government defense and aerospace agencies on both existing and new contracts as well as the disruption of ongoing programs even if sequestration does not occur we expect that budgetary constraints and ongoing concerns regarding the us national debt will continue to place downward pressure on agency spending levels due to these and other factors overall spending on various programs could decline which could result in significant reductions to revenue cash flows net earnings and backlog primarily in our aerospace segment 

  

we use estimates in accounting for many of our programs in our aerospace business and changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results 

  

we account for sales and profits on the majority of longterm contracts in our aerospace business in accordance with the percentageofcompletion method of accounting using the cumulative catchup method to account for updates in estimates the percentageofcompletion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project revenues and costs at completion and various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events including the quantity and timing of product deliveries future labor performance and rates and material and overhead costs these assumptions involve various levels of expected performance improvements under the cumulative catchup method the impact of updates in our estimates related to units shipped to date is recognized immediately 

  

because of the significance of the judgments and estimates described above it is likely that we could record materially different amounts if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances or estimates were to change accordingly updates in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates may materially affect our future financial performance 

  

our backlog includes both costtype and fixedprice contracts costtype contracts generally have lower profit margins than fixedprice contracts our earnings and margins may vary depending on the types of government contracts undertaken the nature of the work performed under those contracts the costs incurred in performing the work the achievement of other performance objectives and their impact on our ability to receive fees the fixedprice contracts could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate 

  

as a us government contractor we could be adversely affected by changes in regulations or any negative findings from a us government audit or investigation 

  

our aerospace business operates in a highly regulated environment and is routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its agencies such as the defense contract audit agency dcaa and defense contract management agency dcma these agencies review performance under our contracts our cost structure and our compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies business systems that are subject to review under the dod federal acquisition regulation supplement dfars are purchasing estimating material management and accounting as well as property and earned value management any costs ultimately found to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not 

 

be reimbursed or must be refunded if already reimbursed if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties sanctions or suspension or debarment from doing business with the us government whether or not illegal activities are alleged the us government also has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate if such actions were to result in suspension or debarment this could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

our business is subject to substantial environmental remediation and compliance costs 

  

our operations are subject to federal state provincial and local laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions relating to environmental hazards such as emissions to air discharges to water the handling and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes and the cleanup of hazardous substances we have been designated along with numerous other companies as a potentially responsible party for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites based on available information we do not believe that any costs incurred in connection with such sites will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations capital expenditures or competitive position there is increased focus on the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental issues worldwide 

  

our business faces the potential of increased regulation on some of the raw materials utilized in our packaging operations 

  

our operations are subject to federal state provincial and local laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions relating to some of the raw materials such as epoxybased coatings utilized in our container making process epoxybased coatings may contain bisphenola bpa scientific evidence evaluated by regulatory agencies in the us canada europe japan australia and new zealand has consistently shown these coatings to be safe for food contact at current levels and these regulatory agencies have stated that human exposure to bpa from epoxybased container coatings is well below safe exposure limits set by government bodies worldwide a significant change in these regulatory agency statements adverse information concerning bpa or rulings made within certain federal state provincial and local jurisdictions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations ball recognizes that significant interest exists in nonepoxy based coatings and we have been proactively working with coatings suppliers and our customers to evaluate alternatives to current coatings 

  

net earnings and net assets could be materially affected by an impairment of goodwill 

  

we have a significant amount of goodwill recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2017 we are required at least annually to test the recoverability of goodwill the recoverability test of goodwill is based on the current fair value of our identified reporting units fair value measurement requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors including revenue and market growth operating cash flows and discount rates if general market conditions deteriorate in portions of our business we could experience a significant decline in the fair value of reporting units this decline could lead to an impairment of all or a significant portion of the goodwill balance which could materially affect our us gaap net earnings and net assets we continue to see the industry supply of beverage packaging exceed demand in china resulting in significant pricing pressure and negative impacts on the profitability of our beverage packaging asia pacific reporting unit if it becomes an expectation that this situation will continue for an extended period of time it may result in a noncash impairment of some or all of the goodwill associated with this reporting unit totaling 78 million at december 31 2017 the company’s annual goodwill impairment test completed in the fourth quarter of 2017 indicated the estimated fair value of the beverage packaging asia pacific reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount including goodwill by 24 percent 

  

if the investments in ball’s pension plans or in the multiemployer pension plans in which ball participates do not perform as expected we may have to contribute additional amounts to the plans which would otherwise be available for other general corporate purposes 

  

ball maintains defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of its north american and united kingdom employees which are funded based on certain actuarial assumptions the plans’ assets consist primarily of common stocks fixedincome securities and in the us alternative investments market declines longevity increases or legislative changes such as the pension protection act in the us could result in a prospective decrease in our available cash flow and net earnings over time and the recognition of an increase in our pension obligations could result in a reduction to our shareholders’ equity additional risks exist related to the company’s participation in multiemployer pension plans assets contributed to a multiemployer pension plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers if a participating employer in a multiemployer pension plan stops 

 

contributing to the plan the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participants this could result in increases to our contributions to the plans as well as pension expense 

  

restricted access to capital markets could adversely affect our shortterm liquidity and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the notes issued pursuant to our bond indentures 

  

a reduction in global market liquidity could 

  











  

if market interest rates increase our variablerate debt will create higher debt service requirements which would adversely affect our cash flow while we sometimes enter into agreements limiting our exposure any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk 

  

the global credit financial and economic environment could have a negative impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

the overall credit financial and economic environment could have significant negative effects on our operations including 

  









  

changes in us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap and sec rules and regulations could materially impact our reported results 

  

us gaap and sec accounting and reporting changes are common and have become more frequent and significant over the past several years these changes could have significant effects on our reported results when compared to prior periods and other companies and may even require us to retrospectively adjust prior periods additionally material changes to the presentation of transactions in the consolidated financial statements could impact key ratios that analysts and credit rating agencies use to rate ball and ultimately impact our ability to access the credit markets in an efficient manner 

  

earnings and cash flows can be impacted by changes in tax laws 

  

as a usbased multinational business the company is subject to income tax in the us and numerous jurisdictions outside the us the relevant tax rules and regulations are complex often changing and in some cases are interdependent if these or other tax rules and regulations should change the company’s earnings and cash flows could be impacted 

  

in particular the us tax cuts and jobs act the act which was signed into law on december 22 2017 may result in fluctuations in the company’s net earnings and cash flows the act introduced major changes to us income tax law 

 

that require significant judgment to interpret the impact of the provisions of the act on the company’s financial results 

due to the timing of its enactment and the complexity associated with the provisions of the act the company has made reasonable estimates of its effects where possible and has recorded provisional estimates in its financial statements for the year ended december 31 2017 the internal revenue service and the us treasury department may issue subsequent guidance on the provisions of the act that differs from our current interpretations as we continue to collect data prepare analyses and interpret additional guidance provided by standardsetting bodies we may make adjustments to these provisional estimates that could materially affect the company’s financial results 

  

the company’s worldwide provision for income taxes is determined in part through the use of significant estimates and judgments numerous transactions arise in the ordinary course of business where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain the company undergoes tax examinations by various worldwide tax authorities on a regular basis while the company believes its estimates of its tax obligations are reasonable the final outcome after the conclusion of any tax examinations and any litigation could be materially different from what has been reflected in the company’s historical financial statements 

  

increased information technology it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems networks products solutions and services 

  

increased global it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including employee training comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems networks products solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats depending on their nature and scope such threats could potentially lead to the compromise of confidential information improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which in turn could adversely affect our reputation competitiveness and results of operations 

  

a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could if not remediated result in material misstatements in our financial statements 

  

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act as disclosed in item 9a in the 2016 form 10k filing and item 4 of the subsequent 2017 form 10q filings management identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting connected to deficiencies associated with the accounting for income taxes related to the sale of some of the company’s existing beverage packaging businesses and select beverage can assets of rexam the divestment business and the discrete income tax effects related to the acquisition of rexam a material weakness is defined as a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis as a result of this material weakness management concluded that internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organization of the treadway commission in “ internal control—an integrated framework 2013” during 2017 we proactively implemented a remediation plan designed to address this material weakness which has been evaluated and the material weakness is now considered remediated if remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weakness or if additional material weaknesses in internal control are discovered or occur in the future our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results 

  

significant developments stemming from the uk’s referendum on membership in the eu could have a material adverse effect on us 

  

in june 2016 the uk held a referendum and voted in favor of leaving the european union eu this referendum has created political and economic uncertainty particularly in the uk and the eu and this uncertainty may last for years particularly as the uk and the eu continue to negotiate the terms of withdrawal from the eu our business in the uk the eu and worldwide could be affected during this period of uncertainty and perhaps longer by the impact of the uk’s referendum and withdrawal from the eu there are many ways in which our business could be affected only some of which we can identify at the present time 

  

 

the referendum and the likely withdrawal of the uk from the eu it triggers has caused and along with events that could occur in the future as a consequence of the uk’s withdrawal including the possible breakup of the uk or the eu may continue to cause significant volatility in global financial markets including in global currency and debt markets this volatility could cause a slowdown in economic activity in the uk europe or globally which could adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects in addition our business could be negatively affected by new trade agreements between the uk and other countries including the us and by the possible imposition of trade or other regulatory barriers in the uk these possible negative impacts and others resulting from the uk ’ s actual or threatened withdrawal from the eu may adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

management’s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k annual report which include additional information about our accounting policies practices and the transactions underlying our financial results the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes including various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits taxes environmental and other matters arising during the normal course of business we apply our best judgment our knowledge of existing facts and circumstances and actions that we may undertake in the future in determining the estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances such as current economic conditions and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change as future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision actual results may differ from these estimates ball corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as “ball corporation” “ball” “the company” “we” or “our” in the following discussion and analysis 

  

overview 

  

business overview and industry trends 

  

ball corporation is one of the world’s leading suppliers of metal packaging to the beverage food personal care and household products industries our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses are manufactured in facilities around the world and are competitive with other substrates such as plastics and glass in the rigid packaging industry sales and earnings can be increased by reducing costs increasing prices developing new products expanding volumes and making strategic acquisitions we also provide aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers 

  

we sell our packaging products mainly to large multinational beverage food personal care and household products companies with which we have developed longterm relationships this is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of longterm supply contracts while we have a diversified customer base we sell a significant portion of our packaging products to major companies and brands as well as to numerous regional customers the overall metal container industry is growing globally and is expected to continue to grow in the medium to long term despite the north american industry having seen recent declines in standardsized aluminum beverage packaging for the carbonated soft drink market the primary customers for the products and services provided by our aerospace segment are us government agencies or their prime contractors 

  

we purchase our raw materials from relatively few suppliers we also have exposure to inflation in particular the rising costs of raw materials as well as other direct cost inputs we mitigate our exposure to the changes in the costs of metal through the inclusion of provisions in contracts covering the majority of our volumes to pass through metal price changes as well as through the use of derivative instruments the passthrough provisions generally result in proportional increases or decreases in sales and costs with a greatly reduced impact if any on net earnings because of our customer and supplier concentration our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss insolvency or bankruptcy of a major customer or supplier or a change in a supply agreement with a major customer or supplier although our contract provisions generally mitigate the risk of customer loss and our longterm relationships represent a known stable customer base 

  

we recognize sales under longterm contracts in our aerospace segment using percentageofcompletion under the costtocost method of accounting throughout the period of contract performance we regularly reevaluate and if necessary revise our estimates of aerospace total contract revenue total contract cost and progress toward completion because of contract payment schedules limitations on funding and other contract terms our sales and accounts receivable for this segment include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed 

  

 

corporate strategy 

  

our drive for 10 vision encompasses five strategic levers that are key to growing our business and achieving longterm success since launching drive for 10 in 2011 we have made progress on each of the levers as follows 

  



  



  



  



  



  

these ongoing business developments and the successful acquisition of rexam completed on june 30 2016 help us stay close to our customers while expanding andor sustaining our industry positions and global reach with major beverage food personal care household products and aerospace customers 

  

results of operations 

  

management’s discussion and analysis for our results of operations on a consolidated and segment basis include a quantification of factors that had a material impact other factors that did not have a material impact but that are significant to understand the results are qualitatively described 

  

consolidated sales and earnings 

  



  

sales in 2017 were 19 billion higher compared to 2016 primarily as a result of increased sales volumes for our north and central america south america and europe segments increased pass through of higher metal prices for our north and central america and south america segments favorable currency exchange effects for our europe segment 

 

favorable product mix for our south america segment and increased sales in our aerospace segment sales volumes for the year ended december 31 2017 for our north and central america south america and europe segments were higher compared to the same period in 2016 primarily as a result of 2017 including twelve months of sales volumes from the acquired rexam business while 2016 included six months of sales volumes from the acquired rexam business and six months of sales volumes from the company’s legacy business a significant portion of which was sold with the divestment business the south america segment experienced organic sales growth and increased sales from significant us national defense contracts drove revenue growth in the aerospace segment 

  

net earnings attributable to ball corporation in 2017 were 111 million higher than 2016 primarily due to increased earnings related to higher sales volumes in the south america europe and north and central america beverage can segments synergy realizations lower cost of sales in 2017 compared to 2016 which included 84 million for the stepup of inventory related to the acquired rexam business lower debt refinancing and other costs in 2017 and a decrease in business consolidation and other activities in 2017 partially offset by higher incremental depreciation these impacts on net earnings were partially offset by higher tax expense in 2017 due principally to provisional charges from the us tax cuts and jobs act which was signed into law on december 22 2017 income tax benefits in 2016 associated with the restructure of brazil legal entities as a result of the sale of the divestment business the tax benefit on transaction costs and derivative costs of the rexam acquisition and sale of the divestment business in 2016 

  

debt refinancing and other costs in 2017 were lower compared to 2016 which included costs on debt associated with the rexam acquisition see note 13 located in item 8 of this annual report for additional information on the activity in debt refinancing and other costs 

  

the increase in net sales in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to sales of 15 billion related to the acquired rexam business net of ball’s legacy sales included in the divestment business this increase was partially offset by lower metal input costs passed through to customers of 299 million net earnings were lower in 2016 compared to 2015 due to higher business consolidation and other activities from increased costs associated with the rexam acquisition and the sale of the divestment business increased depreciation and amortization primarily attributable to depreciation and amortization associated with the acquired rexam business recognition in cost of sales of 84 million stepup of inventory related to the acquired rexam business higher interest expense associated with the net increase in borrowings to fund the cash portion of the purchase price of rexam and increased selling general and administrative costs also due to costs from the acquired rexam business these decreases were partially offset by a gain of 344 million in 2016 recognized on the sale of the ball legacy portion of the divestment business lower income tax expense in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to the tax impacts of the sale of the divestment business earnings from the increase in net sales from the acquired rexam business net of the sale of ball’s legacy portion of the divestment business lower net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests and higher equity in results of affiliates 

  

the decreased debt refinancing and other costs in 2016 compared to 2015 included marktomarket losses on derivative financial instruments designed to mitigate exposure to interest rate changes for debt issuances related to the rexam acquisition interest expense on issued 35 percent and 4375 percent senior notes used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the rexam acquisition the write off of unamortized deferred financing charges for the partial extinguishment of the committed bridge loan agreement and the revolving credit facility and amortization of deferred financing costs for the committed bridge loan agreement see note 13 located in item 8 of this annual report for additional information on financial instruments 

  

cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization 

  

cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization was 8717 million in 2017 compared to 7296 million in 2016 and 6460 million in 2015 these amounts represented 79 percent 81 percent and 81 percent of consolidated net sales for the years ended 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively cost of sales in 2016 included expense of 84 million for the stepup of inventory related to the acquired rexam business 

  

depreciation and amortization 

  

depreciation and amortization expense was 729 million in 2017 compared to 453 million in 2016 and 286 million in 2015 these amounts represented 7 percent 5 percent and 4 percent of consolidated net sales for 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively the expense was higher in 2017 compared to 2016 due to increased depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets following the rexam acquisition during 2017 the company finalized the valuation of 

 

the assets acquired in the rexam acquisition as a result depreciation and amortization expense for 2017 included a cumulative catchup adjustment of 35 million related to the last six months of 2016 depreciation expense was higher in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to the acquired rexam fixed assets amortization expense in 2017 and 2016 included 162 million and 65 million respectively for the amortization of acquired rexam intangibles 

  

selling general and administrative 

  

selling general and administrative sga expenses were 514 million in 2017 compared to 512 million in 2016 and 450 million in 2015 these amounts represented 5 percent 6 percent and 6 percent of consolidated net sales for those three years respectively the lower percentage of sga expense in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to office closures and various other costout initiatives implemented by the company in relation to the acquired rexam business the increase in sga expenses in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to additional sga from the acquired rexam business and foreign exchange losses of 27 million for the devaluation of the egyptian pound in the fourth quarter of 2016 

  

business consolidation costs and other activities 

  

business consolidation and other activities were 221 million in 2017 compared to 337 million in 2016 and 195 million in 2015 these amounts represented 2 percent 4 percent and 2 percent of consolidated net sales for the three years respectively 

  

the yearoveryear decrease in business consolidation and other activities in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to a decrease of 322 million in rexam transaction related costs and 83 million of rexam acquisition related compensation arrangements and a decrease of 173 million in foreign currency exchange losses associated with the rexam transaction these impacts were partially offset by a decrease of 289 million in the gain recognized in connection with the sale of the ball portion of the divestment business an increase of 99 million related to completed and pending plant closures an increase of 44 million related to the settlement of certain ball us defined benefit pension plans and an increase of 34 million for indemnification of certain tax matters provided to the buyer in the sale of the divestment business see note 5 located in item 8 of this annual report for additional information on the activity in business consolidation and other activities 

  

the yearoveryear increase in business consolidation and other activities for 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to an increase of 202 million for transaction related costs foreign currency exchange losses of 159 million on foreign currencydenominated restricted cash and debt and 108 million in expense for compensation arrangements all associated with the rexam acquisition and the sale of the divestment business the increase was partially offset by a gain of 344 million in connection with the sale of the divestment business the valuations of currency exchange and interest rates were a primary driver for the amounts recorded in business consolidation and other activities in 2016 see notes 4 and 5 located in item 8 of this annual report for additional information on the rexam transaction and business consolidation and other activities

total interest expense was 288 million in 2017 compared to 338 million in 2016 and 260 million in 2015 excluding debt refinancing and other costs interest expense in 2017 was higher than in 2016 as the average level of debt held during the year was higher following the rexam acquisition excluding debt refinancing and other costs interest expense in 2016 was higher compared to 2015 as the company incurred additional debt to pay a portion of the cash consideration due to rexam’s shareholders for the rexam acquisition interest expense excluding the effect of debt refinancing and other costs as a percentage of average monthly borrowings was 4 percent in each of the years 2017 2016 and 2015 

  

debt refinancing and other costs were 3 million for the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to 109 million for the year ended december 31 2016 the amount for the year ended 2016 consisted mainly of 1 interest expense of 49 million through june 30 2016 on the 35 percent and 4375 percent senior notes issued in december 2015 2 fair value changes of 20 million on derivative instruments designed to mitigate risks of interest rate changes with debt issuances 3 interest expense of 30 million through june 30 2016 on term a us dollar and term a euro dollar loans associated with the company’s credit facility and 4 amortization of deferred financing fees of 7 million for the

tax provision 

  

the effective tax rate is affected by recurring items such as income earned in foreign jurisdictions with tax rates that differ from the us tax rate and by discrete items that may occur in any given year but are not consistent from year to year 

  

the 2017 effective income tax rate was 321 percent compared to negative 1008 percent for 2016 the effective rate was increased by 161 percent for us tax reform including the impact of the transition tax and remeasurement of the company’s net deferred tax asset in the us and by 35 percent for discrete tax costs associated with certain business dispositions the effective rate was reduced by 72 percent for the impact of the foreign tax rate differential net of valuation allowance impact and tax holidays versus the us tax rate and by 54 percent for the impact of current year changes in various foreign tax laws including the uk the 2017 effective rate was also reduced by 31 percent for the discrete tax benefit associated with the adoption in the first quarter of 2017 of amendments to existing accounting guidance for stockbased compensation by 18 percent for the impact of the us rd credit and by 16 percent for the impact of the us domestic manufacturing deduction and of the foregoing the impact of us tax reform discrete tax costs associated with certain business dispositions the impact of current year changes to certain foreign tax laws and the impact of the domestic manufacturing deduction are primarily related to discrete transactions or changes in tax law that are not expected to recur in future periods 

  

the 2016 full year effective income tax rate was negative 1008 percent compared to 136 percent for 2015 the lower tax rate in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a 1160 percentage point reduction for the tax benefit recorded with respect to tax deductible goodwill in a legal entity restructuring in brazil that was completed in 2016 the tax rate was also reduced by 568 percentage points for increased benefits from foreign tax rate differences primarily due to acquisitions and by 496 percentage points for permanent tax differences on significant 2016 business dispositions these amounts were partially offset by a 416 percentage point increase for nondeductible transaction costs related to 2016 acquisitions and a 368 percentage point increase for increases in valuation allowances primarily on losses in the uk in 2016 we incurred a significant amount of nonrecurring business consolidation costs primarily in the us the resulting reduction in earnings before income tax as a result of these costs increased the impact of permanent income tax items on the company’s effective tax rate in 2016 as compared to 2015 

  

on december 22 2017 the us tax cuts and jobs act the act was signed into law the act significantly changed us income tax law by among other things reducing the us federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent transitioning from a global tax system to a modified territorial tax system eliminating the domestic manufacturing deduction providing for immediate expensing of certain qualified capital expenditures and limiting the tax deductions for interest expense and executive compensation in the fourth quarter of 2017 the company recorded tax expense of 83 million for the estimated impact of the mandatory deemed repatriation of its foreign earnings and revaluation of its us deferred tax assets and liabilities the company’s review of the implications of the act will be ongoing throughout 2018 and as such adjustments to any provisional estimates of the act’s impact may be required these provisional estimates are as follows 

  



 









  

due to the complexity of the new provisions for global intangible lowtaxed income gilti and the base erosion antiabuse tax beat the company is continuing to evaluate the accounting implications of these provisions of the act the company is allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either 1 treating taxes due for gilti or beat as a currentperiod expense when incurred or 2 factoring such amounts into the company’s measurement of its deferred taxes the calculation of the impact and selection of an accounting policy will depend on a detailed analysis of the company’s global income and other tax attributes to determine the potential impact if any of these provisions the company is not currently able to determine a reasonable estimate for these items as a result no estimate has been recorded and no policy decision has yet been made regarding whether to factor the impact of gilti or beat into the company’s measurement of its deferred taxes 

  

in future periods while we cannot estimate the impact on our effective tax rate the company expects the act to favorably impact net earnings diluted earnings per share and cash flows primarily due to the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate effective as of january 1 2018 we do not expect the act to have a material impact on our state income tax

food and aerosol packaging 

  



a further details of these items are included in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

  

the food and aerosol packaging segment consists of operations located in the us europe canada mexico argentina and india that manufacture and sell steel food and aerosol containers  extruded aluminum aerosol containers and slugs in march 2017 we sold our paint and general line can facility in hubbard ohio and in october 2016 we sold our specialty tin manufacturing facility in baltimore maryland during the first quarter of 2016 we announced the closure of our food and aerosol packaging flat sheet production and endmaking facility in weirton west virginia which ceased production in the first quarter of 2017 

  

segment sales in 2017 were 33 million lower compared to 2016 the decrease in 2017 was primarily due to lower food can sales volumes and the sale of the company’s baltimore maryland and hubbard ohio plants 

  

comparable operating earnings in 2017 were 7 million lower compared to 2016 primarily due to further food can volume and pricecost compression onetime startup costs for our new flat sheet operations in canton ohio during 2017 and the sale of the company’s baltimore and hubbard plants which were partially offset by favorable aerosol product mix and various costout initiatives 

  

segment sales in 2016 were 126 million lower compared to 2015 as a result of 57 million in lower prices resulting from lower metal costs passed through to customers and 69 million in volume primarily driven by lower food can sales volumes comparable operating earnings in 2016 were relatively unchanged compared to 2015 due to improved extruded aluminum sales which offset the decline in food can sales volumes 

  

aerospace 

  



a further details of these items are included in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

  

the aerospace segment consists of the manufacture and sale of aerospace and other related products and services provided for the defense civil space and commercial space industries 

  

segment sales in 2017 were 173 million higher compared to 2016 and comparable operating earnings were 10 million higher the increase in sales and operating earnings for 2017 was primarily the result of increases from significant us national defense contracts 

  

 

segment sales in 2016 were relatively unchanged compared to 2015 comparable operating earnings in 2016 increased 6 million compared to 2015 due to individually immaterial items 

  

sales to the us government either directly as a prime contractor or indirectly as a subcontractor represented 98 percent of segment sales in 2017 compared to 97 percent of segment sales in 2016 and 96 percent in 2015 the aerospace contract mix in 2017 consisted of 63 percent costtype contracts which are billed at our costs plus an agreed upon andor earned profit component and 32 percent fixedprice contracts the remaining sales were for time and materials contracts 

  

contracted backlog for the aerospace segment at december 31 2017 and 2016 was 175 billion and 14 billion respectively the yearoveryear increase reflects several major contract awards during 2017 the segment has numerous outstanding bids for future contract awards the backlog at december 31 2017 consisted of 78 percent costtype contracts comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations due to the nature of varying delivery and milestone schedules on contracts funding of programs and the uncertainty of timing of future contract awards 

  

additional segment information 

  

for additional information regarding our segments see the business segment information in note 3 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report the charges recorded for business consolidation and other activities were based on estimates by ball management and were developed from information available at the time if actual outcomes vary from the estimates the differences will be reflected in current period earnings in the consolidated statement of earnings and identified as business consolidation gains and losses additional details about our business consolidation and other activities are provided in note 5 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

  

management performance measures 

  

management internally uses various measures to evaluate company performance such as comparable operating earnings earnings before interest taxes and business consolidation and other noncomparable costs comparable net earnings earnings before business consolidation costs and other noncomparable costs after tax return on average invested capital net operating earnings after tax over the relevant performance period divided by average invested capital over the same period economic value added eva® dollars net operating earnings after tax less a capital charge on average invested capital employed earnings before interest and taxes ebit earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda and diluted earnings per share management also uses free cash flow generally defined by the company as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures as a measure to evaluate the company’s liquidity we believe this information is also useful to investors as it provides insight into the earnings and cash flow criteria management uses to make strategic decisions these financial measures may be adjusted at times for items that affect comparability between periods such as business consolidation costs and gains or losses on acquisitions and dispositions 

  

nonfinancial measures in the packaging businesses include production efficiency and spoilage rates quality control figures environmental health and safety statistics production and sales volumes asset utilization rates and measures of sustainability additional measures used to evaluate financial performance in the aerospace segment include contract revenue realization award and incentive fees realized proposal win rates and backlog including awarded contracted and funded backlog 

  

the following financial measurements are on a nonus gaap basis and should be considered in connection with the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report nonus gaap measures should not be considered in isolation and should not be considered superior to or a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with us gaap a presentation of earnings in accordance with us gaap is available in item 8 of this annual report 

  

 

based on the above definitions our calculation of comparable operating earnings is summarized below

critical and significant accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements 

  

for information regarding the company’s critical and significant accounting policies as well as recent accounting pronouncements see notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

  

 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

  

cash flows and capital expenditures 

  

our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities and external committed borrowings we believe that cash flows from operations and cash provided by shortterm longterm and committed revolver borrowings when necessary will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements scheduled principal and interest payments on debt dividend payments and anticipated capital expenditures the following table summarizes our cash flows 

  



  

cash flows from operations in 2017 were higher compared to 2016 primarily due to improved earnings and working capital working capital changes in 2017 included a decrease in inventory days on hand from 68 to 61 days a decrease in days receivables outstanding from 46 to 45 days and an increase in days payable outstanding from 97 to 110 days the continuing increase in days payable outstanding is a result of longer negotiated contractual terms with suppliers 

  

cash flows from operations in 2016 were lower compared to 2015 due to increased operating cash outflows in 2016 due to payments of professional fees and employee costs related to the acquisition of rexam and sale of the divestment business of approximately 325 million 297 million of additional pension funding including 171 million related to the acquired rexam uk defined benefit plan approximately 150 million less cash inflows from working capital due to the sale of the company’s legacy european business at its peak working capital requirements 90 million of payments to settle derivatives associated with the acquired rexam business and 50 million of additional interest payments associated with the financing of the rexam acquisition inventory days on hand increased from 49 days to 68 days days sales outstanding increased from 35 days to 46 days and days payable outstanding increased from 82 days to 97 days the increase in days outstanding is primarily attributable to the working capital positions of the acquired rexam operations as compared to the legacy ball operations included in the divestment business 

  

we have entered into several regional committed and uncommitted accounts receivable factoring programs with various financial institutions for certain of our accounts receivable programs accounted for as true sales of the receivables without recourse to ball had combined limits of approximately 10 billion at december 31 2017 a total of 439 million and 374 million were available for sale under these programs at december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively 

  

annual cash dividends paid on common stock were 365 cents per share in 2017 and 26 cents per share in each of 2016 and 2015 as retrospectively adjusted for the twoforone stock split that was effective on may 16 2017 total dividends paid to common shareholders were 129 million in 2017 83 million in 2016 and 72 million in 2015 we paid dividends to noncontrolling interests of 5 million in 2017 and 18 million in 2015 no dividends were paid to noncontrolling interests in 2016 

  

as of december 31 2017 approximately 440 million of our cash was held outside of the us in the event that we would need to utilize any of the cash held outside of the us for purposes within the us there are no material legal or other economic restrictions regarding the repatriation of cash from any of the countries outside the us where we have cash other than market liquidity constraints that limit the ability to convert egyptian pounds held by the company in egypt with a us dollar equivalent value of 51 million into other currencies the company believes its us operating cash flows the 12 billion available under the company’s longterm revolving credit facilities the 110 million available under other usbased uncommitted shortterm credit facilities and availability under usbased committed and uncommitted accounts receivable factoring programs will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of the us portion of the company’s ongoing operations scheduled principal and interest payments on us debt dividend payments capital expenditures and other us cash requirements if foreign funds would be needed for our us cash requirements and we are unable to provide the funds through intercompany financing arrangements we would be required to repatriate funds from foreign locations where the company has previously asserted indefinite reinvestment of funds outside the us with the introduction of a modified territorial tax system in the recently enacted us tax cuts 

 

and jobs act the company is currently reviewing its previously stated intent to permanently reinvest these foreign amounts outside the us as the company does not believe a reasonable estimate of the impact of the us tax cuts and jobs act on its indefinite reinvestment assertion can be determined at present no provisional estimate is recorded in the financial statements for the period ended december 31 2017 when either a reasonable estimate or the final determination becomes available the impact will be recorded in that same reporting period the final determination will be made and the impact will be recorded no later than december of 2018 

  

based on its previous indefinite reinvestment assertion the company has not provided deferred taxes on earnings in certain nonus subsidiaries because such earnings were intended to be indefinitely reinvested in its international operations retained earnings in nonus subsidiaries were 28 billion as of december 31 2017 while it is not practical to estimate the additional taxes that may become payable if these earnings were remitted to the us as a result of the company’s inclusion of a provisional transition tax estimate us tax has been accrued with respect to this amount 

  

share repurchases 

  

the company’s share repurchases net of issuances totaled 76 million in 2017 59 million in 2016 and 100 million in 2015 the repurchases were completed using cash on hand and available borrowings and included accelerated share repurchase agreements and other purchases under our ongoing share repurchase program additional details about our share repurchase activities are provided in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

  

debt facilities and refinancing 

  

given our cash flow projections and unused credit facilities that are available until 2021 our liquidity is strong and is expected to meet our ongoing cash and debt service requirements total interestbearing debt was 7 billion at december 31 2017 compared to 75 billion at december 31 2016 

  

in anticipation of the june 2016 acquisition of rexam the company entered into a £33 billion bridge facility in february 2015 additionally in december 2015 ball issued 1 billion of 4375 percent senior notes €400 million of 35 percent senior notes and €700 million of 4375 percent senior notes the company elected to restrict these proceeds in an escrow account which enabled the reduction of its bridge facility to £19 billion 

  

in march 2016 ball refinanced in full its then existing £19 billion bridge facility with a 14 billion term a loan facility available to ball and a €11 billion term a loan facility available to a subsidiary of ball and refinanced in full its then existing revolving credit facility with a longterm multicurrency revolver available until march 2021 the euro term a loan was repaid during 2017 

  

at december 31 2017 taking into account outstanding letters of credit approximately 12 billion was available under the company’s longterm multicurrency committed revolving credit facilities which are available until march 2021 in addition to these facilities the company had 751 million of shortterm uncommitted credit facilities available at december 31 2017 of which 340 million was outstanding and due on demand the majority of these amounts are available without violating our existing debt covenants at december 31 2016 the company had 143 million outstanding under shortterm uncommitted credit facilities 

  

while ongoing financial and economic conditions in certain areas may raise concerns about credit risk with counterparties to derivative transactions the company mitigates its exposure by allocating the risk among various counterparties and limiting exposure to any one party we also monitor the credit ratings of our suppliers customers lenders and counterparties on a regular basis 

  

we were in compliance with all loan agreements at december 31 2017 and for all prior years presented and have met all debt payment obligations the us note agreements and bank credit agreement contain certain restrictions relating to dividends investments financial ratios guarantees and the incurrence of additional indebtedness the most restrictive of the company’s debt covenants requires the company to maintain a leverage ratio as defined of no greater than 4 times at december 31 2017 the company was in compliance with all loan agreements and debt covenants at december 31 2017 and 2016 and we have met all debt payment obligations as of december 31 2017 the amounts disclosed as available under the company’s longterm multicurrency committed revolving facilities the shortterm uncommitted 

 

credit facilities and the unsecured committed bridge loan agreement are available without violating our existing debt covenants additional details about our debt are available in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

  

other liquidity measures 

  

free cash flow 

  

management internally uses a free cash flow measure to 1 evaluate the company’s liquidity 2 evaluate strategic investments 3 plan stock buyback and dividend levels and 4 evaluate the company’s ability to incur and service debt free cash flow is not a defined term under us gaap and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures the company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures free cash flow is typically derived directly from the company’s consolidated statement of cash flows however it may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods 

  

based on the above definition our consolidated free cash flow is summarized as follows 

  



  

based on information currently available we estimate cash flows from operating activities for 2018 to be in the range of 15 billion capital expenditures to be approximately 600 million and free cash flow to be in the range of 900 million in 2018 we intend to utilize our operating cash flow to service debt and to fund our growth capital projects dividend payments stock buybacks and to the extent available acquisitions that meet our various criteria of the total 2018 estimated capital expenditures approximately 465 million was contractually committed as of december 31 2017 

  

commitments 

  

cash payments required for longterm debt maturities rental payments under noncancellable operating leases purchase obligations and other commitments in effect at december 31 2017 are summarized in the following table 

  







c for variable rate facilities amounts are based on interest rates in effect at year end and do not contemplate the effects of any hedging instruments utilized by the company 

d the company’s purchase obligations include capital expenditures and contracted amounts for aluminum steel and other direct materials also included are commitments for purchases of natural gas and electricity expenses related to aerospace and technologies contracts and other less significant items in cases where variable prices andor usage are involved management’s best estimates have been used depending on the circumstances early termination of the contracts may or may not result in penalties and therefore actual payments could vary significantly 

  

 

the table above does not include 84 million of uncertain tax positions the timing of which is unknown at this time 

  

contributions to the company’s defined benefit pension plans not including the unfunded german swedish and certain us plans are expected to be in the range of 46 million in 2018 this estimate may change based on changes in the pension protection act actual plan asset performance and available company cash flow among other factors benefit payments related to these plans are expected to be approximately 397 million to 416 million for each of the years ending december 31 2018 through 2022 and a total of 22 billion for the years 2023 through 2027 payments to participants in the unfunded german swedish and certain us plans are expected to be approximately 17 million to 21 million in each of the years 2018 through 2022 and a total of 80 million for the years 2023 through 2027 

  

based on changes in return on asset and discount rate assumptions as well as revisions based on plan experience studies total pension expense in 2018 excluding settlement and curtailment losses is anticipated to be approximately 20 million lower than in 2017 a reduction of the expected return on pension assets assumption by one quarter of a percentage point would result in an estimated 15 million increase in the 2018 pension expense while a quarter of a percentage point reduction in the discount rate applied to the pension liability would result in an estimated 3 million reduction of pension expense in 2018 additional details about our defined benefit pension plans are available in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

  

contingencies

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

financial instruments and risk management 

  

the company employs established risk management policies and procedures which seek to reduce the company’s commercial risk exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices interest rates currency exchange rates and prices of the company’s common stock with regard to common share repurchases and the company’s deferred compensation stock plan however there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be successful although the instruments utilized involve varying degrees of credit market and interest risk the counterparties to the agreements are expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements the company monitors counterparty credit risk including lenders on a regular basis but ball cannot be certain that all risks will be discerned or that its risk management policies and procedures will always be effective additionally in the event of default under the company’s master derivative agreements the nondefaulting party has the option to set off any amounts owed with regard to open derivative positions 

  

we have estimated our market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis market risk exposure has been defined as the changes in fair value of derivative instruments financial instruments and commodity positions to test the sensitivity of our market risk exposure we have estimated the changes in fair value of market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in market prices or rates the results of the sensitivity analyses are summarized below 

  

commodity price risk 

  

aluminum 

  

we manage commodity price risk in connection with market price fluctuations of aluminum ingot through two different methods first we enter into container sales contracts that include aluminum ingotbased pricing terms that generally reflect the same price fluctuations included in commercial purchase contracts for aluminum sheet the terms include fixed floating or passthrough aluminum ingot component pricing second we use derivative instruments such as option and forward contracts as economic and cash flow hedges of commodity price risk where there are material differences between sales and purchase contracted pricing and volume 

  

steel 

  

most sales contracts involving our steel products either include provisions permitting us to pass through some or all steel cost changes incurred or they incorporate annually negotiated steel prices we anticipate at this time that we will be able to pass through the majority of any steel price changes that may occur in 2018 

  

considering the effects of derivative instruments the company’s ability to pass through certain raw material costs through contractual provisions the market’s ability to accept price increases and the company’s commodity price exposures under its contract terms a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the company’s steel and aluminum prices would result in an estimated 8 million after tax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period additionally the company has currency exposures on raw materials and the effect of a 10 percent adverse change is included in the total currency exposure discussed below actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates 

  

other 

  

the company is also exposed to fluctuations in prices for natural gas and electricity as well as the cost of diesel fuel as a component of freight cost a hypothetical 10 percent increase in our natural gas and electricity prices would result in an estimated 14 million after tax reduction of net earnings over a oneyear period a hypothetical 10 percent increase in diesel fuel prices would result in a less than 1 million after tax reduction of net earnings over the same period actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates 

  

 

interest rate risk 

  

our objective in managing exposure to interest rate changes is to minimize the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to minimize our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we may use a variety of interest rate swaps collars and options to manage our mix of floating and fixedrate debt interest rate instruments held by the company at december 31 2017 included payfixed interest rate swaps which effectively convert variable rate obligations to fixedrate instruments 

  

based on our interest rate exposure at december 31 2017 assumed floating rate debt levels throughout the next 12 months and the effects of our existing derivative instruments a 100basis point increase in interest rates would result in an estimated 7 million after tax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates and the timing of these changes 

  

currency exchange rate risk 

  

our objective in managing exposure to currency fluctuations is to limit the exposure of cash flows and earnings from changes associated with currency exchange rate changes through the use of various derivative contracts in addition at times ball manages earnings translation volatility through the use of currency option strategies and the change in the fair value of those options is recorded in the company’s net earnings our currency translation risk results from the currencies in which we transact business the company faces currency exposures in our global operations as a result of various factors including intercompany currency denominated loans selling our products in various currencies purchasing raw materials and equipment in various currencies and tax exposures not denominated in the functional currency sales contracts are negotiated with customers to reflect cost changes and where there is not an exchange passthrough arrangement the company uses forward and option contracts to manage significant currency exposures 

  

considering the company’s derivative financial instruments outstanding at december 31 2017 and the various currency exposures a hypothetical 10 percent reduction us dollar strengthening mainly against the russian ruble in currency exchange rates compared to the us dollar would result in an estimated 15 million after tax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period this hypothetical adverse change in currency exchange rates would also reduce our forecasted average debt balance by 132 million and increase our forecasted cross currency swap value by 129 million actual changes in market prices or rates may differ from hypothetical changes 

  

common stock price risk 

  

the company’s deferred compensation stock program is subject to variable plan accounting and accordingly is marked to fair value using the company’s closing stock price at the end of the related reporting period the company entered into total return swaps to reduce the company’s earnings exposure to these fair value fluctuations that will be outstanding until june 2018 and such swaps have a combined notional value of 27 million shares based on current levels in the program each 1 change in the company’s stock price has an insignificant impact on pretax earnings net of the impact of related derivatives

our reporting segments 

  

ball corporation reports its financial performance in four reportable segments 1 metal beverage packaging americas and asia 2 metal beverage packaging europe 3 metal food and household products packaging and 4 aerospace and technologies ball also has investments in the us and vietnam that are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and accordingly those results are not included in segment sales or earnings financial information related to each of our segments is included in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report on form 10k annual report 

  

metal beverage packaging americas and asia segment 

  

metal beverage packaging americas and asia is ball’s largest segment accounting for 53 percent of consolidated net sales in 2015 metal beverage containers are primarily sold under multiyear supply contracts to fillers of carbonated soft drinks beer energy drinks and other beverages 

  

  

americas 

  

metal beverage containers and ends are produced at 15 manufacturing facilities in the us one in canada one in mexico and four in brazil ends are produced within three of the us facilities including one facility that manufactures only ends one facility in mexico and one facility in brazil additionally rocky mountain metal container llc a 50percent owned joint venture owned by ball and millercoors llc operates metal beverage container and end manufacturing facilities in golden colorado 

  

the north american metal beverage container manufacturing industry is relatively mature and industry volumes for certain types of containers have declined over the past several years where growth or contractions are projected in certain markets or for certain products ball undertakes selected capacity increases or decreases in its existing facilities to meet market demand a meaningful portion of the industrywide reduction in demand for standard 12ounce aluminum cans for the carbonated soft drink market is being offset with the growing demand for specialty container volumes from new and existing customers in february 2015 we announced the introduction of a nextgeneration aluminum bottleshaping technology in our conroe texas facility for a customer under a longterm arrangement that began production in the second quarter of 2015 in april 2015 we announced the construction of a beverage can and end manufacturing facility in monterrey mexico which began production in january 2016 

  

according to publicly available information and company estimates the combined americas metal beverage container industry represents approximately 126 billion units five companies manufacture substantially all of the metal beverage containers in the us and canada and three companies manufacture substantially all such containers in brazil three of these producers and one other independent producer also manufacture metal beverage containers in mexico ball produced approximately 40 billion recyclable aluminum beverage containers in the americas in 2015 — about 34 percent of the aggregate production in these markets sales volumes of metal beverage containers in north america tend to be highest during the period from april through september while in brazil sales volumes tend to be highest from september through december all of the beverage containers produced by ball in the us canada mexico and brazil are made of aluminum as are almost all beverage containers produced by our competitors in those countries in the americas five suppliers provide virtually all our aluminum can and end sheet requirements  

  

metal beverage containers are sold based on price quality service innovation and sustainability in a highly competitive market which is relatively capital intensive and characterized by facilities that run more or less continuously in order to operate profitably in addition the metal beverage container competes aggressively with other packaging materials which include meaningful industry positions by the glass bottle in the packaged beer industry and the polyethylene terephthalate pet bottle in the carbonated soft drink and water industries 

  

we believe we have limited our exposure related to changes in the costs of aluminum ingot as a result of the inclusion of provisions in most metal beverage container sales contracts to pass through aluminum ingot price changes as well as through the use of derivative instruments 

  

in order to better align our manufacturing footprint to meet the needs of our customers in july 2015 the company announced the closure of its bristol virginia metal beverage packaging endmaking facility the facility is expected to cease production in the second quarter of 2016 the bristol facility produces metal beverage ends in a variety of sizes and its capacity will be transitioned to existing north american ball endmaking facilities 

  

asia 

  

the metal beverage container market in the people’s republic of china prc is approximately 36 billion containers of which ball’s operations represented an estimated 18 percent in 2015 our percentage of the industry makes us one of the largest manufacturers of metal beverage containers in the prc with four other manufacturers accounting for an estimated 75 percent of the production our operations include the manufacture of aluminum containers and ends in four facilities in the prc our aluminum can and end sheet requirements are provided by several suppliers 

  

during the first quarter of 2014 the company sold its plastic motor oil container and pail manufacturing business in the prc further details are available in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report additionally in may 2014 we announced the expansion of our asian operations with the construction of a new oneline beverage can manufacturing facility in myanmar which is expected to begin production in the second quarter of 2016 

  

additionally ball operates an equity joint venture in vietnam with thai beverage can limited the joint venture is a leading manufacturer of twopiece aluminum cans and ends for beverages 

  

  

during july 2013 the company signed a compensation agreement with the prc government to close the company’s shenzhen manufacturing facility and relocate the production capacity by the end of 2013 further details are available in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

  

we believe we have limited our exposure related to changes in the costs of aluminum ingot as a result of the inclusion of provisions in most metal beverage container sales contracts to pass through aluminum ingot price changes as well as through the use of derivative instruments 

  

metal beverage packaging europe segment 

  

the european metal beverage container market excluding russia is approximately 60 billion containers and we are the second largest producer with an estimated 30 percent of european shipments the european market is highly regional in terms of sales growth rates and packaging mix 

  

the metal beverage packaging europe segment which accounted for 21 percent of ball’s consolidated net sales in 2015 supplies twopiece metal beverage containers and ends for producers of carbonated soft drinks beer energy drinks and other beverages our european operations consist of 13 facilities — 10 beverage container facilities and three beverage end facilities — of which four are located in germany three in the united kingdom two in france two in poland and one each in the netherlands and serbia in addition ball is currently renting space on the premises of a supplier in haslach germany in order to produce the ball resealable end the european beverage facilities produced approximately 19 billion metal beverage containers in 2015 with approximately 67 percent of those being produced from aluminum and 33 percent from steel seven of the beverage container facilities use aluminum and three use steel during august 2014 we announced the expansion of our beverage can manufacturing facility in oss the netherlands with the construction of a new line for aluminum beverage containers and a new warehouse the new line began commercial production in the second quarter of 2015 

  

sales volumes of metal beverage containers in europe tend to be highest during the period from may through august with a smaller increase in demand leading up to the winter holiday season in the united kingdom much like other parts of the world the metal beverage container competes aggressively with other packaging materials used by the european beer and carbonated soft drink industries the glass bottle is heavily utilized in the packaged beer industry while the pet container is utilized in the carbonated soft drink beer juice and water industries 

  

european raw material supply contracts are generally for a period of one year although ball has negotiated some longer term agreements in europe three aluminum suppliers and two steel suppliers provide 97 percent of our requirements aluminum is traded primarily in us dollars while the functional currencies of the european operations are nonus dollars the company generally tries to minimize the resulting exchange rate risk using derivative and supply contracts in local currencies purchase and sales contracts generally include fixedprice floating or passthrough aluminum ingot component pricing arrangements 

  

metal food and household products packaging segment 

  

the metal food and household products packaging segment accounted for 16 percent of consolidated net sales in 2015 ball produces twopiece and threepiece steel food containers and ends for packaging vegetables fruit soups meat seafood nutritional products pet food and other products the segment also manufactures and sells aerosol paint and general line and decorative specialty containers as well as extruded aluminum aerosol and beverage containers and aluminum slugs there are a total of 13 facilities in the us four in europe one in canada one in mexico and one in india that produce these products in addition the company manufactures and sells steel aerosol containers in two facilities in argentina 

  

during august 2014 we announced the installation of a new extruded aluminum aerosol container line in our deforest wisconsin facility which began production in the first quarter of 2015 additionally in october 2014 we announced the construction of a new extruded aluminum aerosol container manufacturing facility in india which began production in october 2015 in february 2015 we announced the introduction of a new steel aerosol container manufacturing technology in chestnut hill tennessee which began production in the fourth quarter of 2015 also in february 2015 we completed the acquisition of sonoco’s metal end and closure facilities in canton ohio 

  

sales volumes of metal food containers in north america tend to be highest from may through october as a result of seasonal fruit vegetable and salmon packs we estimate our 2015 shipments of approximately 3 billion steel food containers to be approximately 12 percent of total us and canadian metal food container shipments we estimate our steel aerosol business accounts for approximately 35 percent of total annual us and canadian steel aerosol shipments in the us and canada we are the leading supplier of aluminum slugs used in the production of extruded aluminum aerosol 

  

  

containers and estimate our percentage of the total industry shipments to be approximately 92 percent we estimate our extruded aluminum aerosol business accounts for approximately 19 percent of total annual us and canadian extruded aluminum aerosol shipments ball’s european aluminum aerosol shipments represented approximately 21 percent of total european industry shipments in 2015 

  

competitors in the metal food container product line include two national and a small number of regional suppliers and selfmanufacturers several producers in mexico also manufacture steel food containers competition in the us steel aerosol container market primarily includes three other national suppliers steel containers also compete with other packaging materials in the food and household products industry including glass aluminum plastic paper and pouches as a result profitability for this product line is dependent on price cost reduction service and quality in north america two steel suppliers provide approximately 54 percent of our tinplate steel we believe we have limited our exposure related to changes in the costs of steel tinplate and aluminum as a result of the inclusion of provisions in many sales contracts to pass through steel and aluminum cost changes and the existence of certain other steel container sales contracts that incorporate annually negotiated metal costs 

  

cost containment and maximizing asset utilization are crucial to maintaining profitability in the metal food and aerosol container manufacturing industries and ball is focused on doing so toward that end in february 2013 ball announced the closure of its metal food and aerosol container manufacturing facility in elgin illinois the facility which produced aerosol and specialty steel cans as well as flat steel sheet used by other ball food and household products packaging facilities ceased production in the fourth quarter of 2013 and its production capacity was consolidated into other ball facilities ball later announced in november 2013 the closure of its steel aerosol container manufacturing facility in danville illinois the facility ceased production in december 2014 and its production assets were deployed to other north american metal food and household products packaging facilities 

  

aerospace and technologies segment 

  

ball’s aerospace and technologies segment which accounted for 10 percent of consolidated net sales in 2015 includes national defense hardware antenna and video tactical solutions civil and operational space hardware and systems engineering services the segment develops spacecraft sensors and instruments radio frequency systems and other advanced technologies for the civil commercial and national security aerospace markets the majority of the aerospace and technologies business involves work under contracts generally from one to five years in duration as a prime contractor or subcontractor for the us department of defense dod the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and other us government agencies the company competes against both large and small prime contractors and subcontractors for these contracts contracts funded by the various agencies of the federal government represented 96 percent of segment sales in 2015 

  

intense competition and long operating cycles are key characteristics of both the company’s business and the aerospace and defense industry it is common in the aerospace and defense industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to another competitor become a subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting company it is not unusual to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or a customer of that same competitor on other contracts or vice versa 

  

geopolitical events and shifting executive and legislative branch priorities have resulted in an increase in opportunities over the past decade in areas matching our aerospace and technologies segment’s core capabilities in space hardware the businesses include hardware software and services sold primarily to us customers with emphasis on space science and exploration environmental and earth sciences and defense and intelligence applications major activities frequently involve the design manufacture and testing of satellites remote sensors and ground station control hardware and software as well as related services such as launch vehicle integration and satellite operations uncertainties in the federal government budgeting process could delay the funding or even result in cancellation of certain programs currently in our reported backlog 

  

other hardware activities include target identification warning and attitude control systems and components cryogenic systems for reactant storage and associated sensor cooling devices star trackers which are generalpurpose stellar attitude sensors and faststeering mirrors additionally the aerospace and technologies segment provides diversified technical services and products to government agencies prime contractors and commercial organizations for a broad range of information warfare electronic warfare avionics intelligence training and space system needs 

  

backlog in the aerospace and technologies segment was 617 million and 765 million at december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively and consisted of the aggregate contract value of firm orders excluding amounts previously recognized as 

  

  

revenue the 2015 backlog includes 442 million expected to be recognized in revenues during 2016 with the remainder expected to be recognized in revenues in the years thereafter unfunded amounts included in backlog for certain firm government orders which are subject to annual funding were 274 million and 410 million at december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively yearoveryear comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations due to the nature of varying delivery and milestone schedules on contracts funding of programs and the uncertainty of timing of future contract awards 

  

patents 

  

in the opinion of the company’s management none of our active patents or groups of patents is material to the successful operation of our business as a whole we manage our intellectual property portfolio to obtain the durations necessary to achieve our business objectives 

  

research and development 

  

research and development rd efforts in our packaging segments are primarily directed toward packaging innovation specifically the development of new features sizes shapes and types of containers as well as new uses for existing containers other additional rd efforts in these segments seek to improve manufacturing efficiencies and the overall sustainability of our products our packaging rd activities are primarily conducted in technical centers located in westminster colorado and in bonn germany 

  

in our aerospace business we continue to focus our rd activities on the design development and manufacture of innovative aerospace products and systems this includes the production of spacecraft instruments and sensors radio frequency and system components data exploitation solutions and a variety of advanced aerospace technologies and products that enable deep space missions our aerospace rd activities are conducted at various locations in the us

sustainability and the environment 

  

sustainability is a key part of maximizing value at ball in our global operations we focus our sustainability efforts on employee safety and reducing energy water waste and air emissions in addition to those operational priorities we identified innovation packaging recycling talent management responsible sourcing and community engagement as priorities for our corporate sustainability efforts by continuously working toward reducing the environmental impacts of our products throughout their life cycle we also improve our financial results information about our corporate sustainability management goals and performance data are available at wwwballcomsustainability 

  

because metal recycling saves resources and uses up to 20 times less energy than primary metal production the biggest opportunity to further minimize the environmental impacts of metal packaging is to increase recycling rates aluminum and steel are infinitely recyclable materials they also have the highest scrap value of all commonly used packaging substrates contributing to the fact that metal cans are the most recycled food and beverage containers in the world in some of ball’s markets such as brazil china and several european countries recycling rates for beverage cans are at or above 90 percent the most recently available recycling rates in the us are 67 percent for aluminum beverage cans in 2014 and 70 percent for steel containers in 2013 the most recently available recycling rates in europe are approximately 71 percent for aluminum beverage containers and 75 percent for steel packaging in 2013 

  

in several of ball’s markets we help establish and financially support recycling initiatives educating consumers about the benefits of recycling aluminum and steel containers and collaborating with industry partners to create effective collection and recycling systems contribute to increased recycling rates for more details about programs we support please visit wwwballcomrecycling 

  

employee relations 

  

at the end of 2015 the company and its subsidiaries employed approximately 15200 employees 7900 employees in the us and 7300 in other countries details of collective bargaining agreements are included within item 1a risk factors of this annual report

 item 1a risk factors 

  

any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

risks related to the proposed acquisition of rexam 

  

the announced proposed acquisition of rexam is subject to various closing conditions including governmental and regulatory approvals and approval by rexam’s shareholders as well as other uncertainties and there can be no assurances as to whether and when it may be completed failure to consummate the proposed acquisition could negatively impact our stock price and our future business and financial results 

  

the consummation of the announced proposed acquisition of rexam is subject to certain customary conditions a number of the remaining conditions are not within the company’s or rexam’s control and it is possible that such conditions may prevent delay or otherwise materially adversely affect the completion of the acquisition these conditions include among other things i the approval of a courtsanctioned scheme of arrangement under part 26 of the uk companies act by the holders of at least a majority in number representing at least 75 percent of the issued share capital of rexam present at a shareholder meeting approval of related resolutions by at least a 75 percent majority of the issued capital of rexam present at a further shareholder meeting excluding shares held by the company if any and the sanction of the high court of england and wales ii the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 as amended as well as the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the antitrust laws of several other jurisdictions including the european union and brazil and obtaining associated approvals and clearances and iii the absence of a material adverse effect on rexam and certain other actions related to rexam as described in the uk offer announcement 

  

under the uk city code on takeovers and mergers which we refer to as the takeover code we may in certain cases invoke a condition to the acquisition to cause the acquisition not to proceed only if the uk panel on takeovers and mergers which we refer to as the panel is satisfied that the circumstances giving rise to that condition not being satisfied are of material significance to the company in the context of the acquisition because of this panel consent requirement the conditions including as to the absence of a material adverse change affecting rexam may provide us less protection than the customary conditions in an offer for a us domestic company 

  

the company cannot predict with certainty whether and when any of the remaining required conditions will be satisfied or if another uncertainty may arise if the proposed acquisition does not receive or timely receive the required regulatory approvals and clearances or if another event occurs that delays or prevents the acquisition such delay or failure to complete the acquisition and the acquisition process may cause uncertainty or other negative consequences that may materially and adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations and to the extent that the current price of the company’s common stock reflects an assumption that the acquisition will be completed the price per share for the company’s common stock could be negatively impacted 

  

  

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the proposed acquisition of rexam or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected we may also encounter significant unexpected difficulties in integrating the two businesses 

  

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the proposed acquisition of rexam will depend to a large extent on our ability to integrate our business with rexam’s business combining two independent businesses is a complex costly and timeconsuming process as a result we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of the company and rexam the integration process may disrupt the combined business and if implemented ineffectively could preclude the realization of the full benefits of the acquisition that are currently expected our failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the two businesses and to realize the anticipated benefits of the proposed acquisition could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in the activities of the company and could adversely affect the company’s results of operations in addition the overall integration of the businesses may result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses loss of customer relationships and diversion of management’s attention the possible difficulties of combining the operations of the companies also include among others 

  

·   difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings synergies business opportunities and growth prospects from combining our business with that of rexam

·   the loss of key personnel as a result of potentially significant divestitures required in connection with obtaining regulatory clearances

·   difficulties in integrating operations business practices and systems

·   difficulties in assimilating employees

·   difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex combined company

·   challenges in retaining existing customers and suppliers

·   challenges in obtaining new customers and suppliers

·   potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses associated with the proposed acquisition and

·   challenges in retaining and attracting key personnel

  

many of these factors are or will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy which could materially impact the business financial condition and results of operations of the company in addition even if the operations of the businesses of the company and rexam are integrated successfully we may not realize the full benefits of the proposed acquisition including the synergies cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect or the full benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the businesses of the company and rexam all of these factors could adversely affect the earnings of the company decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the proposed acquisition or negatively impact the price of the company’s common stock as a result we cannot assure that the combination of the company and rexam’s businesses will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the proposed acquisition 

  

in order to close the proposed acquisition we will need to incur a significant level of debt that could have important consequences for our business and any investment in our securities 

  

on february 19 2015 the company entered into a £33 billion unsecured bridge loan agreement pursuant to which lending institutions agreed subject to limited conditions to provide financing necessary to pay the cash portion of the consideration payable to rexam shareholders upon consummation of the proposed acquisition of rexam and related fees and expenses in december 2015 the company issued 1 billion of 4375 percent senior notes €400 million of 35 percent senior notes all due in december 2020 and €700 million of 4375 percent senior notes due in december 2023 pursuant to the terms of the unsecured bridge loan agreement the company deposited the net proceeds from the issuance of such notes into escrow accounts from which proceeds would be released subject to certain conditions to pay a portion of the cash consideration payable to rexam shareholders and related fees and expenses which reduced the commitments under the unsecured bridge loan agreement to £19 billion if the company borrows under the bridge loan agreement or otherwise draws upon or incurs indebtedness of this level to close the acquisition such indebtedness could have significant consequences for our business and any investment in our securities including

  

·   increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic industry or competitive developments

·   requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations capital expenditures and future business opportunities and returning cash to our shareholders

·   restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make nonstrategic divestitures

  

  

·   limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures product development debt service requirements acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes and

·   limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged and who therefore may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting

  

issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in connection with the proposed acquisition may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

  

a portion of the funding for the proposed acquisition of rexam is through the issuance of shares of our common stock issuance of shares of our common stock in the proposed acquisition of rexam will dilute the interests of our thenexisting shareholders and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

  

if the proposed acquisition of rexam is not completed we may under certain circumstances be obligated to pay a break payment to rexam of seven percent of the total consideration contemplated to be paid in connection with the proposed acquisition 

  

if the proposed acquisition of rexam is not consummated by august 19 2016 unless extended by mutual agreement because certain regulatory approvals that are conditions to the acquisition have not been obtained or waived by the company the company would be required to pay rexam a break payment of seven percent of the total consideration contemplated to be paid in connection with the proposed acquisition any break payment that the company may be required to pay may require the company to use available cash that would have otherwise been available for general corporate purposes and other matters for these and other reasons a failed acquisition could materially and adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations and the price per share of the company’s common stock 

  

in order to obtain regulatory clearance for the proposed acquisition of rexam we expect to be required to commit to and effect significant divestitures which could negatively impact our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the proposed acquisition of rexam or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us 

  

in connection with satisfying requirements under the antitrust laws of the united states and several other jurisdictions including the european union and brazil and obtaining associated approvals and clearances we expect to be required to commit to significant divestitures the terms of the recommended offer as set forth in the uk offer announcement and the cooperation agreement require us to consummate the proposed acquisition of rexam even if certain regulators require significant divestitures that would not be accepted as sufficiently material to the company in the context of the proposed acquisition of rexam to permit the offer to lapse in addition the relevant regulatory authorities may determine that in order to close the rexam acquisition the company must commit to divestitures at a level in excess of the amount that would allow the company to permit the offer to lapse but the company may nonetheless decide to complete the proposed acquisition as a result of any required divestitures and the risks related to the divestiture process we may not realize all or a significant portion of the anticipated benefits of the proposed rexam acquisition including anticipated synergies and the company may otherwise suffer other negative consequences that may materially and adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations and to the extent that the current price of the company’s common stock reflects an assumption that the anticipated benefits of the proposed acquisition will be realized the price per share for the company’s common stock could be negatively impacted 

  

shareholders in the combined consolidated company will be more exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations as following completion of the acquisition there will be an increased proportion of assets liabilities and earnings denominated in foreign currencies 

  

as a result of the acquisition of rexam the financial results of the combined company will be more exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations and an increased proportion of assets liabilities and earnings will be denominated in nonus dollar currencies the combined company will present its financial statements in us dollars and will have a significant proportion of net assets and income in nonus dollar currencies primarily the euro as well as pounds sterling and a range of emerging market currencies the combined company’s financial results and capital ratios will therefore be sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates a depreciation of nonus dollar currencies relative to the us dollar could have an adverse impact on the combined company’s financial results 

  

  

the takeover code restricts our ability to cause rexam to consummate the acquisition and limits the relief ball may obtain in the event rexam’s board of directors withdraws its support for the acquisition 

  

the takeover code limits the contractual commitments that may be obtained from rexam to take actions in furtherance of the acquisition and rexam’s board of directors may if its fiduciary and other directors’ duties so require withdraw its recommendation in support for the acquisition and withdraw the scheme of arrangement at any time prior to the scheme of arrangement becoming effective the takeover code does not permit rexam to pay any break fee to the company if it does so nor can it be subject to any restrictions on soliciting or negotiating other offers or transactions involving rexam other than the restrictions that arise under the takeover code against undertaking actions or entering into agreements which might frustrate the company’s takeover offer for rexam 

  

our business operating results and financial condition are subject to particular risks in certain regions of the world 

  

we may experience an operating loss in one or more regions of the world for one or more periods which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition moreover overcapacity which often leads to lower prices exists in a number of the regions in which we operate and may persist even if demand grows our ability to manage such operational fluctuations and to maintain adequate longterm strategies in the face of such developments will be critical to our continued growth and profitability 

  

there can be no assurance that the company’s business acquisitions will be successfully integrated into the acquiring company see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report for details 

  

while we have what we believe to be well designed integration plans if we cannot successfully integrate the acquired operations with those of ball we may experience material negative consequences to our business financial condition or results of operations the integration of companies that have previously been operated separately involves a number of risks including but not limited to 

  

·   demands on management related to the increase in our size after the acquisition

·   the diversion of management’s attention from the management of existing operations to the integration of the acquired operations

·   difficulties in the assimilation and retention of employees

·   difficulties in the integration of departments systems including financial systems technologies books and records and procedures as well as in maintaining uniform standards controls including internal accounting controls procedures and policies

·   expenses related to any undisclosed or potential liabilities and

·   retention of major customers and suppliers

  

we may not be able to achieve potential synergies or maintain the levels of revenue earnings or operating efficiency that each business had achieved or might achieve separately the successful integration of the acquired operations will depend on our ability to manage those operations realize revenue opportunities and to some degree eliminate redundant and excess costs 

  

the loss of a key customer or a reduction in its requirements could have a significant negative impact on our sales 

  

we sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major beverage packaged food personal care and household product companies some of which operate in north america south america europe and asia 

  

although the majority of our customer contracts are longterm these contracts unless they are renewed expire in accordance with their respective terms and are terminable under certain circumstances such as our failure to meet quality volume or market pricing requirements because we depend on relatively few major customers our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss of any of these customers a reduction in the purchasing levels of these customers a strike or work stoppage by a significant number of these customers’ employees or an adverse change in the terms of the supply agreements with these customers 

  

the primary customers for our aerospace segment are us government agencies or their prime contractors our contracts with these customers are subject to several risks including funding cuts and delays technical uncertainties budget changes competitive activity and changes in scope 

  

  

we face competitive risks from many sources that may negatively impact our profitability 

  

competition within the packaging and aerospace industries is intense increases in productivity combined with existing or potential surplus capacity in the industry have maintained competitive pricing pressures the principal methods of competition in the general packaging industry are price innovation sustainability service and quality in the aerospace industry they are technical capability cost and schedule some of our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources and some may currently have significant excess capacity our current or potential competitors may offer products at a lower price or products that are deemed superior to ours the global economic environment has resulted in reductions in demand for our products in some instances which in turn could increase these competitive pressures 

  

we are subject to competition from alternative products which could result in lower profits and reduced cash flows 

  

our metal packaging products are subject to significant competition from substitute products particularly plastic carbonated soft drink bottles made from pet single serve beer bottles and other food and beverage containers made of glass cardboard or other materials competition from plastic carbonated soft drink bottles is particularly intense in the us europe and the prc certain of our aerospace products are also subject to competition from alternative products and solutions there can be no assurance that our products will successfully compete against alternative products which could result in a reduction in our profits or cash flow 

  

our packaging businesses have a narrow product range and our business would suffer if usage of our products decreased or if decreases occur in the demand for the beverages food and other goods filled in our products 

  

for the year ended december 31 2015 74 percent of our consolidated net sales were from the sale of metal beverage containers and we expect to derive a significant portion of our future revenues and cash flows from the sale of metal beverage containers our business would suffer if the use of metal beverage containers decreased accordingly broad acceptance by consumers of aluminum and steel containers for a wide variety of beverages is critical to our future success if demand for glass and pet bottles increases relative to metal containers the demand for aluminum and steel containers does not develop as expected or declines in consumption of carbonated soft drinks in north america continue our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

  

changes in laws and governmental regulations may adversely affect our business and operations 

  

we and our customers and suppliers are subject to various federal state provincial and local laws and regulations which are increasing in number and complexity each of our and their facilities is subject to federal state provincial and local licensing and regulation by health environmental workplace safety and other agencies in multiple jurisdictions requirements of worldwide governmental authorities with respect to manufacturing manufacturing facility locations within the jurisdiction product content and safety climate change workplace safety and health environmental expropriation of assets and other standards could adversely affect our ability to manufacture or sell our products and the ability of our customers and suppliers to manufacture and sell their products in addition we face risks arising from compliance with and enforcement of increasingly numerous and complex federal state provincial and local laws and regulations 

  

enacted regulatory developments regarding the reporting and use of “conflict minerals” mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries could affect the sourcing availability and price of minerals used in the manufacture of certain of our products as a result there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflictfree materials and we cannot give assurance that we will be able to obtain such products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices also because our supply chains are complex we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of all materials used in the products that we sell the compliance and reporting aspects of these regulations may result in incremental costs to the company while deposit systems and other containerrelated legislation have been adopted in some jurisdictions similar legislation has been defeated in public referenda and legislative bodies in many others we anticipate that continuing efforts will be made to consider and adopt such legislation in the future the packages we produce are widely used and perform well in us states canadian provinces and european countries that have deposit systems as well as in other countries worldwide 

  

significant environmental employmentrelated and other legislation and regulatory requirements exist and are also evolving the compliance costs associated with current and proposed laws and potential regulations could be substantial and any failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws or regulations could lead to litigation or governmental action all of which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

  

  

our business financial condition and results of operations are subject to risks resulting from broader geographic operations 

  

we derived approximately 41 percent of our consolidated net sales from outside of the us for the year ended december 31 2015 the sizeable scope of operations outside of the us may lead to more volatile financial results and make it more difficult for us to manage our business reasons for this include but are not limited to the following 

  

·   political and economic instability

·   governments’ restrictive trade policies

·   the imposition or rescission of duties taxes or government royalties

·   exchange rate risks

·   difficulties in enforcement of contractual obligations and intellectual property rights and

·   the geographic language and cultural differences between personnel in different areas of the world

  

any of these factors many of which are also present in the us could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

we are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations 

  

our reporting currency is the us dollar a portion of ball’s operations including assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses have been denominated in various transaction currencies other than the us dollar and we expect such operations will continue to be so denominated as a result the us dollar value of these operations has varied and will continue to vary with exchange rate fluctuations a decrease in the value of the various currencies compared to the us dollar could reduce our profits from these operations and the value of their net assets when reported in us dollars in our financial statements this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations as reported in us dollars in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to currencies in which the earnings are generated may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations 

  

we manage our exposure to currency fluctuations particularly our exposure to fluctuations in the euro to us dollar exchange rate to attempt to mitigate the effect of cash flow and earnings volatility associated with exchange rate changes we primarily use forward contracts and options to manage our currency exposures and as a result we experience gains and losses on these derivative positions offset in part by the impact of currency fluctuations on existing assets and liabilities our inability to properly manage our exposure to currency fluctuations could materially impact our results 

  

if we fail to retain key management and personnel we may be unable to implement our key objectives 

  

we believe that our future success depends in part on our experienced management team unforeseen losses of key members of our management team without appropriate succession andor compensation planning could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet our objectives 

  

decreases in our ability to apply new technology and knowhow may affect our competitiveness 

  

our success depends partially on our ability to improve production processes and services we must also introduce new products and services to meet changing customer needs if we are unable to implement better production processes or to develop new products through research and development or licensing of new technology we may not be able to remain competitive with other manufacturers as a result our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

adverse weather and climate changes may result in lower sales 

  

we manufacture packaging products primarily for beverages and foods unseasonably cool weather can reduce demand for certain beverages packaged in our containers in addition poor weather conditions or changes in climate that reduce crop yields of fruits and vegetables can adversely affect demand for our food containers climate change could have various effects on the demand for our products in different regions around the world 

  

  

we are vulnerable to fluctuations in the supply and price of raw materials 

  

we purchase aluminum steel and other raw materials and packaging supplies from several sources while all such materials are available from independent suppliers raw materials are subject to fluctuations in price and availability attributable to a number of factors including general economic conditions commodity price fluctuations particularly aluminum on the london metal exchange the demand by other industries for the same raw materials and the availability of complementary and substitute materials although we enter into commodities purchase agreements from time to time and sometimes use derivative instruments to seek to manage our risk we cannot ensure that our current suppliers of raw materials will be able to supply us with sufficient quantities at reasonable prices economic and financial factors could impact our suppliers thereby causing supply shortages increases in raw material costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in the americas europe and asia some contracts do not allow us to pass along increased raw material costs and we generally use derivative agreements to seek to manage this risk our hedging procedures may be insufficient and our results could be materially impacted if costs of materials increase due to the fixedprice contracts and derivative activities while increasing raw material costs may not impact our nearterm profitability increased prices could decrease our sales volume over time 

  

prolonged work stoppages at facilities with union employees could jeopardize our financial position 

  

as of december 31 2015 approximately 27 percent of our north american packaging facility employees and approximately 63 percent of our european employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements these collective bargaining agreements have staggered expirations during the next several years although we consider our employee relations to be generally good a prolonged work stoppage or strike at any facility with union employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition we cannot ensure that upon the expiration of existing collective bargaining agreements new agreements will be reached without union action or that any such new agreements will be on terms satisfactory to us 

  

our aerospace and technologies segment is subject to certain risks specific to that business 

  

in our aerospace business us government contracts are subject to reduction or modification in the event of changes in requirements and the government may also terminate contracts at its convenience pursuant to standard termination provisions in such instances ball may be entitled to reimbursement for allowable costs and profits on authorized work that has been performed through the date of termination 

  

in addition budgetary constraints may result in further reductions to projected spending levels by the us government in particular government expenditures are subject to the potential for automatic reductions generally referred to as “sequestration” sequestration may occur in any given year resulting in significant additional reductions to spending by various us government defense and aerospace agencies on both existing and new contracts as well as the disruption of ongoing programs even if sequestration does not occur we expect that budgetary constraints and ongoing concerns regarding the us national debt will continue to place downward pressure on agency spending levels due to these and other factors overall spending on various programs could decline which could result in significant reductions to revenue cash flows net earnings and backlog primarily in our aerospace and technologies segment 

  

we use estimates in accounting for many of our programs in our aerospace business and changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results 

  

we account for sales and profits on some longterm contracts in our aerospace business in accordance with the percentageofcompletion method of accounting using the cumulative catchup method to account for updates in estimates the percentageofcompletion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project revenues and costs at completion and various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events including the quantity and timing of product deliveries future labor performance and rates and material and overhead costs these assumptions involve various levels of expected performance improvements under the cumulative catchup method the impact of updates in our estimates related to units shipped to date is recognized immediately 

  

because of the significance of the judgments and estimates described above it is likely that we could record materially different amounts if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances or estimates were to change accordingly updates in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates may materially affect our future financial performance 

  

our backlog includes both costtype and fixedprice contracts costtype contracts generally have lower profit margins than fixedprice contracts our earnings and margins may vary depending on the types of government contracts undertaken the nature of the work performed under those contracts the costs incurred in performing the work the achievement of other performance objectives and their impact on our ability to receive fees 

  

  

as a us government contractor we could be adversely affected by changes in regulations or any negative findings from a us government audit or investigation 

  

our aerospace business operates in a highly regulated environment and is routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its agencies such as the defense contract audit agency dcaa and defense contract management agency dcma these agencies review performance under our contracts our cost structure and our compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies business systems that are subject to review under the dod federal acquisition regulation supplement dfars are purchasing estimating material management and accounting as well as property and earned value management any costs ultimately found to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if already reimbursed if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties sanctions or suspension or debarment from doing business with the us government whether or not illegal activities are alleged the us government also has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate if such actions were to result in suspension or debarment this could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

our business is subject to substantial environmental remediation and compliance costs 

  

our operations are subject to federal state provincial and local laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions relating to environmental hazards such as emissions to air discharges to water the handling and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes and the cleanup of hazardous substances we have been designated along with numerous other companies as a potentially responsible party for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites based on available information we do not believe that any costs incurred in connection with such sites will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations capital expenditures or competitive position there is increased focus on the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental issues worldwide 

  

our business faces the potential of increased regulation on some of the raw materials utilized in our packaging operations 

  

our operations are subject to federal state provincial and local laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions relating to some of the raw materials such as epoxybased coatings utilized in our container making process epoxybased coatings may contain bisphenola bpa scientific evidence evaluated by regulatory agencies in the united states canada europe japan australia and new zealand has consistently shown these coatings to be safe for food contact at current levels and these regulatory agencies have stated that human exposure to bpa from epoxybased container coatings is well below safe exposure limits set by government bodies worldwide a significant change in these regulatory agency statements adverse information concerning bpa or rulings made within certain federal state provincial and local jurisdictions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations ball recognizes that significant interest exists in nonepoxy based coatings and we have been proactively working with coatings suppliers and our customers to evaluate alternatives to current coatings 

  

net earnings and net worth could be materially affected by an impairment of goodwill 

  

we have a significant amount of goodwill recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2015 we are required at least annually to test the recoverability of goodwill the recoverability test of goodwill is based on the current fair value of our identified reporting units fair value measurement requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors including revenue and market growth operating cash flows and discount rates if general market conditions deteriorate in portions of our business we could experience a significant decline in the fair value of reporting units this decline could lead to an impairment of all or a significant portion of the goodwill balance which could materially affect our us gaap net earnings and net worth we continue to see the industry supply of metal beverage packaging exceed demand in china resulting in significant pricing pressure and negative impacts on the profitability of our metal beverage packaging asia reporting unit if it becomes an expectation that this situation will continue for an extended period of time it may result in a noncash impairment of some or all of the goodwill associated with this reporting unit totaling 783 million at december 31 2015 the company’s annual goodwill impairment test completed in the fourth quarter of 2015 indicated the estimated fair value of the metal beverage packaging asia reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount including goodwill by approximately 25 percent 

  

  

if the investments in ball’s pension plans or in the multiemployer pension plans in which ball participates do not perform as expected we may have to contribute additional amounts to the plans which would otherwise be available to cover operating expenses and fund growth opportunities 

  

ball maintains defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of its north american and united kingdom employees which are funded based on certain actuarial assumptions the plans’ assets consist primarily of common stocks fixedincome securities and in the us alternative investments market declines longevity increases or legislative changes such as the pension protection act in the us could result in a prospective decrease in our available cash flow and net earnings over time and the recognition of an increase in our pension obligations could result in a reduction to our shareholders’ equity additional risks exist related to the company’s participation in multiemployer pension plans assets contributed to a multiemployer pension plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers if a participating employer in a multiemployer pension plan stops contributing to the plan the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participants this could result in increases to our contributions to the plans as well as pension expense 

  

restricted access to capital markets could adversely affect our shortterm liquidity and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the notes issued pursuant to our bond indentures 

  

a reduction in global market liquidity could 

  

·   restrict our ability to fund working capital capital expenditures research and development expenditures and other business activities

·   increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions including the credit risks stemming from the economic environment

·   limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate

·   restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities and

·   limit along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt among other things our ability to borrow additional funds dispose of assets pay cash dividends or refinance debt maturities

  

if market interest rates increase our variablerate debt will create higher debt service requirements which would adversely affect our cash flow while we sometimes enter into agreements limiting our exposure any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk 

  

the global credit financial and economic environment could have a negative impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

the overall credit financial and economic environment could have significant negative effects on our operations including 

  

·   the creditworthiness of customers suppliers and counterparties could deteriorate resulting in a financial loss or a disruption in our supply of raw materials

·   volatile market performance could affect the fair value of our pension assets potentially requiring us to make significant additional contributions to our defined benefit plans to maintain prescribed funding levels

·   a significant weakening of our financial position or operating results could result in noncompliance with our debt covenants and

·   reduced cash flow from our operations could adversely affect our ability to execute our longterm strategy to increase liquidity reduce debt repurchase our stock and invest in our businesses

  

changes in us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap and securities and exchange commission sec rules and regulations could materially impact our reported results 

  

us gaap and sec accounting and reporting changes are common and have become more frequent and significant over the past several years furthermore the us and international accounting standard setters are in the process of jointly converging several key accounting standards these changes could have significant effects on our reported results when compared to prior periods and other companies and may even require us to retrospectively adjust prior periods additionally material changes to the presentation of transactions in the consolidated financial statements could impact key ratios that analysts and credit rating agencies use to rate ball and ultimately our ability to access the credit markets in an efficient manner 

  

  

earnings and cash flows can be impacted by changes in tax laws 

  

as a usbased multinational business the company is subject to income tax in the us and numerous jurisdictions outside the us the relevant tax rules and regulations are complex often changing and in some cases are interdependent for example certain income that is earned and taxed in countries outside the us is not taxable in the us until those earnings are actually repatriated or deemed repatriated if these or other tax rules and regulations should change the company’s earnings and cash flows could be impacted 

  

the company’s worldwide provision for income taxes is determined in part through the use of significant estimates and judgment numerous transactions arise in the ordinary course of business where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain the company undergoes tax examinations by various worldwide tax authorities on a regular basis while the company believes its estimates of its tax obligations are reasonable the final outcome after the conclusion of any tax examinations and any litigation could be materially different from what has been reflected in the company’s historical financial statements 

  

increased information technology it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems networks products solutions and services 

  

increased global it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including employee training comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems networks products solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats depending on their nature and scope such threats could potentially lead to the compromise of confidential information improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which in turn could adversely affect our reputation competitiveness and results of operations

management’s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k which include additional information about our accounting policies practices and the transactions underlying our financial results the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes including various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits taxes environmental and other matters arising during the normal course of business we apply our best judgment our knowledge of existing facts and circumstances and actions that we may undertake in the future in determining the estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances such as current economic conditions and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change as future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision actual results may differ from these estimates ball corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as “ball corporation” “ball” “the company” or “we” or “our” in the following discussion and analysis 

  

overview 

  

business overview and industry trends 

  

ball corporation is one of the world’s leading suppliers of metal packaging to the beverage food personal care and household products industries our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses are manufactured in facilities around the world and are competitive with other substrates such as plastics and glass in the rigid packaging industry sales and earnings can be increased by reducing costs increasing prices developing new products expanding volumes and making strategic acquisitions we also provide aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers 

  

we sell our packaging products mainly to large multinational beverage food personal care and household products companies with which we have developed longterm customer relationships this is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of longterm supply contracts while we have a diversified customer base we sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major companies in north america europe asia and south america as do our equity joint ventures in the us and vietnam the overall metal container industry is growing globally and is expected to continue to grow in the medium to long term despite the north american industry seeing a continued decline in standardsized aluminum beverage packaging for the carbonated soft drink market the primary customers for the products and services provided by our aerospace and technologies segment are us government agencies or their prime contractors 

  

we purchase our raw materials from relatively few suppliers we also have exposure to inflation in particular the rising costs of raw materials as well as other direct cost inputs we mitigate our exposure to the changes in the costs of metal through the inclusion of provisions in contracts covering the majority of our volumes to pass through metal price changes as well as through the use of derivative instruments the passthrough provisions generally result in proportional increases or decreases in sales and costs with a greatly reduced impact if any on net earnings because of our customer and supplier concentration our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss insolvency or bankruptcy of a major customer or supplier or a change in a supply agreement with a major customer or supplier although our contract provisions generally mitigate the risk of customer loss and our longterm relationships represent a known stable customer base 

  

we recognize sales under longterm contracts in the aerospace and technologies segment using percentageofcompletion under the costtocost method of accounting throughout the period of contract performance we regularly reevaluate and if necessary revise our estimates of aerospace and technologies total contract revenue total contract cost and progress toward completion because of contract payment schedules limitations on funding and other contract terms our sales and accounts receivable for this segment include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed 

  

  

corporate strategy 

  

our drive for 10 vision encompasses five strategic levers that are key to growing our business and achieving longterm success since launching drive for 10 in 2011 we made progress on each of the levers as follows 

  

·   maximizing value in our existing businesses by rationalizing standard beverage container and end capacity in north america and expanding specialty container production to meet current demand leveraging plant floor systems in our metal beverage facilities to improve efficiencies and reduce costs consolidating andor closing multiple metal beverage and metal food and aerosol packaging facilities to gain business customer and supplier efficiencies and implementing costout and valuein initiatives across all of our businesses

  

·   expanding further into new products and capabilities by expanding into extruded aluminum aerosol manufacturing with the installation of a new extruded aluminum aerosol line in our deforest wisconsin facility during 2014 the acquisition of sonoco’s metal end and closure manufacturing facilities in canton ohio in february 2015 the installation of new extruded aluminum aerosol lines in our devizes united kingdom and czech republic facilities and successfully commercializing extruded aluminum aerosol packaging that utilizes a significant amount of recycled material

  

·   aligning ourselves with the right customers and markets by investing capital to meet doubledigit volume growth for specialty beverage containers throughout our global network which now represent approximately 29 percent of our global beverage packaging mix successfully commercialized the next generation aluminum bottleshaping technology in conroe texas for a customer under a longterm arrangement and the construction of a metal beverage container facility in monterrey mexico producing cans and ends

  

·   broadening our geographic reach with new investments in a metal beverage manufacturing facility in myanmar as well as an extruded aluminum aerosol manufacturing facility in india and the construction of a metal beverage container facility in monterrey mexico producing cans and ends and

  

·   leveraging our technological expertise in packaging innovation including the introduction of nextgeneration aluminum bottleshaping technologies including the introduction of a new two piece lightweight steel aerosol can g3 technology in our chestnut hill tennessee facility in december 2015 and pursuing opportunities to further enhance our aerospace technical expertise across a broader customer portfolio

  

these ongoing business developments help us stay close to our customers while expanding andor sustaining our industry positions with major beverage food personal care household products and aerospace customers 

  

results of operations 

  

consolidated sales and earnings 

  

   

the decrease in net sales in 2015 compared to 2014 was due to unfavorable foreign currency effects in europe lower metal food container sales volumes due to a customer shift in north american steel food containers and unfavorable pricing in the prc partially offset by higher beverage segment sales volumes net earnings were lower in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower sales unfavorable currency effects higher business consolidation and other activities and higher debt refinancing and other costs partially offset by a lower tax rate in 2015 and cost reduction efforts by all business segments 

  

the increased business consolidation and other activities in 2015 compared to 2014 included collar and option contract losses crosscurrency swap fair value changes net currency exchange losses on the restricted cash and debt associated with the proposed rexam acquisition and transaction costs related to the proposed acquisition of rexam the collar and option contracts as well as the crosscurrency swap are not accounted for as hedges see note 5 and 19 located in item 8 of this annual report for additional information on financial instruments 

  

the increased debt refinancing and other costs in 2015 compared to 2014 included mark to market losses on derivative 

  

  

financial instruments designed to mitigate exposure to interest rates changes for debt issuances related to the proposed rexam acquisition the writeoff of unamortized deferred financing charges for the partial extinguishment of the committed bridge loan agreement and the revolving credit facility interest expense on newly issued 35 percent and 4375 percent senior notes planned to fund a portion of the purchase price of the proposed rexam acquisition amortization of deferred financing costs for the committed bridge loan agreement and the redemption of the 675 percent and 575 percent senior notes see note 13 and 19 located in item 8 of this annual report for additional information on financial instruments 

  

the increase in net sales in 2014 compared to 2013 was due primarily to higher metal beverage container sales volumes and higher aerospace program revenues partially offset by lower north american food and household product volumes net earnings were favorably impacted by higher metal beverage container sales volumes lower cost of sales as a percentage of net sales lower depreciation expense lower interest expense and a lower tax rate in 2014 partially offset by lower north american food and household product volumes unfavorable tinplate service center manufacturing performance in the us higher debt refinancing costs and higher selling general and administrative costs in 2014 

  

cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization 

  

cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization was 64603 million in 2015 compared to 69035 million in 2014 and 68754 million in 2013 these amounts represented 808 percent 806 percent and 812 percent of consolidated net sales for those three years respectively 

  

depreciation and amortization 

  

depreciation and amortization expense was 2855 million in 2015 compared to 2809 million in 2014 and 2999 million in 2013 these amounts represented 36 percent 33 percent and 35 percent of consolidated net sales for those three years respectively lower expense in 2014 compared to 2013 was largely due to the completion of depreciation for certain acquired european assets 

  

selling general and administrative 

  

selling general and administrative sga expenses were 4513 million in 2015 compared to 4665 million in 2014 and 4186 million in 2013 these amounts represented 56 percent 54 percent and 49 percent of consolidated net sales for those three years respectively the decrease in sga expenses in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to lower incentive compensation and net favorable foreign currency effects in sga partially offset by deferred compensation expense related to director retirements the increase in sga in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to higher incentive compensation and employee benefit costs and other individually insignificant higher costs 

  

interest expense 

  

total interest expense was 2597 million in 2015 compared to 1930 million in 2014 and 2118 million in 2013 excluding debt refinancing and other costs interest expense in 2015 was lower compared to 2014 due to lower interest rates on newly issued longterm debt and the retirement of higher interest rate longterm debt excluding debt refinancing and other costs interest expense in 2014 was lower than in 2013 due primarily to lower average debt levels and lower average borrowing rates interest expense excluding the effect of debt refinancing costs as a percentage of average monthly borrowings was 43 percent in 2015 48 percent in 2014 and 51 percent in 2013 

  

debt refinancing and other costs were 1165 million for the year ended december 31 2015 these costs consisted of 1 fair value changes on derivative instruments designed to mitigate risks of interest rate changes with anticipated debt issuances for a portion of the cash consideration payable in the proposed acquisition of rexam 2 the amortization of deferred financing fees on the unsecured committed bridge loan agreement 3 writeoffs of unamortized deferred financing fees and the premium paid for the redemption of previously issued senior credit facilities the partial extinguishment of the committed bridge loan agreement and the partial extinguishment of the revolving credit facility 4 the refinance of senior credit facilities and 5 interest expense on senior notes issued in december 2015 to fund a portion of the cash consideration of the proposed rexam acquisition see note 19 in item 8 of this annual report for additional information on these instruments and the transactions flowing through debt refinancing and other costs 

  

  

tax provision 

  

the effective income tax rate for earnings from continuing operations was 136 percent in 2015 compared to 232 percent in 2014 and 256 percent in 2013 the lower tax rate in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to business consolidation costs incurred in the us lower us taxes on foreign earnings and increased research and development tax credits partially offset by decreased favorable nonrecurring discrete tax items in the 2015 effective tax rate the lower tax rate in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily the result of a higher foreign tax rate differential lower us taxes on foreign earnings and the 2014 releases of uncertain tax positions which exceeded those occurring in 2013 

  

results of business segments 

  

ball’s operations are organized and reviewed by management along its product lines and geographical areas and presented in the four reportable segments discussed below 

  

metal beverage packaging americas and asia 

  

   

a   further details of these items are included in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

  

the metal beverage packaging americas and asia segment consists of operations located in the us canada brazil and the prc which manufacture aluminum containers used in beverage packaging 

  

in april 2015 we announced the construction of a metal beverage manufacturing facility in monterrey mexico which began production of cans and ends in january 2016 during the first quarter of 2015 we announced the introduction of a nextgeneration aluminum bottleshaping technology in our conroe texas facility additionally in may 2014 we announced the expansion of our asian operations with the construction of a new beverage can manufacturing facility in myanmar which is expected to begin production in the first half of 2016 

  

segment sales in 2015 were relatively unchanged from 2014 as higher sales volumes in the americas and the prc were offset by unfavorable pricing in the prc segment earnings in 2015 were 239 million lower compared to 2014 due primarily to unfavorable pricing in the prc 

  

segment sales in 2014 were 534 million higher compared to 2013 due primarily to 101 million higher sales volumes offset by a reduction in the pass through price of aluminum segment earnings in 2014 were 224 million higher than in 2013 due to 36 million from higher sales volumes partially offset by higher incentive compensation and other individually insignificant costs 

  

the current industry supply of metal beverage packaging exceeds demand in the prc resulting in pricing pressure and negative impacts on the profitability of our beverage asia reporting unit if it becomes an expectation that this market oversupply situation will continue for an extended period of time the company may be required to record a noncash impairment charge for some or all of the goodwill associated with the beverage asia reporting unit the total balance of which was 783 million at december 31 2015 

  

  

metal beverage packaging europe 

  

   

a further details of these items are included in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report

segment sales in 2015 were 2436 million lower compared to 2014 due primarily to unfavorable currency exchange effects of 359 million partially offset by favorable product mix and higher sales volumes segment earnings in 2015 were 306 million lower compared to 2014 due primarily to unfavorable currency exchange effects of 56 million and unfavorable manufacturing performance due to new line startups partially offset by favorable sales mix and higher sales volumes 

  

segment sales in 2014 increased 680 million compared to 2013 due primarily to higher sales volumes and favorable product mix of 56 million and favorable currency exchange effects of 12 million segment earnings in 2014 increased 403 million compared to 2013 due primarily to higher sales volumes and favorable product mix of 62 million and reduced depreciation costs of 26 million partially offset by higher incentive compensation and employee costs 

  

metal food and household products packaging 

  

   

a   further details of these items are included in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

  

the metal food and household products packaging segment consists of operations located in the us europe canada mexico argentina and india that manufacture metal food aerosol paint general line and extruded aluminum containers as well as decorative specialty containers and aluminum slugs 

  

during august 2014 we announced the installation of a new extruded aluminum aerosol can line in our deforest wisconsin facility which began production in the first half of 2015 additionally in october 2014 we announced the construction of a new extruded aluminum aerosol can manufacturing facility in india which began production in the second half of 2015 in february 2015 we announced the introduction of a new twopiece steel aerosol container manufacturing technology in chestnut hill tennessee which was implemented in 2015

  

  

segment sales in 2015 were 2078 million lower compared to 2014 due primarily to lower metal food container sales volumes of 260 million mainly related to a customer shift effective january 2015 and unfavorable currency exchange effects of 37 million partially offset by favorable product mix of 90 million segment earnings in 2015 decreased 465 million compared to 2014 due primarily to earnings impacts from lower sales volumes unfavorable currency exchange effects unfavorable startup costs partially offset by extruded aluminum aerosol growth in europe the earnings from the sonoco acquisition and reduced selling general and administrative costs 

  

segment sales in 2014 decreased 542 million compared to 2013 due primarily to lower metal food container sales volumes segment earnings in 2014 decreased 232 million compared to 2013 due primarily to lower sales volumes and unfavorable tinplate service center manufacturing performance in the us 

  

aerospace and technologies 

  

   

a   further details of these items are included in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

  

the aerospace and technologies segment consists of the manufacture and sale of aerospace and other related products and services provided for the defense civil space and commercial space industries 

  

segment sales in 2015 decreased 1247 million compared to 2014 primarily due to lower sales from us national defense contracts segment earnings in 2015 decreased 118 million compared to 2014 due to lower sales favorable program performance in 2014 from program and contract completions and increased recovery of pension costs in 2014 

  

segment sales in 2014 increased 377 million compared to 2013 due to higher sales for civil space contracts and us national defense contracts segment earnings in 2014 increased 135 million primarily as a result of favorable program execution and increased recovery of pension costs 

  

sales to the us government either directly as a prime contractor or indirectly as a subcontractor represented 96 percent of segment sales in 2015 compared to 95 percent of segment sales in 2014 and 94 percent in 2013 the aerospace and technologies contract mix in 2015 consisted of 54 percent costtype contracts which are billed at our costs plus an agreed upon andor earned profit component and 43 percent fixedprice contracts 

  

contracted backlog for the aerospace and technologies segment at december 31 2015 and 2014 was 617 million and 765 million respectively the yearoveryear decline reflects the successful completion of several multiyear contracts the segment has numerous outstanding bids for future contract awards comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations due to the nature of varying delivery and milestone schedules on contracts funding of programs and the uncertainty of timing of future contract awards 

  

additional segment information 

  

for additional information regarding our segments see the business segment information in note 3 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report the charges recorded for business consolidation and other activities were based on estimates by ball management and were developed from information available at the time if actual outcomes vary from the estimates the differences will be reflected in current period earnings in the consolidated statement of earnings and identified as business consolidation gains and losses additional details about our business consolidation and other activities are provided in note 5 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

  

  

critical and significant accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements 

  

for information regarding the company’s critical and significant accounting policies as well as recent accounting pronouncements see notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

  

subsequent events 

  

in january 2016 the company announced that its aerospace and technologies segment had acquired specialized engineering cyber firm wavefront technologies this acquisition is not material to the company 

  

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

  

cash flows and capital expenditures 

  

our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities and external committed borrowings we believe that cash flows from operations and cash provided by shortterm longterm and committed revolver borrowings when necessary will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements scheduled principal and interest payments on debt dividend payments proposed acquisitions including the announced proposed acquisition of rexam and anticipated capital expenditures the following summarizes our cash flows 

  

   

cash flows from operations in 2015 were comparable to 2014 as lower pension contributions were offset by lower net earnings lower cash inflows from working capital and cash paid for transaction costs for the proposed acquisition of rexam the working capital changes were primarily related to slightly higher days sales outstanding partially offset by lower inventory volumes and higher days payable outstanding days sales outstanding increased from 34 days to 35 days inventory days on hand decreased from 52 days to 49 days and days payable outstanding increased from 69 days to 82 days the increase in days payables outstanding is primarily due to renegotiation of payment terms in supplier contracts in north america 

  

cash flows from operations in 2014 improved compared to 2013 due to higher net earnings and favorable working capital changes the favorable working capital changes were primarily related to lower days sales outstanding lower inventory days on hand and higher days payable outstanding days sales outstanding decreased from 36 days to 34 days due to greater factoring of accounts receivables inventory days on hand decreased from 53 days to 52 days due to the negotiation of longer payment terms with suppliers days payable outstanding increased from 51 days to 69 days 

  

during the year ended december 31 2015 the company entered into collar and option contracts to reduce exposure to currency exchange rate changes in connection with the british pound denominated cash portion of the proposed acquisition of rexam the amount of the gain or loss ultimately realized on these contracts and the resulting cash settlement is expected to be offset by the changes in the amount of cash consideration paid to acquire rexam 

  

we have entered into several regional committed and uncommitted accounts receivable factoring programs with various financial institutions for certain accounts receivables of the company the programs are accounted for as true sales of the receivables without recourse to ball and had combined limits of approximately 600 million at december 31 2015 a total of 4787 million and 1976 million were sold under these programs as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively 

  

annual cash dividends paid on common stock were 52 cents per share in 2015 2014 and 2013 total dividends paid were 718 million in 2015 727 million in 2014 and 752 million in 2013 we also paid dividends to noncontrolling interests of 179 million in 2015 122 million in 2014 and 129 million in 2013 

  

as of december 31 2015 approximately 219 million of our cash was held outside of the us there are no material legal or other economic restrictions regarding the repatriation of cash from any of the countries outside the us where we have cash the company believes its us operating cash flows the 22 billion available under the company’s longterm revolving credit facility the 452 million available under other usbased uncommitted shortterm credit facilities availability under usbased committed and uncommitted accounts receivable factoring programs and availability under the usbased accounts receivable securitization program will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of the us portion of the company’s ongoing operations scheduled principal and interest payments on us debt dividend payments capital expenditures and other us cash requirements if foreign funds are needed for our us cash requirements we will be required to accrue and pay us taxes net of applicable foreign tax credits to repatriate funds from foreign locations where the company has previously asserted indefinite reinvestment of funds outside the us however it continues to be the company’s intent to permanently reinvest these foreign amounts outside the us and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate the foreign amounts to fund our us cash requirements 

  

  

due to the us tax status of certain of ball’s subsidiaries in canada and the prc the company annually provides us taxes on foreign earnings in those subsidiaries net of any estimated foreign tax credits current taxes are also provided on certain other undistributed earnings that are currently taxed in the us net us taxes provided for brazil canada and prc earnings in 2015 2014 and 2013 were 17 million 118 million and 264 million respectively management’s intention is to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of ball’s remaining foreign investments and as a result no us income or federal withholding tax provision has been made the indefinite reinvestment assertion is supported by both longterm and shortterm forecasts and us financial requirements including but not limited to operating cash flows capital expenditures debt maturities and dividends the company has not provided deferred taxes on earnings in certain nonus subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in its international operations retained earnings in nonus subsidiaries were 20217 million as of december 31 2015 it is not practical to estimate the additional taxes that may become payable for the portion of these foreign earnings that have not already been taxed in the us however repatriation of these earnings could result in a material increase in the company’s income tax liabilities 

  

share repurchases 

  

the company’s share repurchases net of issuances totaled 995 million in 2015 3601 million in 2014 and 3988 million in 2013 the repurchases were completed using cash on hand and available borrowings and included accelerated share repurchase agreements and other purchases under our ongoing share repurchase program additional details about our share repurchase activities are provided in note 16 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

  

debt facilities and refinancing 

  

given our cash flow projections and unused credit facilities that are available until 2018 our liquidity is strong and is expected to meet our ongoing cash and debt service requirements total interestbearing debt was 51 billion at december 31 2015 compared to 32 billion at december 31 2014 

  

on february 19 2015 the company entered into a £33 billion unsecured bridge loan agreement pursuant to which lending institutions agreed subject to limited conditions to provide financing necessary to pay the cash portion of the consideration payable to rexam shareholders upon consummation of the proposed acquisition of rexam and related fees and expenses in december 2015 the company issued 1 billion of 4375 percent senior notes and €400 million of 35 percent senior notes all due in december 2020 and €700 million of 4375 percent senior notes due in december 2023 pursuant to the terms of the unsecured bridge loan agreement the company deposited the net proceeds from the issuance of such notes into an escrow account from which proceeds would be released subject to certain conditions to pay a portion of the cash consideration payable to rexam shareholders and related fees and expenses which reduced the commitments under the bridge loan agreement availability to £19 billion this reduction in the unsecured bridge loan resulted in the writeoff of 107 million of related deferred financing costs see note 13 for further details related to these transactions in the event that the rexam acquisition is not consummated on or prior to november 15 2016 these senior notes would be callable by the lender requiring the company to effect the redemption of all of the outstanding notes of each series at the applicable redemption price this would result in the use of restricted cash and other available funds to redeem these senior notes and pay any additional fees

  

on february 19 2015 the company entered into a new 3 billion revolving credit facility to replace the existing approximate 1 billion bank credit facility redeem the 2020 and 2021 senior notes and provide ongoing liquidity for the company in june 2015 ball issued 1 billion of 525 percent senior notes due in july 2025 ball used the net proceeds of the offering and other available cash to repay borrowings under its revolving credit facility and reduced the borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility from 3 billion to 225 billion in connection with this partial extinguishment the company recorded a charge of 50 million which is included in debt refinancing and other costs a component of total interest expense in the consolidated statements of earnings 

  

in addition on february 19 2015 the company announced the redemption of all of the outstanding 675 percent senior notes due in september 2020 and all of the 575 percent senior notes due in may 2021 each in the amount of 500 million the redemption of these bonds occurred in march 2015 and resulted in a pretax charge of 558 million composed of the redemption premiums and the writeoffs of related debt financing costs in debt refinancing and other costs 

  

on december 9 2013 we announced the redemption of our outstanding 7375 percent senior notes due in september 2019 in the amount of 3154 million the redemption occurred on january 10 2014 at a price per note of 10801 percent of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest the redemption of the bonds resulted in a pretax charge in the first quarter of 2014 of 331 million for the call premium and the writeoff of unamortized financing costs which is included in debt refinancing and other costs a component of total interest expense in the consolidated statements of earnings 

  

in june 2013 we amended the senior credit facilities and extended the term from december 2015 to june 2018 in connection with the amendment we recorded a charge of 04 million for the writeoff of unamortized financing costs which is included in debt refinancing and other costs a component of total interest expense in the consolidated statements of earnings 

  

  

in may 2013 we 1 issued 1 billion of 400 percent senior notes due in november 2023 2 tendered for the redemption of our 7125 percent senior notes originally due in september 2016 in the amount of 375 million at a redemption price per note of 105322 percent of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest and 3 repaid the 125 million term a loan which was a component of the senior credit facilities the redemption of the senior notes and the early repayment of the term a loan resulted in charges of 265 million for the tender and call premiums as well as the writeoff of unamortized financing costs and issuance discounts which is included in debt refinancing and other costs a component of total interest expense in the consolidated statements of earnings 

  

shortterm debt and current portion of longterm debt on the balance sheet includes any borrowings under the existing accounts receivable securitization agreement of which no amounts were outstanding at december 31 2015 this agreement which has been amended and extended from time to time is scheduled to mature in may 2017 and allows the company to borrow against a maximum amount of accounts receivable that varies between 90 million and 140 million depending on the seasonal accounts receivable balances in the company’s north american packaging businesses 

  

at december 31 2015 taking into account outstanding credit and excluding availability under the accounts receivable securitization program approximately 22 billion was available under the company’s longterm multicurrency committed revolving credit facilities in addition to these facilities the company had approximately 452 million of shortterm uncommitted credit facilities available at the end of 2015 of which 237 million was outstanding and due on demand the company has additional availability of 28 billion £19 billion through the unsecured committed bridge loan agreement of the amounts available under the credit facilities described above of approximately 55 billion we will be required to repay certain of rexam’s debt obligations and to settle rexam’s outstanding derivatives our best estimate based on the latest issued financials for rexam is that this will be 14 billion

  

while ongoing financial and economic conditions raise concerns about credit risk with counterparties to derivative transactions the company mitigates its exposure by allocating the risk among various counterparties and limiting exposure to any one party we also monitor the credit ratings of our suppliers customers lenders and counterparties on a regular basis 

  

we were in compliance with all loan agreements at december 31 2015 and all prior years presented and have met all debt payment obligations the us note agreements and bank credit agreement contain certain restrictions relating to dividends investments financial ratios guarantees and the incurrence of additional indebtedness additional details about our debt and receivables sales agreements are available in note 6 and note 13 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

  

other liquidity measures 

  

management performance measures 

  

management internally uses various measures to evaluate company performance such as return on average invested capital net operating earnings after tax over the relevant performance period divided by average invested capital over the same period economic value added eva® dollars net operating earnings after tax less a capital charge on average invested capital employed earnings before interest and taxes ebit earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda diluted earnings per share cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow generally defined by the company as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures we believe this information is also useful to investors as it provides insight into the earnings and cash flow criteria management uses to make strategic decisions these financial measures may be adjusted at times for items that affect comparability between periods such as business consolidation costs and gains or losses on acquisitions and dispositions 

  

nonfinancial measures in the packaging businesses include production efficiency and spoilage rates quality control figures environmental health and safety statistics production and sales volumes asset utilization rates and measures of sustainability additional measures used to evaluate financial performance in the aerospace and technologies segment include contract revenue realization award and incentive fees realized proposal win rates and backlog including awarded contracted and funded backlog 

  

  

the following financial measurements are on a nonus gaap basis and should be considered in connection with the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report nonus gaap measures should not be considered in isolation and should not be considered superior to or a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with us gaap a presentation of earnings in accordance with us gaap is available in item 8 of this annual report 

  

based on the above definitions our calculation of comparable ebit is summarized below 

  

   

our calculations of comparable ebitda the comparable ebit to interest coverage ratio and the net debt to comparable ebitda ratio are summarized below 

  

   

our calculation of comparable earnings is summarized below 

  

   

free cash flow 

  

management internally uses a free cash flow measure 1 to evaluate the company’s operating results 2 to evaluate strategic investments 3 to plan stock buyback and dividend levels and 4 to evaluate the company’s ability to incur and service debt free cash flow is not a defined term under us gaap and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures the company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures free cash flow is typically derived directly from the company’s consolidated statement of cash flows however it may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods 

  

  

based on the above definition our consolidated free cash flow is summarized as follows 

  

   

based on information currently available we estimate cash flows from operating activities including cash transaction costs for the proposed acquisition of rexam for 2016 to be in the range of 900 million capital expenditures to be approximately 400 million and free cash flow to be in the range of 500 million in 2016 we intend to utilize our operating cash flow to fund our stock repurchases dividend payments growth capital projects and to the extent available acquisitions that meet our various criteria of the total 2016 estimated capital expenditures approximately 150 million was contractually committed as of december 31 2015 

  

commitments 

  

cash payments required for longterm debt maturities rental payments under noncancellable operating leases purchase obligations and other commitments in effect at december 31 2015 are summarized in the following table 

  

   

a   amounts reported in local currencies have been translated at yearend 2015 exchange rates 

b   for variable rate facilities amounts are based on interest rates in effect at year end and do not contemplate the effects of any hedging instruments utilized by the company 

c   the company’s purchase obligations include capital expenditures and contracted amounts for aluminum steel and other direct materials also included are commitments for purchases of natural gas and electricity expenses related to aerospace and technologies contracts and other less significant items in cases where variable prices andor usage are involved management’s best estimates have been used depending on the circumstances early termination of the contracts may or may not result in penalties and therefore actual payments could vary significantly 

  

the table above does not include 505 million of uncertain tax positions the timing of which is unknown at this time 

  

contributions to the company’s defined benefit pension plans not including the unfunded german plans are expected to be 31 million in 2016 this estimate may change based on changes in the pension protection act and actual plan asset performance and available company cash flow among other factors benefit payments related to these plans are expected to be 941 million 974 million 1009 million 1045 million and 1086 million for the years ending december 31 2016 through 2020 respectively and a total of 584 million for the years 2021 through 2025 payments to participants in the unfunded german plans are expected to be between 16 million and 18 million in each of the years 2016 through 2020 and a total of 75 million for the years 2021 through 2025 

  

based on changes in return on asset and discount rate assumptions as well as revisions based on plan experience studies total pension expense in 2016 is anticipated to be approximately 6 million lower than in 2015 excluding curtailment expenses a reduction of the expected return on pension assets assumption by one quarter of a percentage point would result in an estimated 34 million increase in the 2016 pension expense while a quarter of a percentage point reduction in the discount rate applied to the pension liability would result in an estimated 48 million of additional pension expense in 2016 additional information regarding the company’s pension plans is provided in note 15 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

financial instruments and risk management 

  

the company employs established risk management policies and procedures which seek to reduce the company’s commercial risk exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices interest rates currency exchange rates and prices of the company’s common stock with regard to common share repurchases and the company’s deferred compensation stock plan however there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be successful although the instruments utilized involve varying degrees of credit market and interest risk the counterparties to the agreements are expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements the company monitors counterparty credit risk including lenders on a regular basis but ball cannot be certain that all risks will be discerned or that its risk management policies and procedures will always be effective additionally in the event of default under the company’s master derivative agreements the nondefaulting party has the option to set off any amounts owed with regard to open derivative positions further details are available in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

  

we have estimated our market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis market risk exposure has been defined as the changes in fair value of derivative instruments financial instruments and commodity positions to test the sensitivity of our market risk exposure we have estimated the changes in fair value of market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in market prices or rates the results of the sensitivity analyses are summarized below 

  

commodity price risk 

  

aluminum 

  

we manage commodity price risk in connection with market price fluctuations of aluminum ingot through two different methods first we enter into container sales contracts that include aluminum ingotbased pricing terms that generally reflect the same price fluctuations included in commercial purchase contracts for aluminum sheet the terms include fixed floating or passthrough aluminum ingot component pricing second we use derivative instruments such as option and forward contracts as economic and cash flow hedges of commodity price risk where there are material differences between sales and purchase contracted pricing and volume 

  

steel 

  

most sales contracts involving our steel products either include provisions permitting us to pass through some or all steel cost changes incurred or they incorporate annually negotiated steel prices we anticipate at this time that we will be able to pass through the majority of any steel price changes that may occur in 2016 

  

considering the effects of derivative instruments the company’s ability to pass through certain raw material costs through contractual provisions the market’s ability to accept price increases and the company’s commodity price exposures under its contract terms a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the company’s steel and aluminum prices would result in an estimated 25 million aftertax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period additionally the company has currency exposures on raw materials and the effect of a 10 percent adverse change is included in the total currency exposure discussed below actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates 

  

other 

  

the company is also exposed to fluctuations in prices for natural gas and electricity as well as the cost of diesel fuel as a component of freight cost a hypothetical 10 percent increase in our natural gas and electricity prices would result in an estimated 65 million aftertax reduction of net earnings over a oneyear period a hypothetical 10 percent increase in diesel fuel prices would result in an estimated 05 million aftertax reduction of net earnings over the same period actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates 

  

interest rate risk 

  

our objective in managing exposure to interest rate changes is to minimize the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to minimize our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we may use a variety of interest rate swaps collars and options to manage our mix of floating and fixedrate debt interest rate instruments held by the company at december 31 2015 included payfixed interest rate swaps which effectively convert variable rate obligations to fixedrate instruments 

  

  

based on our interest rate exposure at december 31 2015 excluding exposure associated with rexam interest rates as discussed below assumed floating rate debt levels throughout the next 12 months and the effects of derivative instruments a 100basis point increase in interest rates would result in an estimated 14 million aftertax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates and the timing of these changes 

  

interest rate risk—rexam acquisition 

  

the company entered into interest rate swaps to hedge against rising us and european interest rates to minimize its interest rate exposure associated with anticipated debt issuances in connection with the announced proposed acquisition of rexam at december 31 2015 the company had outstanding interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling approximately 200 million and €1750 million respectively in addition the company entered into interest rate option contracts to hedge negative euribor rates with an aggregate notional amount of €750 million subsequent to 2015 the company terminated interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of 923 million €850 million none of these contracts were designated as hedges and therefore changes in the fair value of these interest swap and option contracts are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings in debt refinancing and other costs a component of total interest expense the loss included in debt refinancing and other costs during 2015 associated with these contracts was 159 million the contracts outstanding at december 31 2015 expire within the next four years 

  

currency exchange rate risk 

  

our objective in managing exposure to currency fluctuations is to limit the exposure of cash flows and earnings from changes associated with currency exchange rate changes through the use of various derivative contracts in addition at times ball manages earnings translation volatility through the use of currency option strategies and the change in the fair value of those options is recorded in the company’s net earnings our currency translation risk results from the currencies in which we transact business the company faces currency exposures in our global operations as a result of various factors including intercompany currency denominated loans selling our products in various currencies purchasing raw materials and equipment in various currencies and tax exposures not denominated in the functional currency sales contracts are negotiated with customers to reflect cost changes and where there is not an exchange passthrough arrangement the company uses forward and option contracts to manage significant currency exposures 

  

considering the company’s derivative financial instruments outstanding at december 31 2015 excluding those related to the proposed rexam acquisition and the various currency exposures a hypothetical 10 percent reduction us dollar strengthening in currency exchange rates compared to the us dollar would result in an estimated 236 million aftertax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period this hypothetical adverse change in currency exchange rates would also reduce our forecasted average debt balance by 1196 million actual changes in market prices or rates may differ from hypothetical changes

  

currency exchange rate risk — rexam acquisition 

  

in connection with the announced proposed acquisition of rexam the company entered into collar and option contracts to partially mitigate its currency exchange rate risk from february 19 2015 through the expected closing date of the acquisition at december 31 2015 the company had outstanding collar and option contracts with notional amounts totaling approximately £18 billion 27 billion these contracts were not designated as hedges and therefore changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings in business consolidation and other activities see note 5 during 2015 the company recognized a loss of 410 million associated with these contracts the contracts outstanding at december 31 2015 expire within the next year a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening in the dollar versus the pound would reduce the fair value of the acquisition escrow account by approximately 100 million 

  

in connection with the december 2015 issuance of 1 billion of us dollar senior notes due 2020 the company executed crosscurrency swaps to convert this fixedrate us dollar debt issuance to fixedrate euro debt for the life of the notes to more effectively match the future cash flows of our business the crosscurrency swaps have a notional amount of 10 billion and expire within five years these contracts were not designated as hedges and therefore changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings as business consolidation costs and other activities during 2015 the company recognized a loss of 74 million associated with these contracts a hypothetical 10 percent reduction us dollar strengthening in currency exchange rates would reduce the fair value of the swaps by approximately 100 million a hypothetical 100 basis point change in the spread between usd and european interest rates would impact the fair value of the trade by approximately 50 million to the extent we ultimately have to pay to settle the derivative that is in a loss position the total us dollar equivalent of cash consideration for the purchase of rexam will be less and as a result will reduce the amount of goodwill recorded at the date of acquisition 

  

  

subsequent to the december 2015 issuances of 1 billion in senior notes due december 2020 and €11 billion of senior notes €400 million due 2020 and €700 million due 2023 the company converted the net euro proceeds from these issuances to british pounds using new and existing currency derivative instruments at an average exchange rate of approximately 137 the company elected to restrict the december 2015 senior note proceeds by depositing them in escrow accounts at december 31 2015 £792 million was in the british pound escrow account and 9875 million was in the us dollar escrow account changes in the us dollar and the british pound exchange rate will result in gains or losses in the british pound escrow account which will be recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings as business consolidation and other activities a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening in the dollar versus the pound would reduce the fair value of the escrow account by approximately 119 million subsequent to december 31 2015 the company converted the us dollars into british pounds the funds in the escrow accounts will be used to pay a portion of the cash component of the announced proposed acquisition price of rexam 

  

common stock price risk 

  

the company’s deferred compensation stock program is subject to variable plan accounting and accordingly is marked to fair value using the company’s closing stock price at the end of a reporting period the company entered into a total return swap to reduce the company’s earnings exposure to these fair value fluctuations that will be outstanding until march 2016 and has a notional value of 1 million shares based on current share levels in the program each 1 change in the company’s stock price has an impact net of derivatives utilized of 05 million on pretax earnings

our reporting segments 

  

ball corporation reports its financial performance in four reportable segments 1 metal beverage packaging americas and asia 2 metal beverage packaging europe 3 metal food and household products packaging and 4 aerospace and technologies ball also has investments in the us and vietnam that are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and accordingly those results are not included in segment sales or earnings financial information related to each of our segments is included in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report on form 10k annual report 

  

metal beverage packaging americas and asia segment 

  

metal beverage packaging americas and asia is ball’s largest segment accounting for 50 percent of consolidated net sales in 2014 metal beverage containers are primarily sold under multiyear supply contracts to fillers of carbonated soft drinks beer energy drinks and other beverages 

  

americas 

  

metal beverage containers and ends are produced at 15 manufacturing facilities in the us one in canada and four in brazil ends are produced within three of the us facilities including one facility that manufactures only ends and one facility in brazil additionally rocky mountain metal container llc a 50percent investment owned by ball and millercoors llc operates metal beverage container and end manufacturing facilities in golden colorado 

  

the north american metal beverage container manufacturing industry is relatively mature and industry volumes for certain types of containers have declined over the past several years where growth or contractions are projected in certain markets or for certain products ball undertakes selected capacity increases or decreases in its existing facilities to meet market demand a meaningful portion of the industrywide reduction in demand for standard 12ounce aluminum cans for the carbonated soft drink market is being offset with the growing demand for specialty container volumes from new and existing customers in february 2015 we announced the introduction of a nextgeneration aluminum bottleshaping technology in our conroe texas facility for a customer under a longterm arrangement that is expected to begin at the end of the first quarter of 2015 

  

according to publicly available information and company estimates the combined americas metal beverage container industry represents approximately 117 billion units five companies manufacture substantially all of the metal beverage containers in the us and canada and three companies manufacture substantially all such containers in brazil two of these producers and three other independent producers also manufacture metal beverage containers in mexico ball produced approximately 41 billion recyclable metal beverage containers in the americas in 2014 — about 35 percent of the aggregate production in these markets sales volumes of metal beverage containers in north america tend to be highest during the period from april through september while in brazil sales volumes tend to be highest from september through december all of the beverage containers produced by ball in the us canada and brazil are made of aluminum as are almost all beverage containers produced by our competitors in those countries in the americas six suppliers provide virtually all our aluminum can and end sheet requirements  

  

metal beverage containers are sold based on price quality service innovation and sustainability in a highly competitive market which is relatively capital intensive and is characterized by facilities that run more or less continuously in order to operate profitably in addition the metal beverage container competes aggressively with other packaging materials the glass bottle has maintained a meaningful position in the packaged beer industry and the polyethylene terephthalate pet container has grown in the carbonated soft drink and water industries 

  

we believe we have limited our exposure related to changes in the costs of aluminum ingot as a result of the inclusion of provisions in most metal beverage container sales contracts to pass through aluminum ingot price changes as well as through the use of derivative instruments 

  

asia 

  

the metal beverage container market in the people’s republic of china prc is approximately 31 billion containers of which ball’s operations represented an estimated 20 percent in 2014 our percentage of the industry makes us one of the largest manufacturers of metal beverage containers in the prc with six other manufacturers accounting for an estimated 69 percent of the production our operations include the manufacture of aluminum containers and ends in four facilities in the prc our aluminum can and end sheet requirements are provided by several suppliers 

  

  

during the first quarter of 2014 the company sold its plastic motor oil container and pail manufacturing business in the prc further details are available in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report additionally in may 2014 we announced the expansion of our asian operations with the construction of a new oneline beverage can manufacturing facility in myanmar which is expected to begin production in early 2016 

  

during july 2013 the company signed a compensation agreement with the prc government to close the company’s shenzhen manufacturing facility and relocate the production capacity by the end of 2013 further details are available in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

  

we believe we have limited our exposure related to changes in the costs of aluminum ingot as a result of the inclusion of provisions in most metal beverage container sales contracts to pass through aluminum ingot price changes as well as through the use of derivative instruments 

  

metal beverage packaging europe segment 

  

the european metal beverage container market excluding russia is approximately 60 billion containers and we are the second largest producer with an estimated 30 percent of european shipments the european market is highly regional in terms of sales growth rates and packaging mix 

  

the metal beverage packaging europe segment which accounted for 22 percent of ball’s consolidated net sales in 2014 supplies twopiece metal beverage containers and ends for producers of carbonated soft drinks beer energy drinks and other beverages the european operations consist of 12 facilities — 10 beverage container facilities and two beverage end facilities — of which four are located in germany three in the united kingdom two in france and one each in the netherlands poland and serbia in addition ball is currently renting space on the premises of a supplier in haslach germany in order to produce the ball resealable end bre the european beverage facilities produced approximately 18 billion metal beverage containers in 2014 with approximately 65 percent of those being produced from aluminum and 35 percent from steel seven of the beverage container facilities use aluminum and three use steel 

  

during august 2014 we announced the expansion of our beverage can manufacturing facility in oss the netherlands with the construction of a new line for aluminum beverage containers and a new warehouse the new line is expected to begin commercial production in the second quarter of 2015 strengthening our position as a logistical hub for our business in the benelux area and throughout europe the middle east and northern africa 

  

sales volumes of metal beverage containers in europe tend to be highest during the period from may through august with a smaller increase in demand leading up to the winter holiday season in the united kingdom much like other parts of the world the metal beverage container competes aggressively with other packaging materials used by the european beer and carbonated soft drink industries the glass bottle is heavily utilized in the packaged beer industry while the pet container is utilized in the carbonated soft drink beer juice and water industries 

  

european raw material supply contracts are generally for a period of one year although ball has negotiated some longer term agreements in europe three aluminum suppliers and two steel suppliers provide 97 percent of our requirements aluminum is traded primarily in us dollars while the functional currencies of the european operations are nonus dollars the company generally tries to minimize the resulting exchange rate risk using derivative and supply contracts in local currencies purchase and sales contracts generally include fixed price floating or passthrough pricing arrangements 

  

metal food and household products packaging segment 

  

the metal food and household products packaging segment accounted for 17 percent of consolidated net sales in 2014 ball produces twopiece and threepiece steel food containers and ends for packaging vegetables fruit soups meat seafood nutritional products pet food and other products the segment also manufactures and sells aerosol paint and general line and decorative specialty containers as well as extruded aluminum aerosol and beverage containers and aluminum slugs there are a total of 12 facilities in the us four in europe one in canada and one in mexico that produce these products in addition the company manufactures and sells steel aerosol containers in two facilities in argentina 

  

during august 2014 we announced the installation of a new extruded aluminum aerosol container line in our deforest wisconsin facility which is expected to begin production in the first half of 2015 additionally in october 2014 we announced the construction of a new extruded aluminum aerosol container manufacturing facility in india which is expected to begin production in the second half of 2015 in february 2015 we announced the introduction of a new steel aerosol container manufacturing technology in north america which is expected to start up in mid2015 

  

  

sales volumes of metal food containers in north america tend to be highest from may through october as a result of seasonal fruit vegetable and salmon packs we estimate our 2014 shipments of approximately 4 billion steel food containers to be approximately 16 percent of total us and canadian metal food container shipments we estimate our steel aerosol business accounts for approximately 36 percent of total annual us and canadian steel aerosol shipments in the us and canada we are the leading supplier of aluminum slugs used in the production of extruded aluminum aerosol containers and estimate our percentage of the total industry shipments to be approximately 87 percent ball’s european aluminum aerosol shipments represented approximately 21 percent of total european industry shipments in 2014 

  

in december 2012 the company acquired a leading producer of extruded aluminum aerosol packaging in mexico with a single manufacturing facility in san luis potosí the facility produces extruded aluminum aerosol containers for personal care and household products for customers in north central and south america and employs approximately 150 people the acquisition has provided a platform to grow the company’s existing north american extruded aluminum business providing a new end market for the company’s products including the company’s real tm technology that enables the use of recycled material and meaningful lightweighting in the manufacture of extruded aluminum packaging 

  

competitors in the metal food container product line include two national and a small number of regional suppliers and selfmanufacturers several producers in mexico also manufacture steel food containers competition in the us steel aerosol container market primarily includes three other national suppliers steel containers also compete with other packaging materials in the food and household products industry including glass aluminum plastic paper and pouches as a result profitability for this product line is dependent on price cost reduction service and quality in north america three steel suppliers provide approximately 70 percent of our tinplate steel we believe we have limited our exposure related to changes in the costs of steel tinplate and aluminum as a result of the inclusion of provisions in many sales contracts to pass through steel and aluminum cost changes and the existence of certain other steel container sales contracts that incorporate annually negotiated metal costs 

  

cost containment and maximizing asset utilization are crucial to maintaining profitability in the metal food and aerosol container manufacturing industries and ball is focused on doing so toward that end in february 2013 ball announced the closure of its metal food and aerosol container manufacturing facility in elgin illinois the facility which produced aerosol and specialty steel cans as well as flat steel sheet used by other ball food and household products packaging facilities ceased production in the fourth quarter of 2013 and its production capacity was consolidated into other ball facilities ball later announced in november 2013 the closure of its steel aerosol container manufacturing facility in danville illinois the facility ceased production in december 2014 and its production assets were deployed to other north american metal food and household products packaging facilities 

  

aerospace and technologies segment 

  

ball’s aerospace and technologies segment which accounted for 11 percent of consolidated net sales in 2014 includes national defense hardware antenna and video component technologies civil and operational space hardware and systems engineering services the segment develops spacecraft sensors and instruments radio frequency systems and other advanced technologies for the civil commercial and national security aerospace markets the majority of the aerospace and technologies business involves work under contracts generally from one to five years in duration as a prime contractor or subcontractor for the us department of defense dod the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and other us government agencies the company competes against both large and small prime contractors and subcontractors for these contracts contracts funded by the various agencies of the federal government represented 95 percent of segment sales in 2014 

  

intense competition and long operating cycles are key characteristics of both the company’s business and the aerospace and defense industry it is common in the aerospace and defense industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to another competitor become a subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting company it is not unusual to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or a customer of that same competitor on other contracts or vice versa 

  

geopolitical events and shifting executive and legislative branch priorities have resulted in an increase in opportunities over the past decade in areas matching our aerospace and technologies segment’s core capabilities in space hardware the businesses include hardware software and services sold primarily to us customers with emphasis on space science and exploration environmental and earth sciences and defense and intelligence applications major activities frequently involve the design manufacture and testing of satellites remote sensors and ground station control hardware and software as well as related services such as launch vehicle integration and satellite operations uncertainties in the federal government budgeting process could delay the funding or even result in cancellation of certain programs currently in our reported backlog 

  

  

other hardware activities include target identification warning and attitude control systems and components cryogenic systems for reactant storage and associated sensor cooling devices star trackers which are generalpurpose stellar attitude sensors and faststeering mirrors additionally the aerospace and technologies segment provides diversified technical services and products to government agencies prime contractors and commercial organizations for a broad range of information warfare electronic warfare avionics intelligence training and space systems needs 

  

backlog in the aerospace and technologies segment was 765 million and 938 million at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively and consisted of the aggregate contract value of firm orders excluding amounts previously recognized as revenue the 2014 backlog includes 517 million expected to be recognized in revenues during 2015 with the remainder expected to be recognized in revenues thereafter unfunded amounts included in backlog for certain firm government orders which are subject to annual funding were 410 million and 470 million at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively yearoveryear comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations due to the nature of varying delivery and milestone schedules on contracts funding of programs and the uncertainty of timing of future contract awards 

  

patents 

  

in the opinion of the company’s management none of our active patents or groups of patents is material to the successful operation of our business as a whole we manage our intellectual property portfolio to obtain the durations necessary to achieve our business objectives 

  

research and development 

  

research and development rd efforts in our packaging segments are primarily directed toward packaging innovation specifically the development of new features sizes shapes and types of containers as well as new uses for existing containers other additional rd efforts in these segments seek to improve manufacturing efficiencies and the overall sustainability of our products our packaging rd activities are primarily conducted in technical centers located in westminster colorado and in bonn germany

additional information regarding company rd activity is contained in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report as well as in item 2 “properties” 

  

sustainability and the environment 

  

sustainability is a key part of maximizing value at ball in our global operations we focus our sustainability efforts on employee safety and reducing energy water waste and air emissions in addition to those operational priorities we identified innovation packaging recycling talent management responsible sourcing and community engagement as priorities for our corporate sustainability efforts by continuously working toward reducing the environmental impacts of our products throughout their life cycle we also improve our financial results information about our corporate sustainability management goals and performance data are available at wwwballcomsustainability 

  

the biggest opportunity to further minimize the environmental impacts of metal packaging is to increase recycling rates aluminum and steel are infinitely recyclable materials and metal packaging is already the most recycled packaging in the world by using recycled material for the production of aluminum and steel up to 95 percent of the energy used for the production of virgin material can be saved in some of ball’s markets such as brazil china and several european countries recycling rates for beverage containers are at or above 90 percent the recycling rate in the us was 67 percent for aluminum beverage containers 2013 and 71 percent for steel containers 2012 recycling rates in europe averaged around 68 percent for aluminum beverage containers 2011 and 74 percent for steel containers 2012 

  

in several of ball’s markets we help establish and financially support recycling initiatives educating consumers about the benefits of recycling aluminum and steel containers and collaborating with industry partners to create effective collection and recycling systems contribute to increased recycling rates for more details about programs we support please visit wwwballcomrecycling

 item 1a risk factors 

  

any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

risks related to the proposed acquisition of rexam 

  

the announced proposed acquisition of rexam is subject to various closing conditions including governmental regulatory and shareholder approvals as well as other uncertainties and there can be no assurances as to whether and when it may be completed failure to consummate the proposed acquisition could negatively impact our stock price and our future business and financial results 

  

the consummation of the announced proposed acquisition of rexam is subject to certain customary conditions a number of the conditions are not within the company’s or rexam’s control and it is possible that such conditions may prevent delay or otherwise materially adversely affect the completion of the acquisition these conditions include among other things i approval of the issuance of shares of company common stock in connection with the offer to the shareholders of rexam by the holders of at least a majority of the shares of the company’s common stock present at a shareholder meeting ii approval of a courtsanctioned scheme of arrangement under part 26 of the uk companies act by the holders of at least a majority in number representing at least 75 percent of the issued share capital of rexam present at a shareholder meeting approval of related resolutions by at least a 75 percent majority of the issued capital of rexam present at a further shareholder meeting excluding shares held by the company if any and the sanction of the high court of england and wales iii the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 as amended as well as the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the antitrust laws of several other jurisdictions including the european union brazil and associated approvals and clearances and iv the absence of a material adverse effect on rexam and certain other actions related to rexam as described in the offer announcement the company cannot predict with certainty whether and when any of the required conditions will be satisfied or if another uncertainty may arise if the proposed acquisition does not receive or timely receive the required regulatory approvals and clearances or if another event occurs that delays or prevents the acquisition such delay or failure to complete the acquisition and the acquisition process may cause uncertainty or other negative consequences that may materially and adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations and to the extent that the current price of the company’s common stock reflects an assumption that the acquisition will be completed the price per share for the company’s common stock could be negatively impacted 

  

  

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the proposed acquisition or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected we may also encounter significant unexpected difficulties in integrating the two businesses 

  

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the proposed acquisition of rexam will depend to a large extent on our ability to integrate our business with rexam’s business combining two independent businesses is a complex costly and timeconsuming process as a result we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of the company and rexam the integration process may disrupt the combined business and if implemented ineffectively could preclude the realization of the full benefits of the acquisition currently expected our failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the two businesses to realize the anticipated benefits of the proposed acquisition could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in the activities of the company and could adversely affect the company’s results of operations in addition the overall integration of the businesses may result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses loss of customer relationships and diversion of certain management’s attention the difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include among others 

  

·   the diversion of certain management’s attention to integration matters 

·   difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings synergies business opportunities and growth prospects from combining our business with that of rexam 

·   difficulties in integrating operations business practices and systems 

·   difficulties in assimilating employees 

·   difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company 

·   challenges in retaining existing customers and suppliers 

·   challenges in obtaining new customers and suppliers 

·   potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses associated with the proposed acquisition and 

·   challenges in retaining and attracting key personnel 

  

many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy which could materially impact the business financial condition and results of operations of the company in addition even if the operations of the businesses of the company and rexam are integrated successfully we may not realize the full benefits of the transaction including the synergies cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect or the full benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the businesses of the company and rexam all of these factors could cause dilution to the earnings of the company decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the proposed acquisition or negatively impact the price of the company’s common stock as a result we cannot assure that the combination of the company and rexam’s businesses will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the proposed acquisition 

  

in order to close the proposed acquisition we will need to incur a significant level of debt that could have important consequences for our business and any investment in our securities 

  

on february 19 2015 the company entered into a £33 billion unsecured bridge loan agreement pursuant to which lending institutions have agreed subject to limited conditions to provide financing necessary to pay the cash portion of the consideration payable to rexam shareholders upon consummation of the proposed acquisition of rexam and related fees and expenses if the company borrows under the bridge loan agreement such indebtedness could have significant consequences for our business and any investment in our securities including 

  

·   increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic industry or competitive developments 

·   requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations capital expenditures and future business opportunities and returning cash to our shareholders 

·   restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make nonstrategic divestitures 

·   limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures product development debt service requirements acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes and 

·   limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged and who therefore may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting 

  

issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in connection with the proposed acquisition may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

  

a portion of the funding for the proposed acquisition of rexam is through the issuance of shares of our common stock  issuance of shares of our common stock in the proposed acquisition of rexam will dilute the interests of our thenexisting shareholders and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

  

  

if the proposed acquisition of rexam is not completed we may under certain circumstances be obligated to pay a break payment to rexam in the range of 1 percent to 7 percent of the total consideration contemplated to be paid in connection with the proposed acquisition 

  

if the proposed acquisition of rexam is not consummated by august 19 2016 unless extended by mutual agreement because certain regulatory approvals that are conditions to the acquisition have not been obtained or waived by us or the company has changed its recommendation that its shareholders vote in favor of the issuance of shares of its common stock in connection with the proposed acquisition of rexam citing as a reason the regulatory approvals the company would be required to pay rexam a break payment of 7 percent of the total consideration contemplated to be paid in connection with the proposed acquisition in addition if within six months of the offer announcement the company has otherwise changed its recommendation that its shareholders vote in favor of the issuance of shares of its common stock in connection with the proposed acquisition of rexam or has not held a shareholder meeting to vote on such issuance the company would be required to pay rexam a break payment of 3 percent of the total consideration contemplated to be paid in connection with the proposed acquisition further if within six months of the offer announcement the company has held a shareholder meeting for the purpose of holding a vote on the issuance of shares of its common stock in connection with the proposed acquisition of rexam but the shareholders have not approved such issuance the company would be required to pay rexam a break payment of 1 percent of the total consideration contemplated to be paid in connection with the proposed acquisition any break payment that the company may be required to pay may require the company to use available cash that would have otherwise been available for general corporate purposes and other matters for these and other reasons a failed acquisition could materially and adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations and the price per share of the company’s common stock 

  

in order to obtain regulatory clearance for the proposed acquisition of rexam we may be required to commit to significant divestitures which could negatively impact our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the proposed acquisition of rexam or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us 

  

in connection with obtaining the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 as amended as well as satisfying requirements under the antitrust laws of several other jurisdictions including the european union brazil and associated approvals and clearances we may be required to commit to significant divestitures the terms of the recommended offer as set forth in the offer announcement and the cooperation agreement require us to consummate the proposed acquisition of rexam even if certain regulators require significant divestitures that would not be accepted as sufficiently material to the company in the context of the proposed acquisition of rexam to permit the transaction to lapse if we are required to commit to undertake any such significant divestitures to complete the proposed acquisition of rexam we may not realize the anticipated benefit of the proposed acquisition including anticipated synergies and the company may otherwise suffer other negative consequences that may materially and adversely affect the company’s business financial condition and results of operations and to the extent that the current price of the company’s common stock reflects an assumption that the anticipated benefits of the proposed acquisition will be realized the price per share for the company’s common stock could be negatively impacted 

  

our business operating results and financial condition are subject to particular risks in certain regions of the world 

  

we may experience an operating loss in one or more regions of the world for one or more periods which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition moreover overcapacity which often leads to lower prices exists in a number of the regions in which we operate and may persist even if demand grows our ability to manage such operational fluctuations and to maintain adequate longterm strategies in the face of such developments will be critical to our continued growth and profitability 

  

there can be no assurance that the company’s business acquisitions will be successfully integrated into the acquiring company see note 4 and note 23 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report for details 

  

while we have what we believe to be well designed integration plans if we cannot successfully integrate the acquired operations with those of ball we may experience material negative consequences to our business financial condition or results of operations the integration of companies that have previously been operated separately involves a number of risks including but not limited to 

  

·   demands on management related to the increase in our size after the acquisition 

·   the diversion of management’s attention from the management of existing operations to the integration of the acquired operations 

·   difficulties in the assimilation and retention of employees 

·   difficulties in the integration of departments systems including financial systems technologies books and records and procedures as well as in maintaining uniform standards controls including internal accounting controls procedures and policies 

·   expenses related to any undisclosed or potential liabilities and 

·   retention of major customers and suppliers 

  

  

we may not be able to achieve potential synergies or maintain the levels of revenue earnings or operating efficiency that each business had achieved or might achieve separately the successful integration of the acquired operations will depend on our ability to manage those operations realize revenue opportunities and to some degree eliminate redundant and excess costs 

  

the loss of a key customer or a reduction in its requirements could have a significant negative impact on our sales 

  

we sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major beverage packaged food personal care and household product companies some of which operate in north america south america europe and asia 

  

although the majority of our customer contracts are longterm these contracts unless they are renewed expire in accordance with their respective terms and are terminable under certain circumstances such as our failure to meet quality volume or market pricing requirements because we depend on relatively few major customers our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss of any of these customers a reduction in the purchasing levels of these customers a strike or work stoppage by a significant number of these customers’ employees or an adverse change in the terms of the supply agreements with these customers 

  

the primary customers for our aerospace segment are us government agencies or their prime contractors our contracts with these customers are subject to several risks including funding cuts and delays technical uncertainties budget changes competitive activity and changes in scope 

  

we face competitive risks from many sources that may negatively impact our profitability 

  

competition within the packaging and aerospace industries is intense increases in productivity combined with existing or potential surplus capacity in the industry have maintained competitive pricing pressures the principal methods of competition in the general packaging industry are price innovation sustainability service and quality in the aerospace industry they are technical capability cost and schedule some of our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources and some may currently have significant excess capacity our current or potential competitors may offer products at a lower price or products that are deemed superior to ours the global economic environment has resulted in reductions in demand for our products in some instances which in turn could increase these competitive pressures 

  

we are subject to competition from alternative products which could result in lower profits and reduced cash flows 

  

our metal packaging products are subject to significant competition from substitute products particularly plastic carbonated soft drink bottles made from pet single serve beer bottles and other food and beverage containers made of glass cardboard or other materials competition from plastic carbonated soft drink bottles is particularly intense in the us europe and the prc certain of our aerospace products are also subject to competition from alternative products and solutions there can be no assurance that our products will successfully compete against alternative products which could result in a reduction in our profits or cash flow 

  

our packaging businesses have a narrow product range and our business would suffer if usage of our products decreased or if decreases occur in the demand for the beverages food and other goods filled in our products 

  

for the year ended december 31 2014 72 percent of our consolidated net sales were from the sale of metal beverage containers and we expect to derive a significant portion of our future revenues and cash flows from the sale of metal beverage containers our business would suffer if the use of metal beverage containers decreased accordingly broad acceptance by consumers of aluminum and steel containers for a wide variety of beverages is critical to our future success if demand for glass and pet bottles increases relative to metal containers the demand for aluminum and steel containers does not develop as expected or declines in consumption of carbonated soft drinks in north america continue our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

  

changes in laws and governmental regulations may adversely affect our business and operations 

  

we and our customers and suppliers are subject to various federal state provincial and local laws and regulations which are increasing in number and complexity each of our and their facilities is subject to federal state provincial and local licensing and regulation by health environmental workplace safety and other agencies in multiple jurisdictions requirements of worldwide governmental authorities with respect to manufacturing manufacturing facility locations within the jurisdiction product content and safety climate change workplace safety and health environmental expropriation of assets and other standards could adversely affect our ability to manufacture or sell our products and the ability of our customers and suppliers to manufacture and sell their products in addition we face risks arising from compliance with and enforcement of increasingly numerous and complex federal state provincial and local laws and regulations 

  

  

enacted regulatory developments regarding the reporting and use of “conflict minerals” mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries could affect the sourcing availability and price of minerals used in the manufacture of certain of our products as a result there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflictfree materials and we cannot give assurance that we will be able to obtain such products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices also because our supply chains are complex we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of all materials used in the products that we sell the compliance and reporting aspects of these regulations may result in incremental costs to the company 

  

while deposit systems and other containerrelated legislation have been adopted in some jurisdictions similar legislation has been defeated in public referenda and legislative bodies in many others we anticipate that continuing efforts will be made to consider and adopt such legislation in the future the packages we produce are widely used and perform well in us states canadian provinces and european countries that have deposit systems as well as in other countries worldwide 

  

significant environmental employmentrelated and other legislation and regulatory requirements exist and are also evolving the compliance costs associated with current and proposed laws and potential regulations could be substantial and any failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws or regulations could lead to litigation or governmental action all of which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

  

our business financial condition and results of operations are subject to risks resulting from broader geographic operations 

  

we derived approximately 41 percent of our consolidated net sales from outside of the us for the year ended december 31 2014 the sizeable scope of operations outside of the us may lead to more volatile financial results and make it more difficult for us to manage our business reasons for this include but are not limited to the following 

  

·   political and economic instability 

·   governments’ restrictive trade policies 

·   the imposition or rescission of duties taxes or government royalties 

·   exchange rate risks 

·   difficulties in enforcement of contractual obligations and intellectual property rights and 

·   the geographic language and cultural differences between personnel in different areas of the world 

  

any of these factors many of which are also present in the us could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

we are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations 

  

our reporting currency is the us dollar a portion of ball’s operations including assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses have been denominated in various transaction currencies other than the us dollar and we expect such operations will continue to be so denominated as a result the us dollar value of these operations has varied and will continue to vary with exchange rate fluctuations a decrease in the value of the various currencies compared to the us dollar could reduce our profits from these operations and the value of their net assets when reported in us dollars in our financial statements this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations as reported in us dollars in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to currencies in which the earnings are generated may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations 

  

we manage our exposure to currency fluctuations particularly our exposure to fluctuations in the euro to us dollar exchange rate to attempt to mitigate the effect of cash flow and earnings volatility associated with exchange rate changes we primarily use forward contracts and options to manage our currency exposures and as a result we experience gains and losses on these derivative positions offset in part by the impact of currency fluctuations on existing assets and liabilities our inability to properly manage our exposure to currency fluctuations could materially impact our results 

  

if we fail to retain key management and personnel we may be unable to implement our key objectives 

  

we believe that our future success depends in part on our experienced management team unforeseen losses of key members of our management team without appropriate succession andor compensation planning could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet our objectives 

  

  

decreases in our ability to apply new technology and knowhow may affect our competitiveness 

  

our success depends partially on our ability to improve production processes and services we must also introduce new products and services to meet changing customer needs if we are unable to implement better production processes or to develop new products through research and development or licensing of new technology we may not be able to remain competitive with other manufacturers as a result our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

adverse weather and climate changes may result in lower sales 

  

we manufacture packaging products primarily for beverages and foods unseasonably cool weather can reduce demand for certain beverages packaged in our containers in addition poor weather conditions or changes in climate that reduce crop yields of fruits and vegetables can adversely affect demand for our food containers climate change could have various effects on the demand for our products in different regions around the world 

  

we are vulnerable to fluctuations in the supply and price of raw materials 

  

we purchase aluminum steel and other raw materials and packaging supplies from several sources while all such materials are available from independent suppliers raw materials are subject to fluctuations in price and availability attributable to a number of factors including general economic conditions commodity price fluctuations particularly aluminum on the london metal exchange the demand by other industries for the same raw materials and the availability of complementary and substitute materials although we enter into commodities purchase agreements from time to time and sometimes use derivative instruments to seek to manage our risk we cannot ensure that our current suppliers of raw materials will be able to supply us with sufficient quantities at reasonable prices economic and financial factors could impact our suppliers thereby causing supply shortages increases in raw material costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in the americas europe and asia some contracts do not allow us to pass along increased raw material costs and we generally use derivative agreements to seek to manage this risk our hedging procedures may be insufficient and our results could be materially impacted if costs of materials increase due to the fixed price contracts and derivative activities while increasing raw material costs may not impact our nearterm profitability increased prices could decrease our sales volume over time 

  

prolonged work stoppages at facilities with union employees could jeopardize our financial position 

  

as of december 31 2014 approximately 35 percent of our north american packaging facility employees and approximately 73 percent of our european employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements these collective bargaining agreements have staggered expirations during the next several years although we consider our employee relations to be generally good a prolonged work stoppage or strike at any facility with union employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition we cannot ensure that upon the expiration of existing collective bargaining agreements new agreements will be reached without union action or that any such new agreements will be on terms satisfactory to us 

  

our aerospace and technologies segment is subject to certain risks specific to that business 

  

in our aerospace business us government contracts are subject to reduction or modification in the event of changes in requirements and the government may also terminate contracts at its convenience pursuant to standard termination provisions in such instances ball may be entitled to reimbursement for allowable costs and profits on authorized work that has been performed through the date of termination 

  

in addition budgetary constraints may result in further reductions to projected spending levels by the us government in particular government expenditures are subject to the potential for automatic reductions generally referred to as “sequestration” sequestration may occur in any given year resulting in significant additional reductions to spending by various us government defense and aerospace agencies on both existing and new contracts as well as the disruption of ongoing programs even if sequestration does not occur we expect that budgetary constraints and ongoing concerns regarding the us national debt will continue to place downward pressure on agency spending levels due to these and other factors overall spending on various programs could decline which could result in significant reductions to revenue cash flows net earnings and backlog primarily in our aerospace and technologies segment 

  

  

we use estimates in accounting for many of our programs in our aerospace business and changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results 

  

we account for sales and profits on some longterm contracts in our aerospace business in accordance with the percentageofcompletion method of accounting using the cumulative catchup method to account for updates in estimates the percentageofcompletion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project revenues and costs at completion and various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events including the quantity and timing of product deliveries future labor performance and rates and material and overhead costs these assumptions involve various levels of expected performance improvements under the cumulative catchup method the impact of updates in our estimates related to units shipped to date is recognized immediately 

  

because of the significance of the judgments and estimates described above it is likely that we could record materially different amounts if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances or estimates were to change accordingly updates in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates may materially affect our future financial performance 

  

our backlog includes both costtype and fixedprice contracts costtype contracts generally have lower profit margins than fixedprice contracts our earnings and margins may vary depending on the types of government contracts undertaken the nature of the work performed under those contracts the costs incurred in performing the work the achievement of other performance objectives and their impact on our ability to receive fees 

  

as a us government contractor we could be adversely affected by changes in regulations or any negative findings from a us government audit or investigation 

  

our aerospace business operates in a highly regulated environment and is routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its agencies such as the defense contract audit agency dcaa and defense contract management agency dcma these agencies review performance under our contracts our cost structure and our compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies business systems that are subject to review under the dod federal acquisition regulation supplement dfars are accounting purchasing estimating material management and accounting systems as well as property and earned value management any costs ultimately found to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if already reimbursed if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties sanctions or suspension or debarment from doing business with the us government whether or not illegal activities are alleged the us government also has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate if such actions were to result in suspension or debarment this could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

our business is subject to substantial environmental remediation and compliance costs 

  

our operations are subject to federal state provincial and local laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions relating to environmental hazards such as emissions to air discharges to water the handling and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes and the cleanup of hazardous substances we have been designated along with numerous other companies as a potentially responsible party for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites based on available information we do not believe that any costs incurred in connection with such sites will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations capital expenditures or competitive position there is increased focus on the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental issues worldwide 

  

our business faces the potential of increased regulation on some of the raw materials utilized in our packaging operations 

  

our operations are subject to federal state provincial and local laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions relating to some of the raw materials such as epoxybased coatings utilized in our container making process epoxybased coatings may contain bisphenola bpa scientific evidence evaluated by regulatory agencies in the united states canada europe japan australia and new zealand has consistently shown these coatings to be safe for food contact at current levels and these regulatory agencies have stated that human exposure to bpa from epoxybased container coatings is well below safe exposure limits set by government bodies worldwide a significant change in these regulatory agency statements adverse information concerning bpa or rulings made within certain federal state provincial and local jurisdictions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations ball recognizes that significant interest exists in non epoxybased coatings and we have been proactively working with coatings suppliers and our customers to evaluate alternatives to current coatings 

  

  

  

net earnings and net worth could be materially affected by an impairment of goodwill 

  

we have a significant amount of goodwill recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2014 we are required at least annually to test the recoverability of goodwill the recoverability test of goodwill is based on the current fair value of our identified reporting units fair value measurement requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors including revenue and market growth operating cash flows and discount rates if general market conditions deteriorate in portions of our business we could experience a significant decline in the fair value of reporting units this decline could lead to an impairment of all or a significant portion of the goodwill balance which could materially affect our us gaap net earnings and net worth 

  

if the investments in ball’s pension plans or in the multiemployer pension plans in which ball participates do not perform as expected we may have to contribute additional amounts to the plans which would otherwise be available to cover operating expenses and fund growth opportunities 

  

ball maintains defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of its north american and united kingdom employees which are funded based on certain actuarial assumptions the plans’ assets consist primarily of common stocks fixed income securities and in the us alternative investments market declines longevity increases or legislative changes such as the pension protection act in the us could result in a prospective decrease in our available cash flow and net earnings over time and the recognition of an increase in our pension obligations could result in a reduction to our shareholders’ equity additional risks exist related to the company’s participation in multiemployer pension plans assets contributed to a multiemployer pension plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers if a participating employer in a multiemployer pension plan stops contributing to the plan the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participants this could result in increases to our contributions to the plans as well as pension expense 

  

restricted access to capital markets could adversely affect our shortterm liquidity and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the notes issued pursuant to our bond indentures 

  

a reduction in global market liquidity could 

  

·   restrict our ability to fund working capital capital expenditures research and development expenditures and other business activities 

·   increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions including the credit risks stemming from the economic environment 

·   limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate 

·   restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities and 

·   limit along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt among other things our ability to borrow additional funds dispose of assets pay cash dividends or refinance debt maturities 

  

if market interest rates increase our variablerate debt will create higher debt service requirements which would adversely affect our cash flow while we sometimes enter into agreements limiting our exposure any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk 

  

the global credit financial and economic environment could have a negative impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

the overall credit financial and economic environment could have significant negative effects on our operations including 

  

·   the creditworthiness of customers suppliers and counterparties could deteriorate resulting in a financial loss or a disruption in our supply of raw materials 

·   volatile market performance could affect the fair value of our pension assets potentially requiring us to make significant additional contributions to our defined benefit plans to maintain prescribed funding levels 

·   a significant weakening of our financial position or operating results could result in noncompliance with our debt covenants and 

·   reduced cash flow from our operations could adversely affect our ability to execute our longterm strategy to increase liquidity reduce debt repurchase our stock and invest in our businesses 

  

  

changes in us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap and securities and exchange commission sec rules and regulations could materially impact our reported results 

  

us gaap and sec accounting and reporting changes are common and have become more frequent and significant over the past several years furthermore the us and international accounting standard setters are in the process of jointly converging several key accounting standards these changes could have significant effects on our reported results when compared to prior periods and other companies and may even require us to retrospectively adjust prior periods additionally material changes to the presentation of transactions in the consolidated financial statements could impact key ratios that analysts and credit rating agencies use to rate ball and ultimately our ability to access the credit markets in an efficient manner 

  

increased information technology it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems networks products solutions and services 

  

increased global it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including employee training comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems networks products solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats depending on their nature and scope such threats could potentially lead to the compromise of confidential information improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which in turn could adversely affect our reputation competitiveness and results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

management’s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k which include additional information about our accounting policies practices and the transactions underlying our financial results the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes including various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits taxes environmental and other matters arising during the normal course of business we apply our best judgment our knowledge of existing facts and circumstances and actions that we may undertake in the future in determining the estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances such as current economic conditions and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change as future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision actual results may differ from these estimates ball corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as “ball corporation” “ball” “the company” or “we” or “our” in the following discussion and analysis 

  

overview 

  

business overview and industry trends 

  

ball corporation is one of the world’s leading suppliers of metal packaging to the beverage food personal care and household products industries our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses are manufactured in facilities around the world and are competitive with other substrates such as plastics and glass in the rigid packaging industry sales and earnings can be increased by reducing costs increasing prices developing new products expanding volumes and making strategic acquisitions we also provide aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers 

  

we sell our packaging products mainly to large multinational beverage food personal care and household products companies with which we have developed longterm customer relationships this is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of longterm supply contracts while we have a diversified customer base we sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major companies in north america europe asia and south america as do our equity joint ventures in the us and vietnam the overall metal container industry is growing globally and is expected to continue to grow in the medium to long term despite the north american industry seeing a continued decline in standardsized aluminum beverage packaging for the carbonated soft drink market the primary customers for the products and services provided by our aerospace and technologies segment are us government agencies or their prime contractors 

  

we purchase our raw materials from relatively few suppliers we also have exposure to inflation in particular the rising costs of raw materials as well as other direct cost inputs we mitigate our exposure to the changes in the costs of metal through the inclusion of provisions in contracts covering the majority of our volumes to pass through metal price changes as well as through the use of derivative instruments the passthrough provisions generally result in proportional increases or decreases in sales and costs with a greatly reduced impact if any on net earnings because of our customer and supplier concentration our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss insolvency or bankruptcy of a major customer or supplier or a change in a supply agreement with a major customer or supplier although our contract provisions generally mitigate the risk of customer loss and our longterm relationships represent a known stable customer base 

  

we recognize sales under longterm contracts in the aerospace and technologies segment using percentageofcompletion under the costtocost method of accounting throughout the period of contract performance we regularly reevaluate and if necessary revise our estimates of aerospace and technologies total contract revenue total contract cost and progress toward completion because of contract payment schedules limitations on funding and other contract terms our sales and accounts receivable for this segment include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed 

  

  

corporate strategy 

  

our drive for 10 vision encompasses five strategic levers that are key to growing our business and achieving longterm success since launching drive for 10 in 2011 we made progress on each of the levers as follows 

  

·   maximizing value in our existing businesses by rationalizing standard beverage container and end capacity in north america and expanding specialty container production to meet current demand leveraging plant floor systems in our metal beverage facilities to improve efficiencies and reduce costs consolidating andor closing multiple metal beverage and metal food and aerosol packaging facilities relocating our european headquarters to zurich switzerland to gain business customer and supplier efficiencies and implementing costout and valuein initiatives across all of our businesses 

  

·   expanding further into new products and capabilities by expanding into extruded aluminum aerosol manufacturing with our mexican acquisition in december 2012 and the installation of a new extruded aluminum aerosol line in our deforest wisconsin facility during 2014 and successfully commercializing extruded aluminum aerosol packaging that utilizes a significant amount of recycled material 

  

·   aligning ourselves with the right customers and markets by investing capital to meet doubledigit volume growth for specialty beverage containers throughout our global network which now represent over 27 percent of our global beverage packaging mix and the introduction of next generation aluminum bottleshaping technology in north america for a customer under a long term arrangement that is scheduled to start up at the end of the first quarter 2015 

  

·   broadening our geographic reach with new investments in a metal beverage manufacturing facility in myanmar as well as an extruded aluminum aerosol manufacturing facility in india and the award of a south korean environmental instrument in our aerospace business and 

  

·   leveraging our technological expertise in packaging innovation including the introduction of nextgeneration aluminum bottleshaping technologies the introduction of a new steel aerosol manufacturing technology starting up in mid2015 and a joint effort between our aerospace business nasa and the japan aerospace exploration agency to collect science data on the earth’s rain and snowfall via the global precipitation measurement gpm microwave imager as well as other technologies to maintain our competitive advantage today and in the future 

  

these ongoing business developments help us stay close to our customers while expanding andor sustaining our industry positions with major beverage food personal care household products and aerospace customers 

  

results of operations 

  

consolidated sales and earnings 

  

   

the increase in net sales in 2014 compared to 2013 was due primarily to higher metal beverage container sales volumes and higher aerospace program revenues partially offset by lower north american food and household product volumes net earnings were favorably impacted by higher metal beverage container sales volumes lower cost of sales as a percentage of net sales lower depreciation expense lower interest expense and a lower tax rate in 2014 partially offset by lower north american food and household product volumes unfavorable tinplate service center manufacturing performance in the us higher debt refinancing costs and higher selling general and administrative costs in 2014 

  

the decrease in net sales in 2013 compared to 2012 was driven largely by lower demand for standard 12ounce aluminum beverage containers in the us partially offset by specialty can growth in the americas and higher sales volumes in europe brazil and the prc earnings were flat compared to 2012 with lower standard 12ounce volumes in the us and higher selling general and administrative expenses being offset by higher specialty can volumes in the americas and improved cost management in our global packaging operations 

  

  

cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization

selling general and administrative 

  

selling general and administrative sga expenses were 4665 million in 2014 compared to 4186 million in 2013 and 3855 million in 2012 these amounts represented 54 percent 49 percent and 44 percent of consolidated net sales for those three years respectively the increase in sga in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to higher incentive compensation and employee benefit costs and other individually insignificant higher costs the higher expenses in 2013 compared to 2012 were largely related to the reassessment of certain expenses in europe from cost of sales to sga in light of the relocation of the european headquarters 

  

interest expense 

  

consolidated interest expense was 1930 million in 2014 compared to 2118 million in 2013 and 1949 million in 2012 excluding debt refinancing costs interest expense in 2014 was lower than in 2013 due primarily to lower average debt levels and lower average borrowing rates excluding debt refinancing costs interest expense in 2013 was higher than in 2012 due to higher average debt levels and the timing difference of the issuance of 1 billion senior notes due in 2023 versus the tender and call of the 2016 senior notes partially offset by lower average borrowing rates interest expense excluding the effect of debt refinancing costs as a percentage of average monthly borrowings was 48 percent in 2014 51 percent in 2013 and 55 percent in 2012

the effective income tax rate for earnings from continuing operations was 232 percent in 2014 compared to 256 percent in 2013 and 289 percent in 2012 the lower tax rate in 2014 was primarily the result of a higher foreign tax rate differential lower us taxes on foreign earnings and the 2014 releases of uncertain tax positions which exceeded those occurring in 2013 the lower tax rate in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily the result of the retroactive extension of the us research and development credit a lower state effective tax rate and a higher foreign tax rate differential partially offset by higher us taxes on foreign earnings and the 2012 releases of uncertain tax positions which exceeded those occurring in 2013

other liquidity measures 

  

management performance measures 

  

management internally uses various measures to evaluate company performance such as return on average invested capital net operating earnings after tax over the relevant performance period divided by average invested capital over the same period economic value added eva® dollars net operating earnings after tax less a capital charge on average invested capital employed earnings before interest and taxes ebit earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda diluted earnings per share cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow generally defined by the company as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures we believe this information is also useful to investors as it provides insight into the earnings and cash flow criteria management uses to make strategic decisions these financial measures may be adjusted at times for items that affect comparability between periods such as business consolidation costs and gains or losses on acquisitions and dispositions 

  

nonfinancial measures in the packaging businesses include production efficiency and spoilage rates quality control figures environmental health and safety statistics production and sales volumes asset utilization rates and measures of sustainability additional measures used to evaluate financial performance in the aerospace and technologies segment include contract revenue realization award and incentive fees realized proposal win rates and backlog including awarded contracted and funded backlog 

  

the following financial measurements are on a nonus gaap basis and should be considered in connection with the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report nonus gaap measures should not be considered in isolation and should not be considered superior to or a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with us gaap a presentation of earnings in accordance with us gaap is available in item 8 of this annual report 

  

based on the above definitions our calculation of comparable ebit is summarized below 

  

   

our calculations of comparable ebitda the comparable ebit to interest coverage ratio and the net debt to comparable ebitda ratio are summarized below 

  

   

  

our calculation of comparable earnings is summarized below 

  

   

a   2012 amounts have been revised for the prior period correction of deferred taxes further details are included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

  

free cash flow 

  

management internally uses a free cash flow measure 1 to evaluate the company’s operating results 2 to evaluate strategic investments 3 to plan stock buyback and dividend levels and 4 to evaluate the company’s ability to incur and service debt free cash flow is not a defined term under us gaap and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures the company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures free cash flow is typically derived directly from the company’s consolidated statement of cash flows however it may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods 

  

based on the above definition our consolidated free cash flow is summarized as follows 

  

   

based on information currently available we estimate cash flows from operating activities for 2015 to be in the range of 1 billion capital expenditures to be approximately 400 million and free cash flow to be in the range of 600 million in 2015 we intend to utilize our operating cash flow to fund our stock repurchases dividend payments growth capital projects and to the extent available acquisitions that meet our various criteria of the total 2015 estimated capital expenditures approximately 170 million was contractually committed as of december 31 2014 

  

  

commitments 

  

cash payments required for longterm debt maturities rental payments under noncancellable operating leases purchase obligations and other commitments in effect at december 31 2014 are summarized in the following table 

  

   

a   amounts reported in local currencies have been translated at yearend 2014 exchange rates 

b   for variable rate facilities amounts are based on interest rates in effect at year end and do not contemplate the effects of any hedging instruments utilized by the company 

c   the company’s purchase obligations include contracted amounts for aluminum steel and other direct materials also included are commitments for purchases of natural gas and electricity expenses related to aerospace and technologies contracts and other less significant items in cases where variable prices andor usage are involved management’s best estimates have been used depending on the circumstances early termination of the contracts may or may not result in penalties and therefore actual payments could vary significantly 

  

the table above does not include 655 million of uncertain tax positions the timing of which is unknown at this time 

  

contributions to the company’s defined benefit pension plans not including the unfunded german plans are expected to be insignificant in 2015 this estimate may change based on changes in the pension protection act and actual plan asset performance and available company cash flow among other factors benefit payments related to these plans are expected to be 916 million 949 million 988 million 1021 million and 1060 million for the years ending december 31 2015 through 2019 respectively and a total of 5728 million for the years 2020 through 2024 payments to participants in the unfunded german plans are expected to be between 18 million and 20 million in each of the years 2015 through 2019 and a total of 87 million for the years 2020 through 2024 

  

based on changes in return on asset and discount rate assumptions as well as revisions based on plan experience studies total pension expense in 2015 is anticipated to be approximately 7 million higher than in 2014 excluding curtailment expenses a reduction of the expected return on pension assets assumption by one quarter of a percentage point would result in an estimated 36 million increase in the 2015 pension expense while a quarter of a percentage point reduction in the discount rate applied to the pension liability would result in an estimated 54 million of additional pension expense in 2015 additional information regarding the company’s pension plans is provided in note 14 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

  

due to the us tax status of certain of ball’s subsidiaries in canada and the prc the company annually provides us taxes on foreign earnings in those subsidiaries net of any estimated foreign tax credits the company also provides deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings in its brazil investment related to its 10 percent indirectly held investment current taxes are also provided on certain other undistributed earnings that are currently taxed in the us net us taxes provided for brazil canada and prc earnings in 2014 2013 and 2012 were 118 million 264 million and 145 million respectively management’s intention is to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of ball’s remaining foreign investments and as a result no us income or federal withholding tax provision has been made the indefinite reinvestment assertion is supported by both longterm and shortterm forecasts and us financial requirements including but not limited to operating cash flows capital expenditures debt maturities and dividends the company has not provided deferred taxes on earnings in certain nonus subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in its international operations retained earnings in nonus subsidiaries was 17994 million as of december 31 2014 it is not practical to estimate the additional taxes that may become payable upon the eventual remittance of these foreign earnings to the us however repatriation of these earnings could result in a material increase in the company’s effective tax rate or if the intention to indefinitely reinvest is discontinued

the company is routinely subject to litigation incident to operating its businesses and has been designated by various federal and state environmental agencies as a potentially responsible party along with numerous other companies for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites the company believes that the matters identified will not have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity results of operations or financial condition of the company details of the company’s legal proceedings are included in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

financial instruments and risk management 

  

the company employs established risk management policies and procedures which seek to reduce the company’s commercial risk exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices interest rates currency exchange rates and prices of the company’s common stock with regard to common share repurchases and the company’s deferred compensation stock plan however there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be successful although the instruments utilized involve varying degrees of credit market and interest risk the counterparties to the agreements are expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements the company monitors counterparty credit risk including lenders on a regular basis but ball cannot be certain that all risks will be discerned or that its risk management policies and procedures will always be effective additionally in the event of default under the company’s master derivative agreements the nondefaulting party has the option to setoff any amounts owed with regard to open derivative positions further details are available in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

  

we have estimated our market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis market risk exposure has been defined as the changes in fair value of derivative instruments financial instruments and commodity positions to test the sensitivity of our market risk exposure we have estimated the changes in fair value of market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in market prices or rates the results of the sensitivity analyses are summarized below 

  

commodity price risk 

  

aluminum 

  

we manage commodity price risk in connection with market price fluctuations of aluminum ingot through two different methods first we enter into container sales contracts that include aluminum ingotbased pricing terms that generally reflect the same price fluctuations included in commercial purchase contracts for aluminum sheet the terms include fixed floating or passthrough aluminum ingot component pricing second we use derivative instruments such as option and forward contracts as economic and cash flow hedges of commodity price risk where there are material differences between sales and purchase contracted pricing and volume 

  

steel 

  

most sales contracts involving our steel products either include provisions permitting us to pass through some or all steel cost changes incurred or they incorporate annually negotiated steel prices we anticipate at this time that we will be able to pass through the majority of any steel price changes that may occur in 2015 

  

considering the effects of derivative instruments the company’s ability to pass through certain raw material costs through contractual provisions the market’s ability to accept price increases and the company’s commodity price exposures under its contract terms a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the company’s steel and aluminum prices could result in an estimated 44 million aftertax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period additionally the company has currency exposures on raw materials and the effect of a 10 percent adverse change is included in the total currency exposure discussed below actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates 

  

other 

  

the company is also exposed to fluctuations in prices for natural gas and electricity as well as the cost of diesel fuel as a component of freight cost a hypothetical 10 percent increase in our natural gas and electricity prices could result in an estimated 71 million aftertax reduction of net earnings over a oneyear period a hypothetical 10 percent increase in diesel fuel prices could result in an estimated 04 million aftertax reduction of net earnings over the same period actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates 

  

  

interest rate risk 

  

our objective in managing exposure to interest rate changes is to minimize the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we may use a variety of interest rate swaps collars and options to manage our mix of floating and fixedrate debt interest rate instruments held by the company at december 31 2014 included payfixed interest rate swaps which effectively convert variable rate obligations to fixedrate instruments 

  

based on our interest rate exposure at december 31 2014 assumed floating rate debt levels throughout the next 12 months and the effects of derivative instruments a 100basis point increase in interest rates could result in an estimated 16 million aftertax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates and the timing of these changes 

  

currency exchange rate risk 

  

our objective in managing exposure to currency fluctuations is to limit the exposure of cash flows and earnings from changes associated with currency exchange rate changes through the use of various derivative contracts in addition at times ball manages earnings translation volatility through the use of currency option strategies and the change in the fair value of those options is recorded in the company’s net earnings our currency translation risk results from the currencies in which we transact business the company faces currency exposures in our global operations as a result of various factors including intercompany currency denominated loans selling our products in various currencies purchasing raw materials and equipment in various currencies and tax exposures not denominated in the functional currency sales contracts are negotiated with customers to reflect cost changes and where there is not an exchange passthrough arrangement the company uses forward and option contracts to manage significant currency exposures 

  

considering the company’s derivative financial instruments outstanding at december 31 2014 and the various currency exposures the company is facing a hypothetical 10 percent reduction us dollar strengthening in currency exchange rates compared to the us dollar could result in an estimated 396 million aftertax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period this hypothetical adverse change in currency exchange rates would also reduce our forecasted average debt balance by 94 million actual changes in market prices or rates may differ from hypothetical changes 

  

common stock price risk 

  

the company’s deferred compensation stock program is subject to variable plan accounting and accordingly is marked to fair value using the company’s closing stock price at the end of a reporting period based on current share levels in the program each 1 change in the company’s stock price has an impact of 13 million on pretax earnings the company entered into a total return swap to reduce the company’s earnings exposure to these fair value fluctuations that will be outstanding until march 2015 and has a notional value of 1 million shares

our reporting segments 

  

ball corporation reports its financial performance in four reportable segments 1 metal beverage packaging americas and asia 2 metal beverage packaging europe 3 metal food and household products packaging and 4 aerospace and technologies on january 1 2013 the company implemented changes to its management and internal reporting structure as a result the european extruded aluminum business which was previously included in the metal beverage packaging europe segment is now included in the metal food and household products packaging segment ball also has investments in the us and vietnam which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and accordingly those results are not included in segment sales or earnings financial information related to each of our segments is included in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report on form 10k annual report 

  

metal beverage packaging americas and asia segment 

  

metal beverage packaging americas and asia is ball’s largest segment accounting for 49 percent of consolidated net sales in 2013 metal beverage containers are primarily sold under multiyear supply contracts to fillers of carbonated soft drinks beer energy drinks and other beverages 

  

americas 

  

metal beverage containers and ends are produced at 15 manufacturing facilities in the us one in canada and four in brazil ends are produced within three of the us facilities including one facility that manufactures only ends and one facility in brazil additionally rocky mountain metal container llc a 50percent investment owned by ball and millercoors llc operates metal beverage container and end manufacturing facilities in golden colorado 

  

the north american metal beverage container manufacturing industry is relatively mature and industry volumes for certain types of containers have declined over the past several years where growth or contractions are projected in certain markets or for certain products ball undertakes selected capacity increases or decreases in its existing facilities to meet market demand which may include both permanent and temporary capacity realignment a meaningful portion of the industrywide reduction in demand for standard 12ounce aluminum cans for the carbonated soft drink market is being offset with the growing demand for specialty container volumes from new and existing customers 

  

according to publicly available information and company estimates the combined americas metal beverage container industry represents approximately 119 billion units five companies manufacture substantially all of the metal beverage containers in the us and canada and three companies manufacture substantially all such containers in brazil two of these producers and three other independent producers also manufacture metal beverage containers in mexico ball produced approximately 40 billion recyclable metal beverage containers in the americas in 2013 — about 35 percent of the aggregate production sales volumes of metal beverage containers in north america tend to be highest during the period from april through september while in brazil sales volumes tend to be highest from september through december all of the beverage containers produced by ball in the us canada and brazil are made of aluminum as are almost all beverage containers produced by our competitors in those countries in the metal beverage packaging americas segment six suppliers provide virtually all our aluminum can and end sheet requirements  

  

metal beverage containers are sold based on price quality service innovation and sustainability in a highly competitive market which is relatively capital intensive and is characterized by facilities that run more or less continuously in order to operate profitably in addition the metal beverage container competes aggressively with other packaging materials the glass bottle has maintained a meaningful position in the packaged beer industry and the polyethylene terephthalate pet container has grown in the carbonated soft drink and water industries 

  

we believe we have limited our exposure related to changes in the costs of aluminum ingot as a result of the inclusion of provisions in most metal beverage container sales contracts to pass through aluminum ingot price changes as well as through the use of derivative instruments 

  

asia 

  

the metal beverage container market in the prc is approximately 25 billion containers of which ball’s operations represented an estimated 22 percent in 2013 our percentage of the industry makes us one of the largest manufacturers of metal beverage containers in the prc with five other manufacturers accounting for an estimated 67 percent of the production our operations include the manufacture of aluminum containers and ends in four facilities in the prc we also manufacture and sell highdensity plastic containers in two prc facilities primarily servicing the motor oil industry 

  

  

during july 2013 the company signed a compensation agreement with the prc government to close the shenzhen manufacturing facility and relocate the production capacity by the end of 2013 further details are available in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

  

we believe we have limited our exposure related to changes in the costs of aluminum ingot as a result of the inclusion of provisions in most metal beverage container sales contracts to pass through aluminum ingot price changes as well as through the use of derivative instruments 

  

metal beverage packaging europe segment 

  

the european metal beverage container market excluding russia is approximately 59 billion containers and we are the second largest producer with an estimated 30 percent of european shipments the european market is highly regional in terms of sales growth rates and packaging mix 

  

the metal beverage packaging europe segment which accounted for 22 percent of ball’s consolidated net sales in 2013 supplies twopiece metal beverage containers and ends for producers of carbonated soft drinks beer energy drinks and other beverages the european operations consist of 12 facilities — 10 beverage container facilities and two beverage end facilities — of which four are located in germany three in the united kingdom two in france and one each in the netherlands poland and serbia in addition ball is currently renting space on the premises of a supplier in haslach germany in order to produce the ball resealable end bre the european beverage facilities produced approximately 18 billion metal beverage containers in 2013 with approximately 63 percent of those being produced from aluminum and 37 percent from steel seven of the beverage container facilities use aluminum and three use steel 

  

sales volumes of metal beverage containers in europe tend to be highest during the period from may through august with a smaller increase in demand leading up to the winter holiday season in the united kingdom much like other parts of the world the metal beverage container competes aggressively with other packaging materials used by the european beer and carbonated soft drink industries the glass bottle is heavily utilized in the packaged beer industry while the pet container is utilized in the carbonated soft drink beer juice and water industries 

  

european raw material supply contracts are generally for a period of one year although ball has negotiated some longer term agreements in europe three aluminum suppliers and two steel suppliers provide 93 percent of our requirements aluminum is traded primarily in us dollars while the functional currencies of the european operations are nonus dollars the company generally tries to minimize the resulting exchange rate risk using derivative and supply contracts in local currencies in addition purchase and sales contracts generally include fixed price floating and passthrough pricing arrangements 

  

metal food and household products packaging segment 

  

on january 1 2013 the company implemented changes to its management and internal reporting structure as a result the european extruded aluminum business which was previously included in the metal beverage packaging europe segment is now included in the metal food and household products packaging segment 

  

the metal food and household products packaging segment accounted for 18 percent of consolidated net sales in 2013 ball produces twopiece and threepiece steel food containers and ends for packaging vegetables fruit soups meat seafood nutritional products pet food and other products the segment also manufactures and sells aerosol paint and general line and decorative specialty containers as well as extruded aluminum aerosol and beverage containers and aluminum slugs there are a total of 13 facilities in the us four in europe one in canada and one in mexico that produce these products in addition the company manufactures and sells steel aerosol containers in two facilities in argentina 

  

sales volumes of metal food containers in north america tend to be highest from may through october as a result of seasonal fruit vegetable and salmon packs we estimate our 2013 shipments of approximately 5 billion steel food containers to be approximately 17 percent of total us and canadian metal food container shipments we estimate our aerosol business accounts for approximately 38 percent of total annual us and canadian steel aerosol shipments in the us and canada we are the leading supplier of aluminum slugs used in the production of extruded aluminum aerosol containers and estimate our percentage of the total industry shipments to be approximately 89 percent ball’s european aluminum aerosol shipments represented approximately 21 percent of total european industry shipments in 2013 

  

  

in december 2012 the company acquired a leading producer of extruded aluminum aerosol packaging in mexico with a single manufacturing facility in san luis potosí the facility produces extruded aluminum aerosol containers for personal care and household products for customers in north central and south america and employs approximately 150 people the acquisition has provided a platform to grow the company’s existing north american extruded aluminum business providing a new end market for the company’s products including the company’s real tm technology that enables the use of recycled material and meaningful lightweighting in the manufacture of extruded aluminum packaging 

  

competitors in the metal food container product line include two national and a small number of regional suppliers and selfmanufacturers several producers in mexico also manufacture steel food containers competition in the us steel aerosol container market primarily includes three other national suppliers steel containers also compete with other packaging materials in the food and household products industry including glass aluminum plastic paper and pouches as a result profitability for this product line is dependent on price cost reduction service and quality in north america three steel suppliers provide approximately 65 percent of our tinplate steel we believe we have limited our exposure related to changes in the costs of steel tinplate and aluminum as a result of the inclusion of provisions in many sales contracts to pass through steel and aluminum cost changes and the existence of certain other steel container sales contracts that incorporate annually negotiated metal costs 

  

cost containment and maximizing asset utilization are crucial to maintaining profitability in the metal food and aerosol container manufacturing industries and ball is focused on doing so toward that end in february 2013 ball announced the closure of its metal food and aerosol container manufacturing facility in elgin illinois the facility which produced aerosol and specialty steel cans as well as flat steel sheet used by other ball food and household products packaging facilities ceased production in the fourth quarter of 2013 and its production capacity was consolidated into other ball facilities ball later announced in november 2013 that it will close its steel aerosol container manufacturing facility in danville illinois in the second half of 2014 the plant’s production assets will be deployed to other north american metal food and household products packaging facilities 

  

aerospace and technologies segment 

  

ball’s aerospace and technologies segment which accounted for 11 percent of consolidated net sales in 2013 includes national defense hardware antenna and video component technologies civil and operational space hardware and systems engineering services the segment develops spacecraft sensors and instruments radio frequency systems and other advanced technologies for the civil commercial and national security aerospace markets the majority of the aerospace and technologies business involves work under contracts generally from one to five years in duration as a prime contractor or subcontractor for the us department of defense dod the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and other us government agencies the company competes against both large and small prime contractors and subcontractors for these contracts contracts funded by the various agencies of the federal government represented 94 percent of segment sales in 2013 

  

intense competition and long operating cycles are key characteristics of both the company’s business and the aerospace and defense industry it is common in the aerospace and defense industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to another competitor become a subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting company it is not unusual to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or a customer of that same competitor on other contracts or vice versa 

  

geopolitical events and shifting executive and legislative branch priorities have resulted in an increase in opportunities over the past decade in areas matching our aerospace and technologies segment’s core capabilities in space hardware the businesses include hardware software and services sold primarily to us customers with emphasis on space science and exploration environmental and earth sciences and defense and intelligence applications major activities frequently involve the design manufacture and testing of satellites remote sensors and ground station control hardware and software as well as related services such as launch vehicle integration and satellite operations uncertainties in the federal government budgeting process could delay the funding or even result in cancellation of certain programs currently in our reported backlog 

  

other hardware activities include target identification warning and attitude control systems and components cryogenic systems for reactant storage and associated sensor cooling devices star trackers which are generalpurpose stellar attitude sensors and faststeering mirrors additionally the aerospace and technologies segment provides diversified technical services and products to government agencies prime contractors and commercial organizations for a broad range of information warfare electronic warfare avionics intelligence training and space systems needs 

  

  

backlog in the aerospace and technologies segment was 938 million and 10 billion at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively and consisted of the aggregate contract value of firm orders excluding amounts previously recognized as revenue the 2013 backlog includes 578 million expected to be recognized in revenues during 2014 with the remainder expected to be recognized in revenues thereafter unfunded amounts included in backlog for certain firm government orders which are subject to annual funding were 470 million and 573 million at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively yearoveryear comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations due to the nature of varying delivery and milestone schedules on contracts and funding of programs 

  

patents 

  

in the opinion of the company’s management none of our active patents or groups of patents is material to the successful operation of our business as a whole we manage our intellectual property portfolio to obtain the durations necessary to achieve our business objectives 

  

research and development 

  

research and development rd efforts in our packaging segments are primarily directed toward packaging innovation specifically the development of new features sizes shapes and types of containers as well as new uses for existing containers other additional rd efforts in these segments seek to improve manufacturing efficiencies and the overall sustainability of our products our packaging rd activities are primarily conducted in the ball technology  innovation center btic located in westminster colorado and in a technical center located in bonn germany 

  

in our aerospace business we continue to focus our rd activities on the design development and manufacture of innovative aerospace products and systems this includes the production of spacecraft instruments and sensors radio frequency and system components data exploitation solutions and a variety of advanced aerospace technologies and products that enable deep space missions our aerospace rd activities are conducted at various locations in the us 

  

additional information regarding company rd activity is contained in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report as well as in item 2 “properties” 

  

sustainability and the environment 

  

sustainability is a key part of maximizing value at ball in our global operations we focus our sustainability efforts on employee safety and reducing energy water waste and air emissions in addition to those operational priorities we identified innovation packaging recycling talent management responsible sourcing and community engagement as priorities for our corporate sustainability efforts by continuously working toward reducing the environmental impacts of our products throughout their life cycle we also improve our financial results information about our corporate sustainability management goals and performance data are available at wwwballcomsustainability 

  

the biggest opportunity to further minimize the environmental impacts of metal packaging is to increase recycling rates aluminum and steel are infinitely recyclable materials and metal packaging is already the most recycled packaging in the world by using recycled material for the production of aluminum and steel up to 95 percent of the energy used for the production of virgin material can be saved in some of ball’s markets such as brazil china and several european countries recycling rates for beverage containers are at or above 90 percent recycling rates in europe for 2011 averaged around 68 percent for aluminum beverage containers and 74 percent for steel containers the 2012 recycling rate in the us was 67 percent for aluminum beverage containers and 71 percent for steel containers 

  

in several of ball’s markets we help establish and financially support recycling initiatives educating consumers about the benefits of recycling aluminum and steel containers and collaborating with industry partners to create effective collection and recycling systems contribute to increased recycling rates for more details about programs we support please visit wwwballcomrecycling

 item 1a risk factors 

  

any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

our business operating results and financial condition are subject to particular risks in certain regions of the world 

  

we may experience an operating loss in one or more regions of the world for one or more periods which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition moreover overcapacity which often leads to lower prices exists in a number of the regions in which we operate and may persist even if demand grows our ability to manage such operational fluctuations and to maintain adequate longterm strategies in the face of such developments will be critical to our continued growth and profitability 

  

there can be no assurance that the company’s business acquisitions will be successfully integrated into the acquiring company see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report for details of acquisitions made during the three years ended december 31 2013 

  

while we have what we believe to be well designed integration plans if we cannot successfully integrate the acquired operations with those of ball we may experience material negative consequences to our business financial condition or results of operations the integration of companies that have previously been operated separately involves a number of risks including but not limited to 

  

·   demands on management related to the increase in our size after the acquisition 

·   the diversion of management’s attention from the management of existing operations to the integration of the acquired operations 

·   difficulties in the assimilation and retention of employees 

·   difficulties in the integration of departments systems including accounting systems technologies books and records and procedures as well as in maintaining uniform standards controls including internal accounting controls procedures and policies 

·   expenses related to any undisclosed or potential liabilities and 

·   retention of major customers and suppliers 

  

we may not be able to achieve potential synergies or maintain the levels of revenue earnings or operating efficiency that each business had achieved or might achieve separately the successful integration of the acquired operations will depend on our ability to manage those operations realize revenue opportunities and to some degree eliminate redundant and excess costs 

  

  

the loss of a key customer or a reduction in its requirements could have a significant negative impact on our sales 

  

we sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major beverage packaged food personal care and household product companies some of which operate in north america south america europe and asia 

  

although the majority of our customer contracts are longterm these contracts unless they are renewed expire in accordance with their respective terms and are terminable under certain circumstances such as our failure to meet quality volume or market pricing requirements because we depend on relatively few major customers our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss of any of these customers a reduction in the purchasing levels of these customers a strike or work stoppage by a significant number of these customers’ employees or an adverse change in the terms of the supply agreements with these customers 

  

the primary customers for our aerospace segment are us government agencies or their prime contractors our contracts with these customers are subject to several risks including funding cuts and delays technical uncertainties budget changes competitive activity and changes in scope 

  

we face competitive risks from many sources that may negatively impact our profitability 

  

competition within the packaging and aerospace industries is intense increases in productivity combined with existing or potential surplus capacity in the industry have maintained competitive pricing pressures the principal methods of competition in the general packaging industry are price innovation and sustainability service and quality in the aerospace industry they are technical capability cost and schedule some of our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources and some may currently have significant excess capacity our current or potential competitors may offer products at a lower price or products that are deemed superior to ours the global economic environment has resulted in reductions in demand for our products in some instances which in turn could increase these competitive pressures 

  

we are subject to competition from alternative products which could result in lower profits and reduced cash flows 

  

our metal packaging products are subject to significant competition from substitute products particularly plastic carbonated soft drink bottles made from pet single serve beer bottles and other food and beverage containers made of glass cardboard or other materials competition from plastic carbonated soft drink bottles is particularly intense in the us europe and the prc certain of our aerospace products are also subject to competition from alternative products and solutions there can be no assurance that our products will successfully compete against alternative products which could result in a reduction in our profits or cash flow 

  

our packaging businesses have a narrow product range and our business would suffer if usage of our products decreased or if decreases occur in the demand for the beverages food and other goods filled in our products 

  

for the year ended december 31 2013 71 percent of our consolidated net sales were from the sale of metal beverage containers and we expect to derive a significant portion of our future revenues and cash flows from the sale of metal beverage containers our business would suffer if the use of metal beverage containers decreased accordingly broad acceptance by consumers of aluminum and steel containers for a wide variety of beverages is critical to our future success if demand for glass and pet bottles increases relative to metal containers the demand for aluminum and steel containers does not develop as expected or declines in consumption of carbonated soft drinks in north america continue our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

  

changes in laws and governmental regulations may adversely affect our business and operations 

  

we and our customers and suppliers are subject to various federal state and provincial laws and regulations which are increasing in number and complexity each of our and their facilities is subject to federal state provincial and local licensing and regulation by health environmental workplace safety and other agencies in multiple jurisdictions requirements of worldwide governmental authorities with respect to manufacturing manufacturing facility locations within the jurisdiction product content and safety climate change workplace safety and health environmental expropriation of assets and other standards could adversely affect our ability to manufacture or sell our products and the ability of our customers and suppliers to manufacture and sell their products in addition we face risks arising from compliance with and enforcement of increasingly numerous and complex federal state country and provincial laws and regulations 

  

  

enacted regulatory developments regarding the reporting and use of “conflict minerals” mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of certain of our products as a result there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflictfree materials and we cannot give assurance that we will be able to obtain such products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices also because our supply chain is complex we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of all materials used in the products that we sell the compliance and reporting aspects of these regulations may result in incremental costs to the company 

  

while deposit systems and other containerrelated legislation have been adopted in some jurisdictions similar legislation has been defeated in public referenda and legislative bodies in many others we anticipate that continuing efforts will be made to consider and adopt such legislation in the future the packages we produce are widely used and perform well in us states canadian provinces and european countries that have deposit systems as well as in other countries worldwide 

  

significant environmental employmentrelated and other legislation and regulatory requirements exist and are also evolving the compliance costs associated with current and proposed laws and potential regulations could be substantial and any failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws or regulations could lead to litigation or governmental action all of which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

  

our business financial condition and results of operations are subject to risks resulting from broader geographic operations 

  

we derived approximately 40 percent of our consolidated net sales from outside of the us for the year ended december 31 2013 the sizeable scope of operations outside of the us may lead to more volatile financial results and make it more difficult for us to manage our business reasons for this include but are not limited to the following 

  

·   political and economic instability 

·   governments’ restrictive trade policies 

·   the imposition or rescission of duties taxes or government royalties 

·   exchange rate risks 

·   difficulties in enforcement of contractual obligations and intellectual property rights and 

·   the geographic language and cultural differences between personnel in different areas of the world 

  

any of these factors many of which are also present in the us could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

we are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations 

  

our reporting currency is the us dollar a portion of ball’s operations including assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses have been denominated in various transaction currencies other than the us dollar and we expect such operations will continue to be so denominated as a result the us dollar value of these operations has varied and will continue to vary with exchange rate fluctuations a decrease in the value of the various currencies compared to the us dollar could reduce our profits from these operations and the value of their net assets when reported in us dollars in our financial statements this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations as reported in us dollars in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to currencies in which the earnings are generated may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations 

  

we manage our exposure to currency fluctuations particularly our exposure to fluctuations in the euro to us dollar exchange rate in order to attempt to mitigate the effect of cash flow and earnings volatility associated with exchange rate changes we primarily use forward contracts and options to manage our currency exposures and as a result we experience gains and losses on these derivative positions offset in part by the impact of currency fluctuations on existing assets and liabilities our inability to properly manage our exposure to currency fluctuations could materially impact our results 

  

if we fail to retain key management and personnel we may be unable to implement our key objectives 

  

we believe that our future success depends in part on our experienced management team unforeseen losses of key members of our management team without appropriate succession andor compensation planning could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet our objectives 

  

  

decreases in our ability to apply new technology and knowhow may affect our competitiveness 

  

our success depends partially on our ability to improve production processes and services we must also introduce new products and services to meet changing customer needs if we are unable to implement better production processes or to develop new products through research and development or licensing of new technology we may not be able to remain competitive with other manufacturers as a result our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

adverse weather and climate changes may result in lower sales 

  

we manufacture packaging products primarily for beverages and foods unseasonably cool weather can reduce demand for certain beverages packaged in our containers in addition poor weather conditions or changes in climate that reduce crop yields of fruits and vegetables can adversely affect demand for our food containers climate change could have various effects on the demand for our products in different regions around the world 

  

we are vulnerable to fluctuations in the supply and price of raw materials 

  

we purchase aluminum steel and other raw materials and packaging supplies from several sources while all such materials are available from independent suppliers raw materials are subject to fluctuations in price and availability attributable to a number of factors including general economic conditions commodity price fluctuations particularly aluminum on the london metal exchange the demand by other industries for the same raw materials and the availability of complementary and substitute materials although we enter into commodities purchase agreements from time to time and sometimes use derivative instruments to seek to manage our risk we cannot ensure that our current suppliers of raw materials will be able to supply us with sufficient quantities at reasonable prices economic and financial factors could impact our suppliers thereby causing supply shortages increases in raw material costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in the americas europe and asia some contracts do not allow us to pass along increased raw material costs and we generally use derivative agreements to seek to manage this risk our hedging procedures may be insufficient and our results could be materially impacted if costs of materials increase due to the fixed price contracts and derivative activities while increasing raw material costs may not impact our nearterm profitability increased prices could decrease our sales volume over time 

  

prolonged work stoppages at facilities with union employees could jeopardize our financial position 

  

as of december 31 2013 approximately 40 percent of our north american packaging facility employees and approximately 75 percent of our european employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements these collective bargaining agreements have staggered expirations during the next several years although we consider our employee relations to be generally good a prolonged work stoppage or strike at any facility with union employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition we cannot ensure that upon the expiration of existing collective bargaining agreements new agreements will be reached without union action or that any such new agreements will be on terms satisfactory to us 

  

our aerospace and technologies segment is subject to certain risks specific to that business 

  

in our aerospace business us government contracts are subject to reduction or modification in the event of changes in requirements and the government may also terminate contracts at its convenience pursuant to standard termination provisions in such instances ball may be entitled to reimbursement for allowable cost and profits on authorized work that has been performed through the date of termination 

  

in addition budgetary constraints may result in further reductions to projected spending levels by the us government in particular government expenditures are subject to the potential for automatic reductions generally referred to as “sequestration” sequestration may occur in any given year resulting in significant additional reductions to spending by various us government defense and aerospace agencies on both existing and new contracts as well as the disruption of ongoing programs even if sequestration does not occur we expect that budgetary constraints and ongoing concerns regarding the us national debt will continue to place downward pressure on agency spending levels due to these and other factors overall spending on various programs could decline which could result in significant reductions to revenue cash flows net earnings and backlog primarily in our aerospace and technologies segment 

  

  

we use estimates in accounting for many of our programs in our aerospace business and changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results 

  

we account for sales and profits on some longterm contracts in our aerospace business in accordance with the percentageofcompletion method of accounting using the cumulative catchup method to account for updates in estimates the percentageofcompletion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project revenues and costs at completion and various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events including the quantity and timing of product deliveries future labor performance and rates and material and overhead costs these assumptions involve various levels of expected performance improvements under the cumulative catchup method the impact of updates in our estimates related to units shipped to date is recognized immediately 

  

because of the significance of the judgments and estimates described above it is likely that we could record materially different amounts if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances or estimates were to change accordingly updates in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates may materially affect our future financial performance 

  

our backlog includes both costtype and fixedprice contracts costtype contracts generally have lower profit margins than fixedprice contracts our earnings and margins may vary depending on the types of government contracts undertaken the nature of the work performed under those contracts the costs incurred in performing the work the achievement of other performance objectives and their impact on our ability to receive fees 

  

as a us government contractor we could be adversely affected by changes in regulations or any negative findings from a us government audit or investigation 

  

we operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its agencies such as the defense contract audit agency dcaa and defense contract management agency dcma these agencies review performance under our contracts our cost structure and our compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies systems that are subject to review under the new dod federal acquisition regulation supplement dfars effective may 18 2011 are accounting and billing systems purchasing systems estimating systems material management and accounting systems and earned value management systems any costs ultimately found to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if already reimbursed if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties sanctions or suspension or debarment from doing business with the us government whether or not illegal activities are alleged the us government also has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate if such actions were to result in suspension or debarment this could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

our business is subject to substantial environmental remediation and compliance costs 

  

our operations are subject to federal state provincial and local laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions relating to environmental hazards such as emissions to air discharges to water the handling and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes and the cleanup of hazardous substances we have been designated along with numerous other companies as a potentially responsible party for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites based on available information we do not believe that any costs incurred in connection with such sites will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations capital expenditures or competitive position there is increased focus on the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental issues worldwide 

  

our business faces the potential of increased regulation on some of the raw materials utilized in our packaging operations 

  

our operations are subject to federal state provincial and local laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions relating to some of the raw materials such as epoxybased coatings utilized in our container making process epoxybased coatings may contain bisphenola bpa scientific evidence evaluated by regulatory agencies in the united states canada europe japan australia and new zealand has consistently shown these coatings to be safe for food contact at current levels and these regulatory agencies have stated that human exposure to bpa from epoxybased container coatings is well below safe exposure limits set by government bodies worldwide a significant change in these regulatory agency statements or other adverse information concerning bpa could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations ball recognizes that significant interest exists in non epoxybased coatings and we have been proactively working with coatings suppliers and our customers to evaluate alternatives to current coatings 

  

  

net earnings and net worth could be materially affected by an impairment of goodwill 

  

we have a significant amount of goodwill recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2013 we are required at least annually to test the recoverability of goodwill the recoverability test of goodwill is based on the current fair value of our identified reporting units fair value measurement requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors including revenue and market growth operating cash flows and discount rates if general market conditions deteriorate in portions of our business we could experience a significant decline in the fair value of reporting units this decline could lead to an impairment of all or a significant portion of the goodwill balance which could materially affect our us gaap net earnings and net worth 

  

if the investments in ball’s pension plans or in the multiemployer pension plans in which ball participates do not perform as expected we may have to contribute additional amounts to the plans which would otherwise be available to cover operating expenses and fund growth opportunities 

  

ball maintains defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of its north american and united kingdom employees which are funded based on certain actuarial assumptions the plans’ assets consist primarily of common stocks fixed income securities and in the us alternative investments market declines longevity increases or legislative changes such as the pension protection act in the us could result in a prospective decrease in our available cash flow and net earnings over time and the recognition of an increase in our pension obligations could result in a reduction to our shareholders’ equity additional risks exist related to the company’s participation in multiemployer pension plans assets contributed to a multiemployer pension plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers if a participating employer in a multiemployer pension plan stops contributing to the plan the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participants this could result in increases to our contributions to the plans as well as pension expense 

  

restricted access to capital markets could adversely affect our shortterm liquidity and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the notes issued pursuant to our bond indentures 

  

on december 31 2013 we had total debt of 36 billion and unused committed credit lines of approximately 887 million a reduction in global market liquidity could 

  

·   restrict our ability to fund working capital capital expenditures research and development expenditures and other business activities 

·   increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions including the credit risks stemming from the economic environment 

·   limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate 

·   restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities and 

·   limit along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt among other things our ability to borrow additional funds dispose of assets pay cash dividends or refinance debt maturities 

  

if market interest rates increase our variablerate debt will create higher debt service requirements which would adversely affect our cash flow while we sometimes enter into agreements limiting our exposure any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk 

  

the global credit financial and economic environment could have a negative impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

the overall credit financial and economic environment could have significant negative effects on our operations including the following 

  

·   the creditworthiness of customers suppliers and counterparties could deteriorate resulting in a financial loss or a disruption in our supply of raw materials 

·   volatile market performance could affect the fair value of our pension assets potentially requiring us to make significant additional contributions to our defined benefit plans to maintain prescribed funding levels 

·   a significant weakening of our financial position or operating results could result in noncompliance with our debt covenants and 

·   reduced cash flow from our operations could adversely affect our ability to execute our longterm strategy to increase liquidity reduce debt repurchase our stock and invest in our businesses 

  

  

changes in us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap and securities and exchange commission sec rules and regulations could materially impact our reported results 

  

us gaap and sec accounting and reporting changes are common and have become more frequent and significant over the past several years furthermore the us and international accounting standard setters are in the process of jointly converging several key accounting standards these changes could have significant effects on our reported results when compared to prior periods and other companies and may even require us to retrospectively adjust prior periods additionally material changes to the presentation of transactions in the consolidated financial statements could impact key ratios that analysts and credit rating agencies use to rate ball and ultimately our ability to access the credit markets in an efficient manner 

  

increased information technology it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems networks products solutions and services 

  

increased global it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including employee training comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems networks products solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats depending on their nature and scope such threats could potentially lead to the compromise of confidential information improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which in turn could adversely affect our reputation competitiveness and results of operations

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

management’s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k which include additional information about our accounting policies practices and the transactions underlying our financial results the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes including various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits taxes environmental and other matters arising during the normal course of business we apply our best judgment our knowledge of existing facts and circumstances and actions that we may undertake in the future in determining the estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances such as current economic conditions and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change as future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision actual results may differ from these estimates ball corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as “ball corporation” “ball” “the company” or “we” or “our” in the following discussion and analysis   overview   

business overview and industry trends 

  

ball corporation is one of the world’s leading suppliers of metal packaging to the beverage food personal care and household products industries our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses are manufactured in facilities around the world and are competitive with other substrates such as plastics and glass in the rigid packaging industry sales and earnings can be increased by reducing costs increasing prices developing new products expanding volumes and making strategic acquisitions we also provide aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers 

  

we sell our packaging products mainly to large multinational beverage food personal care and household products companies with which we have developed longterm customer relationships this is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of longterm supply contracts while we have a diversified customer base we sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major companies in north america europe the prc and south america as do our equity joint ventures in the us and vietnam the overall metal container industry is growing globally and is expected to continue to grow in the medium to long term despite the north american industry seeing a continued decline in standardsized aluminum beverage packaging for the carbonated soft drink market the primary customers for the products and services provided by our aerospace and technologies segment are us government agencies or their prime contractors 

  

we purchase our raw materials from relatively few suppliers we also have exposure to inflation in particular the rising costs of raw materials as well as other direct cost inputs we mitigate our exposure to the changes in the costs of metal through the inclusion of provisions in contracts covering the majority of our volumes to pass through metal price changes as well as through the use of derivative instruments the passthrough provisions generally result in proportional increases or decreases in sales and costs with a greatly reduced impact if any on net earnings because of our customer and supplier concentration our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss insolvency or bankruptcy of a major customer or supplier or a change in a supply agreement with a major customer or supplier although our contract provisions generally mitigate the risk of customer loss and our longterm relationships represent a known stable customer base 

  

we recognize sales under longterm contracts in the aerospace and technologies segment using percentageofcompletion under the costtocost method of accounting throughout the period of contract performance we regularly reevaluate and if necessary revise our estimates of aerospace and technologies total contract revenue total contract cost and progress toward completion because of contract payment schedules limitations on funding and other contract terms our sales and accounts receivable for this segment include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed 

  

  

corporate strategy 

  

our drive for 10 vision encompasses five strategic levers that are key to growing our business and achieving longterm success since we launched in 2011 we made progress on each of our drive for 10 levers as described in the following 

  

·   maximizing value in our existing businesses through rationalizing standard beverage container and end capacity in north america and the expansion of specialty container production to meet current demand redeployment of surplus equipment to other global locations closure of certain metal beverage and metal food and aerosol packaging facilities relocating our european headquarters to zurich switzerland to gain business customer and supplier efficiencies and costout and valuein initiatives across all of our businesses

  

·   expanding further into new products and capabilities through expansion into extruded aluminum aerosol manufacturing with our mexican acquisition in december 2012 and aerocan in january 2011 successful commercialization of our lightweighted extruded aluminum aerosol can that utilizes a significant amount of recycled material

  

·   aligning ourselves with the right customers and markets by investing capital to meet doubledigit volume growth for specialty beverage containers throughout the global network and the addition of a second can line in our alagoinhas brazil aluminum beverage container facility

  

·   broadening our geographic reach with the construction and start up of three beverage container manufacturing facilities in china brazil and vietnam as well as the award of a south korean environmental instrument in our aerospace business and

  

·   leveraging our technological expertise in packaging innovation and aerospace technologies to maintain our competitive advantage today and in the future

  

these ongoing business developments help us stay close to our customers while expanding andor sustaining our industry positions with major beverage food personal care household products and aerospace customers 

  

results of operations 

  

consolidated sales and earnings 

  

   

the decrease in net sales in 2013 compared to 2012 was driven largely by lower demand for standard 12ounce aluminum beverage containers in the us partially offset by specialty can growth in the americas and higher sales volumes in europe brazil and the prc earnings were flat compared to 2012 with lower standard 12ounce volumes in the us and higher selling general and administrative expenses being offset by higher specialty can volumes in the americas and improved cost management in our global packaging operations in addition to the business segment performance analyzed below net earnings attributable to ball corporation included lower business consolidation and other activities higher debt refinancing costs and a lower tax rate in 2013 these items are detailed in the “management performance measures” section below 

  

the increase in net sales in 2012 compared to 2011 was driven largely by higher sales in aerospace and higher beverage container sales volumes in certain geographical regions being offset by lower sales volumes in food and household containers and unfavorable currency translation effects in europe earnings were favorably impacted by higher sales volumes in certain geographical regions improved pricing and product sales mix and continued yearoveryear improvement in our manufacturing costs while negatively impacted by higher distribution and warehousing costs and new facility startup costs in other markets 

  

  

cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization 

  

cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization was 68754 million in 2013 compared to 71740 million in 2012 and 70812 million in 2011 these amounts represented 812 percent 821 percent and 820 percent of consolidated net sales for those three years respectively 

  

depreciation and amortization 

  

depreciation and amortization expense was 2999 million in 2013 compared to 2829 million in 2012 and 3011 million in 2011 these amounts represented 35 percent 32 percent and 35 percent of consolidated net sales for those three years respectively the higher depreciation and amortization expense in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to capital spending in excess of historical levels and changes in currency exchange rates the lower depreciation and amortization expense in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to the revision of estimated useful lives of certain capital equipment and tooling further details of the revised estimated lives are available in note 1 accompanying the consolidated financial statements included within item 8 of this report 

  

selling general and administrative 

  

selling general and administrative sga expenses were 4186 million in 2013 compared to 3855 million in 2012 and 3814 million in 2011 these amounts represented 49 percent 44 percent and 44 percent of consolidated net sales for those three years respectively the higher expenses in 2013 were largely related to the reassessment of certain expenses in europe from cost of sales to sga in light of the relocation of the european headquarters 

  

interest expense 

  

consolidated interest expense was 2118 million in 2013 compared to 1949 million in 2012 and 1771 million in 2011 excluding debt refinancing costs interest expense in 2013 was higher than in 2012 due to higher average debt levels and the timing difference of the issuance of 1 billion senior notes due in 2023 versus the tender and call of the 2016 senior notes partially offset by lower average borrowing rates interest expense in 2012 was slightly higher than in 2011 due to higher levels of debt including the issuance in march 2012 of 750 million of senior notes due in 2022 partially offset by lower interest rates interest expense as a percentage of average monthly borrowings was 51 percent in 2013 55 percent in 2012 and 54 percent in 2011 

  

interest expense in 2013 included 280 million for the tender and call premiums as well as the write off of unamortized financing costs and issuance discounts related to the tender of our 7125 percent senior notes due in september 2016 the repayment of the term a loan and the amendment and extension of the senior credit facilities interest expense in 2012 included 151 million for the call premium and the write off of unamortized financing costs and issuance premiums related to the tender of ball’s 6625 percent senior notes due in march 2018 

  

tax provision 

  

the effective income tax rate for earnings from continuing operations was 256 percent in 2013 compared to 277 percent in 2012 and 305 percent in 2011 the lower tax rate in 2013 was primarily the result of the retroactive extension of the us research and development credit a lower state effective tax rate and a higher foreign tax rate differential partially offset by higher us taxes on foreign earnings and the 2012 releases of uncertain tax positions which exceeded those occurring in 2013 the lower rate in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily the net result of the release of various income tax reserves effectively settled with taxing jurisdictions lower us taxes on foreign earnings and an increased tax benefit related to company and trustowned life insurance 

  

equity in results of affiliates 

  

in october 2011 we acquired our partners’ 60 percent equity interests in qmcp and recorded a gain of 92 million on the fair value of our previously held equity ownership as a result of the required purchased accounting additionally in march 2011 we entered into a joint venture agreement with thai beverage can limited to construct a beverage container manufacturing facility in vietnam that began production in the first quarter of 2012 

  

  

results of business segments 

  

ball’s operations are organized and reviewed by management along its product lines and geographical areas and presented in the four reportable segments discussed below on january 1 2013 the company implemented changes to its management and internal reporting structure as a result the european extruded aluminum business which was previously included in the metal beverage packaging europe segment is now included in the metal food and household products packaging segment the segment results and disclosures for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 and the financial position at december 31 2012 have been retrospectively adjusted to conform to the current year presentation 

  

metal beverage packaging americas and asia 

  

   

a   further details of these items are included in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

  

the metal beverage packaging americas and asia segment consists of operations located in the us canada brazil and the prc which manufacture metal container products used in beverage packaging as well as nonbeverage plastic containers manufactured and sold in the prc our acquisition of the remaining 60 percent interest in qmcp was completed in october 2011

other liquidity measures 

  

management performance measures 

  

management internally uses various measures to evaluate company performance such as return on average invested capital net operating earnings after tax over the relevant performance period divided by average invested capital over the same period economic value added eva® dollars net operating earnings after tax less a capital charge on average invested capital employed earnings before interest and taxes ebit earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda diluted earnings per share cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow generally defined by the company as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditureswe believe this information is also useful to investors as it provides insight into the earnings and cash flow criteria management uses to make strategic decisions these financial measures may be adjusted at times for items that affect comparability between periods such as business consolidation costs and gains or losses on acquisitions and dispositions 

  

nonfinancial measures in the packaging businesses include production efficiency and spoilage rates quality control figures environmental health and safety statistics production and sales volumes asset utilization rates and measures of sustainability additional measures used to evaluate financial performance in the aerospace and technologies segment include contract revenue realization award and incentive fees realized proposal win rates and backlog including awarded contracted and funded backlog 

  

the following financial measurements are on a nonus gaap basis and should be considered in connection with the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report nonus gaap measures should not be considered in isolation and should not be considered superior to or a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with us gaap a presentation of earnings in accordance with us gaap is available in item 8 of this annual report

free cash flow 

  

management internally uses a free cash flow measure 1 to evaluate the company’s operating results 2 to evaluate strategic investments 3 to plan stock buyback and dividend levels and 4 to evaluate the company’s ability to incur and service debt free cash flow is not a defined term under us gaap and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures the company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures free cash flow is typically derived directly from the company’s consolidated statement of cash flows however it may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods 

  

based on the above definition our consolidated free cash flow is summarized as follows 

  

   

based on information currently available we estimate cash flows from operating activities for 2014 to be in the range of 925 million capital expenditures to be approximately 375 million and free cash flow to be in the range of 550 million in 2014 we intend to utilize our operating cash flow to fund our stock repurchases dividend payments growth capital projects and to the extent available acquisitions that meet our various criteria of the total 2014 estimated capital expenditures approximately 100 million was contractually committed as of december 31 2013 

  

  

commitments 

  

cash payments required for longterm debt maturities rental payments under noncancellable operating leases purchase obligations and other commitments in effect at december 31 2013 are summarized in the following table 

  

   

a   amounts reported in local currencies have been translated at yearend 2013 exchange rates 

b   for variable rate facilities amounts are based on interest rates in effect at year end and do not contemplate the effects of any hedging instruments utilized by the company 

c   the company’s purchase obligations include contracted amounts for aluminum steel and other direct materials also included are commitments for purchases of natural gas and electricity expenses related to aerospace and technologies contracts and other less significant items in cases where variable prices andor usage are involved management’s best estimates have been used depending on the circumstances early termination of the contracts may or may not result in penalties and therefore actual payments could vary significantly 

  

the table above does not include 783 million of uncertain tax positions the timing of which is unknown at this time 

  

contributions to the company’s defined benefit pension plans not including the unfunded german plans are expected to be in the range of 65 million in 2014 this estimate may change based on changes in the pension protection act and actual plan asset performance and available company cash flow among other factors benefit payments related to these plans are expected to be 811 million 845 million 880 million 925 million and 966 million for the years ending december 31 2014 through 2018 respectively and a total of 5366 million for the years 2019 through 2023 payments to participants in the unfunded german plans are expected to be between 21 million and 23 million in each of the years 2014 through 2018 and a total of 100 million for the years 2019 through 2023 

  

based on changes in return on asset and discount rate assumptions as well as revisions based on plan experience studies total pension expense in 2014 is anticipated to be approximately 10 million lower than in 2013 excluding curtailment expenses a reduction of the expected return on pension assets assumption by one quarter of a percentage point would result in an estimated 39 million increase in the 2014 pension expense while a quarter of a percentage point reduction in the discount rate applied to the pension liability would result in an estimated 65 million of additional pension expense in 2014 additional information regarding the company’s pension plans is provided in note 14 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

  

due to the us tax status of certain of ball’s subsidiaries in canada and the prc the company annually provides us taxes on foreign earnings in those subsidiaries net of any estimated foreign tax credits the company also provides deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings in its brazil investment related to its 10 percent indirectly held investment net us taxes provided for brazil canada and prc earnings in 2013 2012 and 2011 were 264 million 73 million and 223 million respectively for the foreseeable future anticipated cash flow from the us operations should be sufficient to meet the domestic operational needs including capital expenditures dividends share repurchases and debt service including minimal near term debt maturities over the next few years should domestic cash flow gaps arise due to unforeseen events ball can access funds in the us to bridge those gaps from its committed revolving credit facility from public bond markets from cash deposits in the prc on earnings for which us taxes have been provided and from repayment of outstanding us loans to foreign subsidiaries consequently management’s intention is to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of ball’s remaining foreign investments and as a result no us income or federal withholding tax provision has been made it is not practical to estimate the additional taxes that may become payable upon the eventual remittance of these foreign earnings however repatriation of these earnings would result in a relatively high incremental tax rate

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

financial instruments and risk management 

  

the company employs established risk management policies and procedures which seek to reduce the company’s commercial risk exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices interest rates currency exchange rates and prices of the company’s common stock with regard to common share repurchases and the company’s deferred compensation stock plan however there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be successful although the instruments utilized involve varying degrees of credit market and interest risk the counterparties to the agreements are expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements the company monitors counterparty credit risk including lenders on a regular basis but ball cannot be certain that all risks will be discerned or that its risk management policies and procedures will always be effective additionally in the event of default under the company’s master derivative agreements the nondefaulting party has the option to setoff any amounts owed with regard to open derivative positions further details are available in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

  

we have estimated our market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis market risk exposure has been defined as the changes in fair value of derivative instruments financial instruments and commodity positions to test the sensitivity of our market risk exposure we have estimated the changes in fair value of market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in market prices or rates the results of the sensitivity analyses are summarized below 

  

commodity price risk   

aluminum 

  

we manage commodity price risk in connection with market price fluctuations of aluminum ingot through two different methods first we enter into container sales contracts that include aluminum ingotbased pricing terms that generally reflect the same price fluctuations included in commercial purchase contracts for aluminum sheet the terms include fixed floating or passthrough aluminum ingot component pricing second we use derivative instruments such as option and forward contracts as economic and cash flow hedges of commodity price risk where there is not an arrangement in the sales contract to match underlying purchase volumes and pricing with sales volumes and pricing 

  

steel 

  

most sales contracts involving our steel products either include provisions permitting us to pass through some or all steel cost changes incurred or they incorporate annually negotiated steel prices we anticipate at this time that we will be able to pass through the majority of any steel price changes that may occur in 2014 

  

considering the effects of derivative instruments the company’s ability to pass through certain raw material costs through contractual provisions the market’s ability to accept price increases and the company’s commodity price exposures under its contract terms a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the company’s steel and aluminum prices could result in an estimated 57 million aftertax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period additionally the company has currency exposures on raw materials and the effect of a 10 percent adverse change is included in the total currency exposure discussed below actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates 

  

other 

  

the company is also exposed to fluctuations in prices for natural gas and electricity as well as the cost of diesel fuel as a component of freight cost a hypothetical 10 percent increase in our natural gas and electricity prices could result in an estimated 75 million aftertax reduction of net earnings over a oneyear period a hypothetical 10 percent increase in diesel fuel prices could result in an estimated 05 million aftertax reduction of net earnings over the same period actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates 

  

  

interest rate risk 

  

our objective in managing exposure to interest rate changes is to manage the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to minimize our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we may use a variety of interest rate swaps collars and options to manage our mix of floating and fixedrate debt interest rate instruments held by the company at december 31 2013 included payfixed interest rate swaps which effectively convert variable rate obligations to fixedrate instruments 

  

based on our interest rate exposure at december 31 2013 assumed floating rate debt levels throughout the next 12 months and the effects of derivative instruments a 100basis point increase in interest rates could result in an estimated 43 million aftertax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates and the timing of these changes 

  

currency exchange rate risk   

our objective in managing exposure to currency fluctuations is to limit the exposure of cash flows and earnings from changes associated with currency exchange rate changes through the use of various derivative contracts in addition at times ball manages earnings translation volatility through the use of currency option strategies and the change in the fair value of those options is recorded in the company’s net earnings our currency translation risk results from the currencies in which we transact business the company faces currency exposures in our global operations as a result of various factors including intercompany loans denominated in various currencies selling our products in various currencies purchasing raw materials in various currencies and tax exposures not denominated in the functional currency sales contracts are negotiated with customers to reflect cost changes and where there is not an exchange passthrough arrangement the company uses forward and option contracts to manage currency exposures 

  

considering the company’s derivative financial instruments outstanding at december 31 2013 currency exposures and currency exposures from the purchase and sale of raw materials a hypothetical 10 percent reduction us dollar strengthening in currency exchange rates compared to the us dollar could result in an estimated 467 million aftertax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period this hypothetical adverse change in currency exchange rates would also reduce our forecasted average debt balance by 271 million actual changes in market prices or rates may differ from hypothetical changes 

  

common stock price risk 

  

the company’s deferred compensation stock program is subject to variable plan accounting and accordingly is marked to fair value using the company’s closing stock price at the end of a reporting period based on current share levels in the program each 1 change in the company’s stock price has an impact of 14 million on pretax earnings during march and september 2011 the company entered into total return swaps to mitigate the company’s exposure to these fair value fluctuations that after renewals will be outstanding until march 2015 and september 2014 respectively the swaps have a notional value of 1 million shares and 300000 shares respectively

 item 1 business 

  

ball corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries ball we the company or our is one of the world’s leading suppliers of metal packaging to the beverage food personal care and household products industries the company was organized in 1880 and incorporated in the state of indiana united states of america us in 1922 our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses and are manufactured in facilities around the world we also provide aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers within our aerospace and technologies segment in 2012 our total consolidated net sales were 87 billion our packaging businesses were responsible for 90 percent of our net sales with the remaining 10 percent contributed by our aerospace business 

  

our largest product lines are aluminum and steel beverage containers we also produce steel food containers and steel and aluminum containers for beverages food personal care and household products as well as steel paint cans decorative steel tins and aluminum slugs 

  

we sell our packaging products mainly to major beverage food personal care and household products companies with which we have developed longterm customer relationships this is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of longterm supply contracts while we have a diversified customer base we sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major companies in north america europe the people’s republic of china prc brazil mexico and argentina as do our equity joint ventures in the us and vietnam our significant customers include anheuserbusch inbev nvsa heineken nv millercoors llc pepsico inc and its affiliated bottlers sabmiller plc the cocacola company and its affiliated bottlers and unilever nv 

  

our aerospace business is a leader in the design development and manufacture of innovative aerospace systems for civil commercial and national security aerospace markets it produces spacecraft instruments and sensors radio frequency systems and components data exploitation solutions and a variety of advanced aerospace technologies and products that enable deep space missions 

  

we are headquartered in broomfield colorado our stock is traded on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol bll 

  

our strategy 

  

our overall business strategy is defined by our drive for 10 vision which at its highest level is a mindset around perfection with a greater sense of urgency around our future success our drive for 10 vision encompasses five strategic levers that are key to growing our businesses and achieving longterm success these five levers are 

  

·   maximizing value in our existing businesses 

·   expanding into new products and capabilities 

·   aligning ourselves with the right customers and markets 

·   broadening our geographic reach and 

·   leveraging our knowhow and technological expertise to provide a competitive advantage 

  

we also maintain a clear and disciplined financial strategy focused on improving shareholder returns through 

  

·   delivering earnings per share growth of 10 percent to 15 percent per annum over the longterm 

·   focusing on free cash flow generation 

·   increasing economic value added eva® dollars 

  

the cash generated by our businesses is used primarily 1 to finance the company’s operations 2 to fund strategic capital investments 3 to fund stock buyback programs and dividend payments and 4 to service the company’s debt we will when we believe it will benefit the company and our shareholders make strategic acquisitions enter into joint ventures or divest parts of our company the compensation of many of our employees is tied directly to the company’s performance through our eva® incentive programs 

  

  

our reporting segments 

  

ball corporation reports its financial performance in four reportable segments 1 metal beverage packaging americas and asia 2 metal beverage packaging europe 3 metal food and household products packaging americas and 4 aerospace and technologies ball also has investments in the us and vietnam which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and accordingly those results are not included in segment sales or earnings financial information related to each of our segments is included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report on form 10k annual report 

  

metal beverage packaging americas and asia segment 

  

metal beverage packaging americas and asia is ball’s largest segment accounting for 52 percent of consolidated net sales in 2012 metal beverage containers are primarily sold under multiyear supply contracts to fillers of carbonated soft drinks beer energy drinks and other beverages 

  

americas 

  

metal beverage containers and ends are produced at 17 manufacturing facilities in the us one in canada and four in brazil ends are produced within four of the us facilities including two facilities that manufacture only ends and one facility in brazil additionally rocky mountain metal container llc a 50percent investment owned by ball and millercoors llc operates metal beverage container and end manufacturing facilities in golden colorado 

  

the north american metal beverage container manufacturing industry is relatively mature and industry volumes for certain types of containers have declined over the past several years where growth or contractions are projected in certain markets or for certain products ball undertakes selected capacity increases or decreases in its existing facilities to meet market demand which may include both permanent and temporary capacity realignment late in the second quarter of 2012 we were notified of a reduction in standard 12ounce container requirements for a beverage americas customer starting in january 2013 a meaningful portion of this reduction in volume will be offset with growing demand for specialty container volumes from new and existing customers we expanded our alumitek® bottle production to our golden colorado facility and expanded our specialty container capabilities in several of our facilities 

  

in august 2010 ball acquired an additional 101 percent economic interest in its brazilian metal beverage packaging joint venture latapackball embalagens ltda latapackball through a transaction with the joint venture partner latapack sa this transaction increased the company’s overall economic interest in the joint venture to 601 percent and resulted in ball becoming the primary beneficiary of the entity and consequently consolidating the joint venture in february 2011 we announced plans to construct a new metal beverage container manufacturing facility in northeast brazil which is one of the fastest growing regions of the country the new facility is located in alagoinhas bahia and began production in the first quarter of 2012 with the output from the first line contracted under a longterm agreement in december 2012 we announced the construction of a second can line in alagoinhas which is expected to begin production in the second half of 2013 

  

according to publicly available information and company estimates the combined americas metal beverage container industry represents approximately 116 billion units five companies manufacture substantially all of the metal beverage containers in the us and canada and three companies manufacture substantially all such containers in brazil two of these producers and three other independent producers also manufacture metal beverage containers in mexico ball produced approximately 43 billion recyclable metal beverage containers in the americas in 2012 — about 37 percent of the aggregate production sales volumes of metal beverage containers in north america tend to be highest during the period from april through september while in brazil sales volumes tend to be highest from september through december all of the beverage containers produced by ball in the us canada and brazil are made of aluminum as are almost all beverage containers produced by our competitors in those countries in 2012 we were able to recover substantially all aluminumrelated cost increases levied by sheet producers through either financial or contractual means in the metal beverage packaging americas segment six aluminum suppliers provide virtually all of our requirements 

  

metal beverage containers are sold based on price quality service innovation and sustainability in a highly competitive market which is relatively capital intensive and is characterized by facilities that run more or less continuously in order to operate profitably in addition the metal beverage container competes aggressively with other packaging materials the glass bottle has maintained a meaningful position in the packaged beer industry while the polyethylene terephthalate pet container has grown significantly in the carbonated soft drink and water industries over the past quarter century 

  

  

we believe we have limited our exposure related to changes in the costs of aluminum ingot as a result of the inclusion of provisions in most metal beverage container sales contracts to pass through aluminum ingot price changes as well as through the use of derivative instruments 

  

asia 

  

the metal beverage container market in the prc is approximately 19 billion containers of which ball’s operations represented an estimated 28 percent in 2012 our percentage of the industry makes us one of the largest manufacturers of metal beverage containers in the prc and we plan to prudently add capacity where necessary to continue to supply this growing market eight other manufacturers account for the remainder of the production our operations include the manufacture of aluminum containers and ends in five facilities in the prc we also manufacture and sell highdensity plastic containers in two prc facilities primarily servicing the motor oil industry 

  

in october 2011 we acquired our partners’ 60 percent interest in qingdao mc packaging ltd qmcp a joint venture metal beverage container facility in qingdao prc the facility was relocated and expanded in qingdao prc and began production in the second quarter of 2012 additionally in march 2011 we entered into a joint venture agreement with thai beverage can limited to construct a beverage container manufacturing facility in vietnam that began production in the first quarter of 2012 

  

in june 2010 we acquired guangdong jianlibao group co ltd’s 65 percent interest in a joint venture metal beverage container and end facility jfp in sanshui foshan prc ball had owned 35 percent of the joint venture facility since 1992 

  

we believe we have limited our exposure related to changes in the costs of aluminum ingot as a result of the inclusion of provisions in most metal beverage container sales contracts to pass through aluminum ingot price changes as well as through the use of derivative instruments 

  

metal beverage packaging europe segment 

  

the european metal beverage container market excluding russia is approximately 54 billion containers and we are the second largest producer with an estimated 32 percent of european shipments the european market is highly regional in terms of sales growth rates and packaging mix 

  

during the third quarter of 2012 we acquired tubettificio europeo spa tubettificio a small regional manufacturer of metal beverage packaging containers in italy and consolidated it into other existing facilities in january 2011 ball completed the acquisition of aerocan sas aerocan a leading european supplier of extruded aluminum aerosol containers for €2217 million 2952 million in cash and assumed debt which was net of 262 million of cash acquired the acquisition of aerocan has enabled ball to expand into a new product category that is growing faster than other parts of our business while aligning with a new customer base at returns that meet or exceed the company’s cost of capital see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report for further details 

  

the metal beverage packaging europe segment which accounted for 22 percent of ball’s consolidated net sales in 2012 supplies twopiece metal beverage containers and ends for producers of carbonated soft drinks beer energy drinks and other beverages as well as extruded aluminum aerosol containers and aluminum slugs the european operations consist of 16 facilities — 10 beverage container facilities three extruded aluminum aerosol facilities two beverage end facilities and one aluminum slug facility — of which four are located in germany four in the united kingdom four in france and one each in the netherlands poland serbia and the czech republic in addition ball is currently renting additional space on the premises of a supplier in haslach germany in order to produce the ball resealable end bre the european beverage facilities produced approximately 17 billion metal beverage containers in 2012 with approximately 57 percent of those being produced from aluminum and 43 percent from steel six of the beverage container facilities use aluminum and four use steel the european aluminum aerosol facilities produced approximately 725 million aluminum aerosol containers in 2012 

  

beginning in the first quarter of 2013 the european extruded aluminum packaging operations will be reflected in the metal food and household products packaging americas segment 

  

  

sales volumes of metal beverage containers in europe tend to be highest during the period from may through august with a smaller increase in demand leading up to the winter holiday season in the united kingdom much like other parts of the world the metal beverage container competes aggressively with other packaging materials used by the european beer and carbonated soft drink industries the glass bottle is heavily utilized in the packaged beer industry while the pet container is utilized in the carbonated soft drink beer juice and water industries 

  

european raw material supply contracts are generally for a period of one year although ball has negotiated some longer term agreements in europe three steel suppliers and two aluminum suppliers provide 94 percent of our requirements aluminum is traded primarily in us dollars while the functional currencies of the european operations are nonus dollars the company generally tries to minimize the resulting exchange rate risk using derivative and supply contracts in local currencies in addition purchase and sales contracts generally include fixed price floating and passthrough pricing arrangements 

  

metal food and household products packaging americas segment 

  

the metal food and household products packaging americas segment accounted for 16 percent of consolidated net sales in 2012 ball produces twopiece and threepiece steel food containers and ends for packaging vegetables fruit soups meat seafood nutritional products pet food and other products the segment also manufactures and sells aerosol paint and general line containers as well as decorative specialty containers extruded aluminum aerosol containers and aluminum slugs there are a total of 14 facilities in the us one in canada and one in mexico that produce these products in addition the company manufactures and sells steel aerosol containers in two facilities in argentina 

  

sales volumes of metal food containers in north america tend to be highest from may through october as a result of seasonal fruit vegetable and salmon packs we estimate our 2012 shipments of approximately 5 billion steel food containers to be approximately 17 percent of total us and canadian metal food container shipments we estimate our aerosol business accounts for approximately 39 percent of total annual us and canadian steel aerosol shipments in the us and canada we are the leading supplier of aluminum slugs used in the production of extruded aluminum aerosol containers and estimate our percentage of the total industry shipments to be approximately 87 percent 

  

in december 2012 the company acquired envases del plata sa de cv envases a leading producer of extruded aluminum aerosol packaging in mexico with a single manufacturing facility in san luis potosí for cash of 559 million net of cash acquired and assumed debt of 727 million the facility produces extruded aluminum aerosol containers for personal care and household products for customers in north central and south america and employs approximately 150 people the acquisition is expected to provide a platform to grow the company’s existing north american extruded aluminum business providing a new end market for the company’s products including the company’s real tm technology that enables the use of recycled material and meaningful lightweighting in the manufacture of extruded aluminum packaging 

  

competitors in the metal food container product line include two national and a small number of regional suppliers and self manufacturers several producers in mexico also manufacture steel food containers competition in the us steel aerosol container market primarily includes three other national suppliers steel containers also compete with other packaging materials in the food and household products industry including glass aluminum plastic paper and pouches as a result profitability for this product line is dependent on price cost reduction service and quality in north america three steel suppliers provide nearly 65 percent of our tinplate steel we believe we have limited our exposure related to changes in the costs of steel tinplate and aluminum as a result of the inclusion of provisions in many sales contracts to pass through steel and aluminum cost changes and the existence of certain other steel container sales contracts that incorporate annually negotiated metal costs in 2012 we were able to pass through the majority of steel cost increases levied by producers 

  

cost containment is crucial to maintaining profitability in the food and aerosol container manufacturing industries and ball is focused on doing so toward that end in the second quarter of 2011 ball closed its metal food container manufacturing facility in richmond british columbia 

  

in february 2013 ball announced the closure of its metal food and aerosol container manufacturing facility in elgin illinois the facility which produces aerosol and specialty steel cans as well as flat steel sheet used by other ball food and household products packaging facilities will cease production in the fourth quarter of 2013 and its production capacity will be consolidated into other ball facilities in connection with the closure the company will record an estimated aftertax charge of approximately 21 million for employee severance pension and other employee benefits costs the write down to net realizable value of certain fixed assets and other closure costs 

  

  

aerospace and technologies segment 

  

ball’s aerospace and technologies segment which accounted for 10 percent of consolidated net sales in 2012 includes national defense hardware antenna and video component technologies civil and operational space hardware and systems engineering services the segment develops spacecraft sensors and instruments radio frequency systems and other advanced technologies for the civil commercial and national security aerospace markets the majority of the aerospace and technologies business involves work under contracts generally from one to five years in duration as a prime contractor or subcontractor for the us department of defense dod the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and other us government agencies the company competes against both large and small prime contractors and subcontractors for these contracts contracts funded by the various agencies of the federal government represented 90 percent of segment sales in 2012 

  

intense competition and long operating cycles are key characteristics of both the company’s business and the aerospace and defense industry it is common in the aerospace and defense industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to another competitor become a subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting company it is not unusual to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or a customer of that same competitor on other contracts or vice versa 

  

geopolitical events and shifting executive and legislative branch priorities have resulted in an increase in opportunities over the past decade in areas matching our aerospace and technologies segment’s core capabilities in space hardware the businesses include hardware software and services sold primarily to us customers with emphasis on space science and exploration environmental and earth sciences and defense and intelligence applications major activities frequently involve the design manufacture and testing of satellites remote sensors and ground station control hardware and software as well as related services such as launch vehicle integration and satellite operations uncertainties in the federal government budgeting process could delay the funding or even result in cancellation of certain programs currently in our reported backlog 

  

other hardware activities include target identification warning and attitude control systems and components cryogenic systems for reactant storage and associated sensor cooling devices star trackers which are generalpurpose stellar attitude sensors and faststeering mirrors additionally the aerospace and technologies segment provides diversified technical services and products to government agencies prime contractors and commercial organizations for a broad range of information warfare electronic warfare avionics intelligence training and space systems needs 

  

backlog in the aerospace and technologies segment was 10 billion and 897 million at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively and consisted of the aggregate contract value of firm orders excluding amounts previously recognized as revenue the 2012 backlog includes 601 million expected to be recognized in revenues during 2013 with the remainder expected to be recognized in revenues thereafter unfunded amounts included in backlog for certain firm government orders which are subject to annual funding were 573 million and 470 million at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively yearoveryear comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations due to the nature of varying delivery and milestone schedules on contracts and funding of programs 

  

discontinued operations — plastic packaging americas 

  

in august 2010 we completed the sale of our plastics packaging americas business to amcor limited and received gross proceeds of 2587 million this amount included 15 million of contingent consideration recognized at closing and was net of postclosing adjustments of 213 million the sale of our plastics packaging business included five us facilities that manufactured pet bottles and preforms and polypropylene bottles as well as associated customer contracts and other related assets and liabilities 

  

patents 

  

in the opinion of the company’s management none of our active patents or groups of patents is material to the successful operation of our business as a whole we manage our intellectual property portfolio to obtain the durations necessary to achieve our business objectives 

  

  

research and development 

  

research and development rd efforts in our packaging segments are primarily directed toward packaging innovation specifically the development of new features sizes shapes and types of containers as well as new uses for existing containers other additional rd efforts in these segments seek to improve manufacturing efficiencies and the overall sustainability of our products our packaging rd activities are primarily conducted in the ball technology  innovation center btic located in westminster colorado and in a technical center located in bonn germany 

  

in our aerospace business we continue to focus our rd activities on the design development and manufacture of innovative aerospace products and systems this includes the production of spacecraft instruments and sensors radio frequency and system components data exploitation solutions and a variety of advanced aerospace technologies and products that enable deep space missions our aerospace rd activities are conducted at various locations in the us 

  

additional information regarding company rd activity is contained in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report as well as in item 2 “properties” 

  

sustainability and the environment 

  

sustainability is a key part of maximizing value at ball in our global operations we focus our sustainability efforts on employee safety and reducing energy water waste and air emissions in addition to those operational priorities we identified innovation recycling talent management supply chain management and community involvement as priorities for our corporate sustainability efforts by continuously working toward reducing the environmental impacts of our products throughout their life cycle we also improve our financial results information about our corporate management goals and performance data are available at wwwballcomsustainability 

  

the biggest opportunity to further minimize the environmental impacts of metal packaging is to increase recycling rates aluminum and steel are infinitely recyclable materials and metal packaging is already the most recycled packaging in the world by using recycled material for the production of aluminum and steel up to 95 percent of the energy used for the production of virgin material can be saved in some of ball’s markets such as brazil china and several european countries recycling rates for beverage containers are in excess of 90 percent recycling rates vary throughout europe but average around 67 percent for aluminum beverage containers and 71 percent for steel containers the 2011 recycling rate in the us for aluminum beverage containers was 65 percent the 2011 us recycling rate for steel containers was 71 percent 

  

in several of ball’s markets we help establish and financially support recycling initiatives educating consumers about the benefits of recycling aluminum and steel containers and collaborating with industry partners to create effective collection and recycling systems contribute to increased recycling rates for more details about programs we support please visit wwwballcomrecycling

 item 1a risk factors 

  

any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

our business operating results and financial condition are subject to particular risks in certain regions of the world 

  

we may experience an operating loss in one or more regions of the world for one or more periods which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition moreover overcapacity which often leads to lower prices exists in a number of the regions in which we operate and may persist even if demand grows our ability to manage such operational fluctuations and to maintain adequate longterm strategies in the face of such developments will be critical to our continued growth and profitability 

  

there can be no assurance that the company’s business acquisitions will be successfully integrated into the acquiring company see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report for details of acquisitions made during the three years ended december 31 2012 

  

while we have what we believe to be well designed integration plans if we cannot successfully integrate the acquired operations with those of ball we may experience material negative consequences to our business financial condition or results of operations the integration of companies that have previously been operated separately involves a number of risks including but not limited to 

  

·   demands on management related to the increase in our size after the acquisition 

·   the diversion of management’s attention from the management of existing operations to the integration of the acquired operations 

·   difficulties in the assimilation and retention of employees 

·   difficulties in the integration of departments systems including accounting systems technologies books and records and procedures as well as in maintaining uniform standards controls including internal accounting controls procedures and policies 

·   expenses related to any undisclosed or potential liabilities and 

·   retention of major customers and suppliers 

  

  

we may not be able to achieve potential synergies or maintain the levels of revenue earnings or operating efficiency that each business had achieved or might achieve separately the successful integration of the acquired operations will depend on our ability to manage those operations realize revenue opportunities and to some degree eliminate redundant and excess costs 

  

the loss of a key customer or a reduction in its requirements could have a significant negative impact on our sales 

  

we sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major beverage packaged food personal care and household product companies some of which operate in north america south america europe and asia 

  

although the majority of our customer contracts are longterm these contracts are terminable under certain circumstances such as our failure to meet quality volume or market pricing requirements because we depend on relatively few major customers our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss of any of these customers a reduction in the purchasing levels of these customers a strike or work stoppage by a significant number of these customers’ employees or an adverse change in the terms of the supply agreements with these customers 

  

the primary customers for our aerospace segment are us government agencies or their prime contractors our contracts with these customers are subject to several risks including funding cuts and delays technical uncertainties budget changes competitive activity and changes in scope 

  

we face competitive risks from many sources that may negatively impact our profitability 

  

competition within the packaging and aerospace industries is intense increases in productivity combined with existing or potential surplus capacity in the industry have maintained competitive pricing pressures the principal methods of competition in the general packaging industry are price innovation and sustainability service and quality in the aerospace industry they are technical capability cost and schedule some of our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources and some may currently have significant excess capacity our current or potential competitors may offer products at a lower price or products that are deemed superior to ours the global economic environment has resulted in reductions in demand for our products in some instances which in turn could increase these competitive pressures 

  

we are subject to competition from alternative products which could result in lower profits and reduced cash flows 

  

our metal packaging products are subject to significant competition from substitute products particularly plastic carbonated soft drink bottles made from pet single serve beer bottles and other food and beverage containers made of glass cardboard or other materials competition from plastic carbonated soft drink bottles is particularly intense in the us europe and the prc certain of our aerospace products are also subject to competition from alternative products and solutions there can be no assurance that our products will successfully compete against alternative products which could result in a reduction in our profits or cash flow 

  

our packaging businesses have a narrow product range and our business would suffer if usage of our products decreased 

  

for the year ended december 31 2012 74 percent of our consolidated net sales were from the sale of metal beverage containers and we expect to derive a significant portion of our future revenues and cash flows from the sale of metal beverage containers our business would suffer if the use of metal beverage containers decreased accordingly broad acceptance by consumers of aluminum and steel containers for a wide variety of beverages is critical to our future success if demand for glass and pet bottles increases relative to metal containers or the demand for aluminum and steel containers does not develop as expected our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

  

changes in laws and governmental regulations may adversely affect our business and operations 

  

we and our customers and suppliers are subject to various federal state and provincial laws and regulations which are increasing in number and complexity each of our and their facilities is subject to federal state provincial and local licensing and regulation by health environmental workplace safety and other agencies in multiple jurisdictions requirements of worldwide governmental authorities with respect to manufacturing manufacturing facility locations within the jurisdiction product content and safety climate change workplace safety and health environmental expropriation of assets and other standards could adversely affect our ability to manufacture or sell our products and the ability of our customers and suppliers to manufacture and sell their products in addition we face risks arising from compliance with and enforcement of increasingly numerous and complex federal state country and provincial laws and regulations 

  

  

enacted regulatory developments regarding the reporting and use of “conflict minerals” mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of certain of our products as a result there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflictfree materials and we cannot give assurance that we will be able to obtain such products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices also because our supply chain is complex we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of all materials used in the products that we sell the compliance and reporting aspects of these regulations may result in incremental costs to the company 

  

while deposit systems and other containerrelated legislation have been adopted in some jurisdictions similar legislation has been defeated in public referenda and legislative bodies in many others we anticipate that continuing efforts will be made to consider and adopt such legislation in the future the packages we produce are widely used and perform well in us states canadian provinces and european countries that have deposit systems as well as in other countries worldwide 

  

significant environmental employmentrelated and other legislation and regulatory requirements exist and are also evolving the compliance costs associated with current and proposed laws and potential regulations could be substantial and any failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws or regulations could lead to litigation or governmental action all of which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

  

our business financial condition and results of operations are subject to risks resulting from broader geographic operations 

  

we derived approximately 37 percent of our consolidated net sales from outside of the us for the year ended december 31 2012 the sizeable scope of operations outside of the us may lead to more volatile financial results and make it more difficult for us to manage our business reasons for this include but are not limited to the following 

  

·   political and economic instability 

·   governments’ restrictive trade policies 

·   the imposition of duties taxes or government royalties 

·   exchange rate risks 

·   difficulties in enforcement of contractual obligations and intellectual property rights and 

·   the geographic language and cultural differences between personnel in different areas of the world 

  

any of these factors many of which are also present in the us could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

we are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations 

  

our reporting currency is the us dollar a portion of ball’s operations including assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses have been denominated in various currencies other than the us dollar and we expect such operations will continue to be so denominated as a result the us dollar value of these operations has varied and will continue to vary with exchange rate fluctuations ball has been and is presently primarily exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate of the euro british pound canadian dollar polish zloty chinese yuan brazilian real and other currencies 

  

a decrease in the value of any of these currencies compared to the us dollar could reduce our profits from these operations and the value of their net assets when reported in us dollars in our financial statements this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations as reported in us dollars in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to currencies in which the earnings are generated may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations 

  

we manage our exposure to currency fluctuations particularly our exposure to fluctuations in the euro to us dollar exchange rate in order to attempt to mitigate the effect of cash flow and earnings volatility associated with exchange rate changes we primarily use forward contracts and options to manage our currency exposures and as a result we experience gains and losses on these derivative positions offset in part by the impact of currency fluctuations on existing assets and liabilities our inability to properly manage our exposure to currency fluctuations could materially impact our results 

  

  

if we fail to retain key management and personnel we may be unable to implement our key objectives 

  

we believe that our future success depends in part on our experienced management team unforeseen losses of key members of our management team without appropriate succession andor compensation planning could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet our objectives 

  

decreases in our ability to apply new technology and knowhow may affect our competitiveness 

  

our success depends partially on our ability to improve production processes and services we must also introduce new products and services to meet changing customer needs if we are unable to implement better production processes or to develop new products through research and development or licensing of new technology we may not be able to remain competitive with other manufacturers as a result our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

adverse weather and climate changes may result in lower sales 

  

we manufacture packaging products primarily for beverages and foods unseasonably cool weather can reduce demand for certain beverages packaged in our containers in addition poor weather conditions or changes in climate that reduce crop yields of fruits and vegetables can adversely affect demand for our food containers climate change could have various effects on the demand for our products in different regions around the world 

  

we are vulnerable to fluctuations in the supply and price of raw materials 

  

we purchase aluminum steel and other raw materials and packaging supplies from several sources while all such materials are available from independent suppliers raw materials are subject to fluctuations in price and availability attributable to a number of factors including general economic conditions commodity price fluctuations particularly aluminum on the london metal exchange the demand by other industries for the same raw materials and the availability of complementary and substitute materials although we enter into commodities purchase agreements from time to time and sometimes use derivative instruments to seek to manage our risk we cannot ensure that our current suppliers of raw materials will be able to supply us with sufficient quantities at reasonable prices economic and financial factors could impact our suppliers thereby causing supply shortages increases in raw material costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in the americas europe and asia some contracts do not allow us to pass along increased raw material costs and we generally use derivative agreements to seek to manage this risk our hedging procedures may be insufficient and our results could be materially impacted if costs of materials increase due to the fixed price contracts and derivative activities while increasing raw material costs may not impact our nearterm profitability increased prices could decrease our sales volume over time 

  

prolonged work stoppages at facilities with union employees could jeopardize our financial position 

  

as of december 31 2012 approximately 46 percent of our north american packaging facility employees and approximately 75 percent of our european packaging plant employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements these collective bargaining agreements have staggered expirations during the next several years although we consider our employee relations to be generally good a prolonged work stoppage or strike at any facility with union employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition we cannot ensure that upon the expiration of existing collective bargaining agreements new agreements will be reached without union action or that any such new agreements will be on terms satisfactory to us 

  

our aerospace and technologies segment is subject to certain risks specific to that business 

  

in our aerospace business us government contracts are subject to reduction or modification in the event of changes in requirements and the government may also terminate contracts at its convenience pursuant to standard termination provisions in such instances ball may be entitled to reimbursement for allowable cost and profits on authorized work that has been performed through the date of termination 

  

in addition budgetary constraints may result in further reductions to projected spending levels by the us government in particular government expenditures are subject to the potential for automatic reductions generally referred to as “sequestration” sequestration may occur during 2013 resulting in significant additional reductions to spending by various us government defense and aerospace agencies on both existing and new contracts as well as the disruption of ongoing programs even if sequestration does not occur we expect that budgetary constraints and ongoing concerns regarding the us national debt will continue to place downward pressure on agency spending levels due to these and other factors overall spending on various programs could decline which could result in significant reductions to revenue cash flows net earnings and backlog primarily in our aerospace and technologies segment 

  

  

we use estimates in accounting for many of our programs in our aerospace business and changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results 

  

we account for sales and profits on some longterm contracts in our aerospace business in accordance with the percentageofcompletion method of accounting using the cumulative catchup method to account for updates in estimates the percentageofcompletion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project revenues and costs at completion and various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events including the quantity and timing of product deliveries future labor performance and rates and material and overhead costs these assumptions involve various levels of expected performance improvements under the cumulative catchup method the impact of updates in our estimates related to units shipped to date is recognized immediately 

  

because of the significance of the judgments and estimates described above it is likely that we could record materially different amounts if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances or estimates were to change accordingly updates in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates may materially affect our future financial performance 

  

our backlog includes both costtype and fixedprice contracts costtype contracts generally have lower profit margins than fixedprice contracts our earnings and margins may vary depending on the types of government contracts undertaken the nature of the work performed under those contracts the costs incurred in performing the work the achievement of other performance objectives and their impact on our ability to receive fees 

  

as a us government contractor we could be adversely affected by changes in regulations or any negative findings from a us government audit or investigation 

  

we operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its agencies such as the defense contract audit agency dcaa and defense contract management agency dcma these agencies review performance under our contracts our cost structure and our compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies systems that are subject to review under the new dod federal acquisition regulation supplement dfars effective may 18 2011 are accounting and billing systems purchasing systems estimating systems material management and accounting systems and earned value management systems any costs ultimately found to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if already reimbursed if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties sanctions or suspension or debarment from doing business with the us government whether or not illegal activities are alleged the us government also has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate if such actions were to result in suspension or debarment this could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

our business is subject to substantial environmental remediation and compliance costs 

  

our operations are subject to federal state provincial and local laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions relating to environmental hazards such as emissions to air discharges to water the handling and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes and the cleanup of hazardous substances we have been designated along with numerous other companies as a potentially responsible party for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites based on available information we do not believe that any costs incurred in connection with such sites will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations capital expenditures or competitive position there is increased focus on the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental issues worldwide 

  

our business faces the potential of increased regulation on some of the raw materials utilized in our packaging operations 

  

our operations are subject to federal state provincial and local laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions relating to some of the raw materials such as epoxybased coatings utilized in our container making process epoxybased coatings may contain bisphenola bpa scientific evidence evaluated by regulatory agencies in the united states canada europe japan australia and new zealand has consistently shown these coatings to be safe for food contact at current levels and these regulatory agencies have stated that human exposure to bpa from epoxybased container coatings is well below safe exposure limits set by government bodies worldwide a significant change in these regulatory agency statements or other adverse information concerning bpa could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations ball recognizes that significant interest exists in non epoxybased coatings and we have been proactively working with coatings suppliers and our customers to evaluate alternatives to current coatings 

  

  

net earnings and net worth could be materially affected by an impairment of goodwill 

  

we have a significant amount of goodwill recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2012 we are required at least annually to test the recoverability of goodwill the recoverability test of goodwill is based on the current fair value of our identified reporting units fair value measurement requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors including revenue and market growth operating cash flows and discount rates if general market conditions deteriorate in portions of our business we could experience a significant decline in the fair value of reporting units this decline could lead to an impairment of all or a significant portion of the goodwill balance which could materially affect our us gaap net earnings and net worth 

  

if the investments in ball’s pension plans or in the multiemployer pension plans in which ball participates do not perform as expected we may have to contribute additional amounts to the plans which would otherwise be available to cover operating expenses and fund growth opportunities 

  

ball maintains defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of its north american and united kingdom employees which are funded based on certain actuarial assumptions the plans’ assets consist primarily of common stocks fixed income securities and in the us alternative investments market declines longevity increases or legislative changes such as the pension protection act in the us could result in a prospective decrease in our available cash flow and net earnings over time and the recognition of an increase in our pension obligations could result in a reduction to our shareholders’ equity additional risks exist related to the company’s participation in multiemployer pension plans assets contributed to a multiemployer pension plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers if a participating employer in a multiemployer pension plan stops contributing to the plan the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participants this could result in increases to our contributions to the plans as well as pension expense 

  

restricted access to capital markets could adversely affect our shortterm liquidity and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the notes issued pursuant to our bond indentures 

  

on december 31 2012 we had total debt of 33 billion and unused committed credit lines of approximately 773 million a reduction in global market liquidity could 

  

·   restrict our ability to fund working capital capital expenditures research and development expenditures and other business activities 

·   increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions including the credit risks stemming from the economic environment 

·   limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate 

·   restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities and 

·   limit along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt among other things our ability to borrow additional funds dispose of assets pay cash dividends or refinance debt maturities 

  

in addition approximately onefourth of our debt bears interest at variable rates if market interest rates increase variablerate debt will create higher debt service requirements which would adversely affect our cash flow while we sometimes enter into agreements limiting our exposure any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk 

  

the global credit financial and economic environment could have a negative impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

the overall credit financial and economic environment could have significant negative effects on our operations including the following 

  

·   the creditworthiness of customers suppliers and counterparties could deteriorate resulting in a financial loss or a disruption in our supply of raw materials 

·   volatile market performance could affect the fair value of our pension assets potentially requiring us to make significant additional contributions to our defined benefit plans to maintain prescribed funding levels 

·   a significant weakening of our financial position or operating results could result in noncompliance with our debt covenants and 

·   reduced cash flow from our operations could adversely affect our ability to execute our longterm strategy to increase liquidity reduce debt repurchase our stock and invest in our businesses 

  

  

changes in us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap and securities and exchange commission sec rules and regulations could materially impact our reported results 

  

us gaap and sec accounting and reporting changes are common and have become more frequent and significant over the past several years furthermore the us and international accounting standard setters are in the process of jointly converging several key accounting standards these changes could have significant effects on our reported results when compared to prior periods and other companies and may even require us to retrospectively adjust prior periods additionally material changes to the presentation of transactions in the consolidated financial statements could impact key ratios that analysts and credit rating agencies use to rate ball and ultimately our ability to access the credit markets in an efficient manner 

  

increased information technology it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems networks products solutions and services 

  

increased global it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including employee training comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems networks products solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats depending on their nature and scope such threats could potentially lead to the compromise of confidential information improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which in turn could adversely affect our reputation competitiveness and results of operations

management’s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k which include additional information about our accounting policies practices and the transactions underlying our financial results the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes including various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits taxes environmental and other matters arising during the normal course of business we apply our best judgment our knowledge of existing facts and circumstances and actions that we may undertake in the future in determining the estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances such as current economic conditions and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change as future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision actual results may differ from these estimates ball corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as “ball corporation” “ball” “the company” or “we” or “our” in the following discussion and analysis 

  

overview 

  

business overview and industry trends 

  

ball corporation is one of the world’s leading suppliers of metal packaging to the beverage food personal care and household products industries our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses are manufactured in facilities around the world and are competitive with other substrates such as plastics and glass in the rigid packaging industry sales and earnings can be increased by reducing costs increasing prices developing new products expanding volumes and making strategic acquisitions we also provide aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers 

  

we sell our packaging products mainly to large multinational beverage food personal care and household products companies with which we have developed longterm customer relationships this is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of longterm supply contracts while we have a diversified customer base we sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major companies in north america europe the prc and south america as do our equity joint ventures in the us and vietnam the overall metal beverage and aerosol container industries are growing globally and are expected to continue to grow in the medium to long term despite the north american market seeing a continued slight decline the primary customers for the products and services provided by our aerospace and technologies segment are us government agencies or their prime contractors 

  

we purchase our raw materials from relatively few suppliers we also have exposure to inflation in particular the rising costs of raw materials as well as other direct cost inputs we mitigate our exposure to the changes in the costs of metal through the inclusion of provisions in a majority of our packaging sales contracts to pass through metal price changes as well as through the use of derivative instruments the passthrough provisions generally result in proportional increases or decreases in sales and costs with a greatly reduced impact if any on net earnings because of our customer and supplier concentration our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss insolvency or bankruptcy of a major customer or supplier or a change in a supply agreement with a major customer or supplier although our contract provisions generally mitigate the risk of customer loss and our longterm relationships represent a known stable customer base 

  

we recognize sales under longterm contracts in the aerospace and technologies segment using percentageofcompletion under the costtocost method of accounting throughout the period of contract performance we regularly reevaluate and if necessary revise our estimates of aerospace and technologies total contract revenue total contract cost and progress toward completion because of contract payment schedules limitations on funding and other contract terms our sales and accounts receivable for this segment include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed 

  

the aerospace and technologies contract mix in 2012 consisted of approximately 60 percent costtype contracts which are billed at our costs plus an agreed upon andor earned profit component and 34 percent fixedprice contracts the remainder represents time and material contracts which typically provide for the sale of labor at fixed hourly rates the contracted backlog of approximately 10 billion at december 31 2012 consisted of approximately 38 percent fixed price contracts 

  

  

corporate strategy 

  

our drive for 10 vision encompasses five strategic levers that are key to growing our business and achieving longterm success during 2012 and 2011 we made progress on each of our drive for 10 levers as described in the following 

  

·   maximizing value in our existing businesses through reducing standard beverage container and end capacity in north america and the expansion of specialty container production to meet current demand redeployment of surplus equipment to other global locations closure of certain metal beverage facilities and relocating our european headquarters to zurich switzerland to gain business customer and supplier efficiencies 

  

·   expanding into new products and capabilities through expansion into extruded aluminum aerosol manufacturing with the acquisitions of envases in december 2012 and aerocan in january 2011 

  

·   aligning ourselves with the right customers and markets by investing capital to meet doubledigit volume growth for specialty beverage containers throughout the global network 

  

·   broadening our geographic reach with the construction and start up of three beverage container manufacturing facilities in china brazil and vietnam and 

  

·   leveraging our technological expertise in packaging innovation and aerospace technologies to maintain our competitive advantage today and in the future the backlog in our aerospace business increased 14 percent during 2012 to 10 billion 

  

these ongoing business developments help us stay close to our customers while expanding andor sustaining our industry positions with major beverage food personal care household products and aerospace customers 

  

  

results of operations 

  

consolidated sales and earnings 

  

   

the increase in net sales in 2012 compared to 2011 was driven largely by higher sales in aerospace and higher beverage container sales volumes in certain geographical regions being offset by lower sales volumes in food and household containers and unfavorable currency translation effects in europe earnings were favorably impacted by higher sales volumes in certain geographical regions improved pricing and product sales mix and continued yearoveryear improvement in our manufacturing costs while negatively impacted by higher distribution and warehousing costs and new facility start up costs in other markets in addition to the business segment performance analyzed below net earnings attributable to ball corporation included discontinued operations higher business consolidation and debt refinancing costs a decrease in equity earnings and a lower tax rate in 2012 these items are detailed in the “management performance measures” section below 

  

the increase in net sales in 2011 compared to 2010 was driven largely by the increase in demand for metal packaging in the prc improved beverage container volumes in the americas the consolidation of latapackball the acquisitions of two prc joint ventures and the extruded aluminum businesses and improved aerospace program performance 

  

cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization 

  

cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization was 71740 million in 2012 compared to 70812 million in 2011 and 62541 million in 2010 these amounts represented 821 percent 820 percent and 820 percent of consolidated net sales for those three years respectively 

  

depreciation and amortization 

  

depreciation and amortization expense was 2829 million in 2012 compared to 3011 million in 2011 and 2655 million in 2010 these amounts represented 32 percent 35 percent and 35 percent of consolidated net sales for those three years respectively the lower depreciation and amortization expense in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to the revision of estimated useful lives of certain capital equipment and tooling further details of the revised estimated lives are available in note 1 accompanying the consolidated financial statements included within item 8 of this report the higher depreciation and amortization expense in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to acquisitions capital spending in existing businesses in excess of historical levels and changes in currency exchange rates 

  

selling general and administrative 

  

selling general and administrative sga expenses were 3855 million in 2012 compared to 3814 million in 2011 and 3568 million in 2010 these amounts represented 44 percent 44 percent and 47 percent of consolidated net sales for those three years respectively there were no individually significant items affecting 2012 compared to 2011 the increase in sga in 2011 compared to 2010 was due to unfavorable currency exchange effects the consolidation of our acquisitions and other individually insignificant higher costs 

  

  

interest expense 

  

consolidated interest expense was 1949 million in 2012 compared to 1771 million in 2011 and 1582 million in 2010 interest expense in 2012 included 151 million for the call premium and the write off of unamortized financing costs and issuance premiums related to the tender of ball’s 6625 percent senior notes due march 2018 interest expense in 2012 compared to 2011 excluding debt refinancing costs was slightly higher due to higher levels of debt including the issuance of 750 million of senior notes in march 2012 partially offset by lower interest rates 

  

the higher interest expense in 2011 compared to 2010 excluding debt refinancing costs was due to higher levels of debt related to the acquisitions of aerocan jfp and neuman aluminum neuman the consolidation of latapackball and higher share repurchases as well as the refinancing of the company’s bank credit facilities in december 2010 interest expense as a percentage of average monthly borrowings was 55 percent in 2012 54 percent in 2011 and 53 percent in 2010 

  

tax provision 

  

the effective income tax rate for earnings from continuing operations was 277 percent in 2012 compared to 305 percent in 2011 and 290 percent in 2010 the lower rate in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily the net result of the release of various income tax reserves effectively settled with taxing jurisdictions a lower income tax rate on foreign earnings and an increased tax benefit on company and trustowned life insurance the higher rate in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to significant discrete period tax benefits in 2010 not recurring in 2011 related to a change in entity status of a foreign subsidiary and the 2010 worldwide debt refinancing these two items were partially offset by a lower 2011 effective income tax rate on foreign earnings primarily related to the inclusion of a full year of brazil’s results and the acquisition of aerocan both of which have income tax holidays 

  

equity in results of affiliates 

  

in october 2011 we acquired our partners’ 60 percent equity interests in qmcp and recorded a gain of 92 million on the fair value of our previously held equity ownership as a result of the required purchased accounting additionally in march 2011 we entered into a joint venture agreement with thai beverage can limited to construct a beverage container manufacturing facility in vietnam that began production in the first quarter of 2012 

  

in august 2010 we acquired an additional 101 percent economic interest in our brazilian beverage packaging joint venture latapackball increasing our overall economic ownership interest in the joint venture to 601 percent in connection with the acquisition of the additional interest in latapackball we recorded a gain of 818 million on the fair value of the previously held 50 percent equity ownership as a result of the required purchase accounting 

  

in june 2010 we acquired our partner’s 65 percent interest in jfp and entered into a longterm supply agreement in connection with the acquisition we recorded equity earnings of 241 million which was composed of equity earnings gains on the forgiveness of debt and guarantees and a gain realized on the fair value of ball’s equity investment as a result of the required purchase accounting

segment earnings in 2012 decreased 26 million compared to 2011 primarily due to nonrecurring inventory holding gains in 2011 of 16 million and lower 2012 sales volumes partially offset by favorable manufacturing performance and improved pricing and product mix 

  

segment earnings in 2011 increased 46 million compared to 2010 mainly due to the year over year impact of lower cost inventory of 16 million in 2011 contribution from a full year of aluminum slug sales and improved pricing and sales mix partially offset by lower sales volumes of 16 million and unfavorable manufacturing performance due to higher fourth quarter 2011 production curtailments

a   further details of these items are included in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

  

the aerospace and technologies segment consists of the manufacture and sale of aerospace and other related products and services provided for the defense civil space and commercial space industries 

  

segment sales in 2012 increased 922 million compared to 2011 primarily due to higher sales from us national defense contracts segment earnings in 2012 compared to 2011 increased 70 million as a result of continued strong program performance and higher sales

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

  

cash flows and capital expenditures 

  

our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities and external committed borrowings we believe that cash flows from operations and cash provided by shortterm and committed revolver borrowings when necessary will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements scheduled principal and interest payments on debt dividend payments and anticipated capital expenditures the following summarizes our cash flows 

  

   

lower operating cash flows in 2012 compared to 2011 were primarily due to approximately 90 million higher us pension funding working capital changes in 2012 were primarily related to higher days payable outstanding and more effective inventory management partially offset by higher days sales outstanding days payable outstanding increased from 42 days to 47 days inventory days on hand decreased from 53 days to 51 days and days sales outstanding increased from 36 days to 37 days 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2012 the company entered into an accounts receivable factoring program with a financial institution for certain receivables of the company the program is considered a true sale of the receivables and has a limit of 90 million of which 75 million was sold as of december 31 2012 

  

cash flows provided by operating activities in 2010 included a working capital outflow of 250 million related to a change in accounting for our accounts receivable securitization program which was effective january 1 2010 higher operating cash flows in 2011 compared to 2010 excluding the accounting change were due primarily to higher earnings before interest and taxes favorable working capital changes the consolidation of latapackball and lower pension funding the favorable working capital changes in 2011 were primarily related to lower days sales outstanding higher days payable outstanding and more effective inventory management days sales outstanding decreased from 38 days to 36 days days payable outstanding increased from 39 days to 42 days and inventory days on hand decreased from 61 days to 53 days 

  

annual cash dividends paid on common stock were 40 cents per share in 2012 28 cents per share in 2011 and 20 cents per share in 2010 total dividends paid were 618 million in 2012 457 million in 2011 and 358 million in 2010 on january 30 2013 the company’s board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend to 13 cents per share beginning with the march 15 2013 payment date 

  

share repurchases 

  

the company’s share repurchases net of issuances totaled 4941 million in 2012 4739 million in 2011 and 5067 million in 2010 the repurchases were completed using cash on hand and available borrowings and included accelerated share repurchase agreements and other purchases under our ongoing share repurchase program additional details about our share repurchase activities are provided in note 15 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

  

  

debt facilities and refinancing 

  

the senior credit facilities bear interest at variable rates and include a 125 million term a loan denominated in us dollars a £465 million term b loan denominated in british sterling and a €913 million term c loan denominated in euros the facilities also include a longterm multicurrency committed revolving credit facility that provides the company with up to the us dollar equivalent of 1 billion 

  

total interestbearing debt of 33 billion at december 31 2012 was slightly higher than the amount outstanding at december 31 2011 of 31 billion 

  

on march 9 2012 ball issued 750 million of 500 percent senior notes due in march 2022 on the same date the company tendered for the redemption of its 6625 percent senior notes originally due in march 2018 in the amount of 450 million at a redemption price per note of 102583 percent of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest the company redeemed 3927 million during the first quarter of 2012 and the remaining 573 million was redeemed during the second quarter the redemption of the bonds resulted in a charge of 151 million for the call premium and the write off of unamortized financing costs and premiums the charge is included as a component of interest expense in the consolidated statement of earnings 

  

in november 2010 ball issued 500 million of new 575 percent senior notes due in may 2021 and in march 2010 ball issued 500 million of new 675 percent senior notes due in september 2020 on april 21 2010 the company redeemed 509 million of 6875 percent senior notes due december 2012 at a redemption price of 101146 percent of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest the redemption resulted in a charge of 81 million for the call premium and the write off of unamortized financing costs and unamortized premiums an additional 07 million of charges were recorded in connection with the refinancing of the company’s senior credit facilities in 2010 the charges are included as a component of interest expense in the consolidated statement of earnings 

  

in august 2011 the company entered into an accounts receivable securitization agreement for a term of three years which was amended in september 2012 the maximum the company can borrow under this agreement may vary between 110 million and 235 million depending on the seasonal accounts receivable balances in the company’s north american packaging businesses prior to the amendment the maximum borrowings could vary between 150 million and 275 million at december 31 2012 there were no outstanding amounts under the securitization agreement there were no accounts receivable sold at december 31 2012 at december 31 2011 2310 million of accounts receivable were sold under this agreement borrowings under the securitization agreement are included within the shortterm debt and current portion of longterm debt line on the balance sheet 

  

at december 31 2012 taking into account outstanding letters of credit approximately 773 million was available under the company’s committed multicurrency revolving credit facilities in addition to these longterm committed credit facilities the company had approximately 614 million of shortterm uncommitted credit facilities available at the end of 2012 of which 1157 million was outstanding and due on demand 

  

given our free cash flow projections and unused credit facilities that are available until december 2015 our liquidity is strong and is expected to meet our ongoing cash and debt service requirements while ongoing financial and economic conditions raise concerns about credit risk with counterparties to derivative transactions the company mitigates its exposure by spreading the risk among various counterparties and limiting exposure to any one party we also monitor the credit ratings of our suppliers customers lenders and counterparties on a regular basis 

  

we were in compliance with all loan agreements at december 31 2012 and all prior years presented and have met all debt payment obligations the us note agreements and bank credit agreement contain certain restrictions relating to dividends investments financial ratios guarantees and the incurrence of additional indebtedness additional details about our debt and receivables sales agreements are available in note 12 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

  

  

other liquidity measures 

  

management performance measures 

  

management internally uses various measures to evaluate company performance such as return on average invested capital net operating earnings after tax over the relevant performance period divided by average invested capital over the same period economic value added eva® dollars net operating earnings after tax less a capital charge on average invested capital employed earnings before interest and taxes ebit earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda diluted earnings per share cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow generally defined by the company as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures we believe this information is also useful to investors as it provides insight into the earnings and cash flow criteria management uses to make strategic decisions these financial measures may be adjusted at times for items that affect comparability between periods such as business consolidation costs and gains or losses on acquisitions and dispositions outlined in the following calculations below 

  

the following financial measurements are on a nonus gaap basis and should be considered in connection with the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report nonus gaap measures should not be considered in isolation and should not be considered superior to or a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with us gaap a presentation of earnings in accordance with us gaap is available in item 8 of this annual report 

  

based on the above definitions our calculation of comparable ebit is summarized below 

  

   

our calculations of comparable ebitda the comparable ebit to interest coverage ratio and the net debt to comparable ebitda ratio are summarized below 

  

   

  

our calculation of comparable net earnings is summarized below 

  

   

free cash flow 

  

management internally uses a free cash flow measure 1 to evaluate the company’s operating results 2 to evaluate strategic investments 3 to plan stock buyback and dividend levels and 4 to evaluate the company’s ability to incur and service debt free cash flow is not a defined term under us gaap and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures the company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures free cash flow is typically derived directly from the company’s consolidated statement of cash flows however it may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods 

  

based on the above definition our consolidated free cash flow is summarized as follows 

  

   

based on information currently available we estimate cash flows from operating activities for 2013 to be in the range of 850 million capital expenditures to be approximately 400 million and free cash flow to be in the range of 450 million in 2013 we intend to utilize our operating cash flow to fund our stock repurchases dividend payments growth capital projects and to the extent available acquisitions that meet our various criteria of the total 2013 estimated capital expenditures approximately 188 million was contractually committed as of december 31 2012 

  

  

commitments 

  

cash payments required for longterm debt maturities rental payments under noncancellable operating leases purchase obligations and other commitments in effect at december 31 2012 are summarized in the following table 

  

   

a   amounts reported in local currencies have been translated at yearend 2012 exchange rates 

b   for variable rate facilities amounts are based on interest rates in effect at year end and do not contemplate the effects of any hedging instruments utilized by the company 

c   the company’s purchase obligations include contracted amounts for aluminum steel and other direct materials also included are commitments for purchases of natural gas and electricity expenses related to aerospace and technologies contracts and other less significant items in cases where variable prices andor usage are involved management’s best estimates have been used depending on the circumstances early termination of the contracts may or may not result in penalties and therefore actual payments could vary significantly 

  

the table above does not include 870 million of uncertain tax positions the timing of which is unknown at this time 

  

contributions to the company’s defined benefit pension plans not including the unfunded german plans are expected to be in the range of 95 million in 2013 of which approximately 80 million was contributed in january 2013 this estimate may change based on changes in the pension protection act and actual plan asset performance among other factors benefit payments related to these plans are expected to be 849 million 793 million 831 million 864 million and 906 million for the years ending december 31 2013 through 2017 respectively and a total of 5067 million for the years 2018 through 2022 payments to participants in the unfunded german plans are expected to be between 21 million €16 million and 23 million €17 million in each of the years 2013 through 2017 and a total of 99 million €75 million for the years 2018 through 2022 

  

for the us pension plans in 2013 we revised our return on asset assumption to 7625 percent from 775 percent in 2012 and our discount rate assumption to 4125 percent from 475 percent in 2012 based on these changes in assumptions and revisions based on plan experience studies us pension expense in 2013 is anticipated to be approximately 55 million higher than in 2012 a reduction of the expected return on pension assets assumption by one quarter of a percentage point would result in an estimated 32 million increase in the 2013 global pension expense while a quarter of a percentage point reduction in the discount rate applied to the pension liability would result in an estimated 55 million of additional pension expense in 2013 additional information regarding the company’s pension plans is provided in note 14 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

  

due to the us tax status of certain of ball’s subsidiaries in canada and the prc the company annually provides us taxes on foreign earnings in those subsidiaries net of any estimated foreign tax credits in 2010 ball increased its economic interest in its brazilian joint venture and due to the nature of the investment ball provides deferred taxes on the portion of undistributed earnings of the brazil investment related to this incremental investment net us taxes provided for brazil canada and prc earnings in 2012 2011 and 2010 were 187 million 177 million and 134 million respectively for the foreseeable future anticipated cash flow from the us operations should be sufficient to meet the domestic operational needs including capital expenditures dividends share repurchases and debt service including minimal near term debt maturities over the next few years should domestic cash flow gaps arise due to unforeseen events ball can access funds in the us to bridge those gaps from its committed revolving credit facility from public bond markets from cash deposits in the prc on earnings for which us taxes have been provided and from repayment of outstanding us loans to foreign subsidiaries consequently management’s intention is to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of ball’s remaining foreign investments and as a result no us income or federal withholding tax provision has been made it is not practical to estimate the additional taxes that may become payable upon the eventual remittance of these foreign earnings however repatriation of these earnings would result in a relatively high incremental tax rate

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

financial instruments and risk management 

  

the company employs established risk management policies and procedures which seek to reduce the company’s exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices interest rates currency exchange rates and prices of the company’s common stock with regard to common share repurchases and the company’s deferred compensation stock plan however there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be successful although the instruments utilized involve varying degrees of credit market and interest risk the counterparties to the agreements are expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements the company monitors counterparty credit risk including lenders on a regular basis but ball cannot be certain that all risks will be discerned or that its risk management policies and procedures will always be effective further details are available in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

  

we have estimated our market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis market risk exposure has been defined as the changes in fair value of derivative instruments financial instruments and commodity positions to test the sensitivity of our market risk exposure we have estimated the changes in fair value of market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in market prices or rates the results of the sensitivity analyses are summarized below 

  

commodity price risk 

  

aluminum 

  

we manage commodity price risk in connection with market price fluctuations of aluminum ingot through two different methods first we enter into container sales contracts that include aluminum ingotbased pricing terms that generally reflect the same price fluctuations included in commercial purchase contracts for aluminum sheet the terms include fixed floating or passthrough aluminum ingot component pricing second we use derivative instruments such as option and forward contracts as economic and cash flow hedges of commodity price risk where there is not an arrangement in the sales contract to match underlying purchase volumes and pricing with sales volumes and pricing 

  

steel 

  

most sales contracts involving our steel products either include provisions permitting us to pass through some or all steel cost changes incurred or they incorporate annually negotiated steel prices we anticipate at this time that we will be able to pass through the majority of any steel price changes that may occur in 2013 

  

considering the effects of derivative instruments the company’s ability to pass through certain raw material costs through contractual provisions the market’s ability to accept price increases and the company’s commodity price exposures under its contract terms a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the company’s steel and aluminum prices could result in an estimated 57 million aftertax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period additionally the company has currency exposures on raw materials and the effect of a 10 percent adverse change is included in the total currency exposure discussed below actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates 

  

the company is also exposed to fluctuations in prices for natural gas and electricity as well as the cost of diesel fuel as a component of freight cost a hypothetical 10 percent increase in our natural gas and electricity prices could result in an estimated 74 million aftertax reduction of net earnings over a oneyear period a hypothetical 10 percent increase in diesel fuel prices could result in an estimated 06 million aftertax reduction of net earnings over the same period actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates 

  

interest rate risk 

  

our objective in managing exposure to interest rate changes is to manage the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to minimize our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we may use a variety of interest rate swaps collars and options to manage our mix of floating and fixedrate debt interest rate instruments held by the company at december 31 2012 included payfixed interest rate swaps which effectively convert variable rate obligations to fixedrate instruments 

  

  

based on our interest rate exposure at december 31 2012 assumed floating rate debt levels throughout the next 12 months and the effects of derivative instruments a 100basis point increase in interest rates could result in an estimated 54 million aftertax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates and the timing of these changes 

  

currency exchange rate risk 

  

our objective in managing exposure to currency fluctuations is to limit the exposure of cash flows and earnings from changes associated with currency exchange rate changes through the use of various derivative contracts in addition at times ball manages earnings translation volatility through the use of currency option strategies and the change in the fair value of those options is recorded in the company’s net earnings our currency translation risk results from the currencies in which we transact business we face currency exposures in our global operations as a result of selling our products in local currency purchasing raw materials in us dollars and to a lesser extent in other currencies sales contracts are negotiated with customers to reflect cost changes and where there is not an exchange passthrough arrangement the company uses forward and option contracts to manage currency exposures 

  

considering the company’s derivative financial instruments outstanding at december 31 2012 currency exposures and currency exposures from the purchase and sale of raw materials a hypothetical 10 percent reduction us dollar strengthening in currency exchange rates compared to the us dollar could result in an estimated 321 million aftertax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period this hypothetical adverse change in currency exchange rates would also reduce our forecasted average debt balance by 306 million actual changes in market prices or rates may differ from hypothetical changes 

  

common stock price risk 

  

the company’s deferred compensation stock program is subject to variable plan accounting and accordingly is marked to fair value using the company’s closing stock price at the end of a reporting period based on current share levels in the program each 1 change in the company’s stock price has an impact of 16 million on pretax earnings during march and september 2011 the company entered into total return swaps to mitigate the company’s exposure to these fair value fluctuations which were renewed in january 2012 and july 2012 and will be outstanding until march 2013 and september 2013 respectively the swaps have a notional value of 1 million shares and 500000 shares respectively

we are headquartered in broomfield colorado us our stock is traded on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol bll 

  

our strategy 

  

our overall business strategy is defined by our drive for 10 vision which at its highest level is a mindset around perfection with a greater sense of urgency around our future success our drive for 10 vision encompasses five strategic levers that are key to growing our businesses and achieving longterm success these five levers are 

  

·   maximizing value in our existing businesses 

·   expanding into new products and capabilities 

·   aligning ourselves with the right customers and markets 

·   broadening our geographic reach and 

·   leveraging our knowhow and technological expertise to provide a competitive advantage 

  

we also maintain a clear and disciplined financial strategy focused on improving shareholder returns through 

  

·   delivering longterm earnings per share growth of 10 percent to 15 percent per annum 

·   focusing on free cash flow generation 

·   increasing economic value added eva® 

  

the cash generated by our businesses is used primarily 1 to finance the company’s operations 2 to fund stock buyback programs and dividend payments 3 to fund strategic capital investments and 4 to service the company’s debt we will when we believe it will benefit the company and our shareholders make strategic acquisitions enter into joint ventures or divest parts of our company the compensation of many of our employees is tied directly to the company’s performance through our eva® incentive programs 

  

  

our reporting segments 

  

ball corporation reports its financial performance in four reportable segments 1 metal beverage packaging americas and asia 2 metal beverage packaging europe 3 metal food and household products packaging americas and 4 aerospace and technologies ball also has investments in the us and vietnam which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and accordingly those results are not included in segment sales or earnings financial information related to each of our segments is included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report on form 10k annual report 

  

profitability is sensitive to selling prices production volumes labor transportation utility and warehousing costs as well as the availability and price of raw materials such as aluminum ingot and coils tinplate steel and other direct materials these raw materials are generally available from several sources and we have secured what we consider to be adequate supplies and are not experiencing any shortages there has been significant consolidation of raw material suppliers in both north america and europe over the past several years raw materials energy sources and other resources used in production may from time to time be in short supply or unavailable globally due to external factors we cannot predict the timing or effects if any of such occurrences on future operations 

  

metal beverage packaging americas and asia segment 

  

metal beverage packaging americas and asia is ball’s largest segment accounting for 51 percent of consolidated net sales in 2011 metal beverage containers are primarily sold under multiyear supply contracts to fillers of carbonated soft drinks beer energy drinks and other beverages 

  

americas 

  

metal beverage containers and ends are produced at 18 manufacturing facilities in the us one in canada and three in brazil can ends are produced within four of the us facilities including two facilities that manufacture only ends and one facility in brazil additionally rocky mountain metal container llc a 50percent investment owned by ball and millercoors llc operates metal beverage container and end manufacturing facilities in golden colorado 

  

where growth or contractions are projected in certain markets or for certain products ball undertakes selected capacity increases or decreases in its existing facilities and may establish additional manufacturing capacity to the extent required by the growth or decline of any of the markets we serve in january 2011 we announced plans to close our torrance california us facility relocate a line from the torrance facility to our whitby ontario canada facility and expand specialty can production in our fort worth texas us facility in february 2011 we announced plans to construct a new metal beverage container manufacturing facility in northeast brazil which is one of the fastest growing regions of the country the new facility will be located in alagoinhas bahia and is expected to begin production in early 2012 the output from the first line has been contracted under a longterm supply agreement in the second half of 2011 we reduced capacity in our columbus ohio us metal beverage container facility 

  

in august 2010 the company acquired an additional 101 percent economic interest in its brazilian metal beverage packaging joint venture latapackball embalagens ltda latapackball through a transaction with the joint venture partner latapack sa this transaction increased the company’s overall economic interest in the joint venture to 601 percent and resulted in ball becoming the primary beneficiary of the entity and consequently consolidating the joint venture 

  

according to publicly available information and company estimates the combined americas metal beverage container industry represents approximately 123 billion units five companies manufacture substantially all of the metal beverage containers in the us and canada and three companies manufacture substantially all such containers in brazil two of these producers and three other independent producers also manufacture metal beverage containers in mexico ball produced approximately 43 billion recyclable metal beverage containers in the americas in 2011 — about 35 percent of the aggregate production for those markets sales volumes of metal beverage containers in north america tend to be highest during the period from april through september while in brazil sales volumes tend to be highest from september through december all of the beverage cans produced by ball in the us canada and brazil are made of aluminum as are almost all beverage cans produced by our competitors in those countries in 2011 we were able to recover substantially all aluminumrelated cost increases levied by sheet producers through either financial or contractual means in the metal beverage packaging americas segment five aluminum suppliers provide virtually all of our requirements 

  

metal beverage containers are sold based on price quality service innovation and sustainability in a highly competitive market which is relatively capital intensive and is characterized by facilities that run more or less continuously in order to operate profitably in addition the metal beverage container competes aggressively with other packaging materials 

  

  

the glass bottle has maintained a meaningful position in the packaged beer industry while the pet container has grown significantly in the carbonated soft drink and water industries over the past quarter century 

  

we believe we have limited our exposure related to changes in the costs of aluminum ingot as a result of the inclusion of provisions in most metal beverage container sales contracts to pass through aluminum ingot price changes as well as through the use of derivative instruments 

  

asia 

  

the metal beverage container market in the prc is approximately 18 billion containers of which ball’s operations represented an estimated 28 percent in 2011 our percentage of the industry makes us one of the largest manufacturers of metal beverage containers in the prc and we plan to prudently add capacity where necessary to continue to supply this growing market eight other manufacturers account for the remainder of the production our operations include the manufacture of aluminum containers and ends in five facilities in the prc we also manufacture and sell highdensity plastic containers in two prc facilities primarily servicing the motor oil industry 

  

in october 2011 we acquired our partners’ 60 percent interest in qingdao mc packaging ltd qmcp a joint venture metal beverage container facility in qingdao prc the facility is being relocated and expanded in qingdao prc and is expected to begin production by the end of the first quarter of 2012 additionally in march 2011 we entered into a joint venture agreement with thai beverage can limited to construct a beverage container manufacturing facility in vietnam that will begin production in the first quarter of 2012 

  

in june 2010 we acquired guangdong jianlibao group co ltd’s 65 percent interest in a joint venture metal beverage container and end facility jfp in sanshui foshan prc ball had owned 35 percent of the joint venture facility since 1992 ball acquired the 65 percent interest for 869 million in cash net of cash acquired and assumed debt and also entered into a longterm beverage can supply agreement with jianlibao and one of its affiliates 

  

we believe we have limited our exposure related to changes in the costs of aluminum ingot as a result of the inclusion of provisions in most metal beverage container sales contracts to pass through aluminum ingot price changes as well as through the use of derivative instruments 

  

metal beverage packaging europe segment 

  

the european metal beverage container market excluding russia is approximately 52 billion containers and we are the second largest producer with an estimated 30 percent of european shipments the european market is highly regional in terms of sales growth rates and packaging mix 

  

in january 2011 ball completed the acquisition of aerocan sas aerocan a leading european supplier of extruded aluminum aerosol containers for €2217 million 2952 million in cash and assumed debt which is net of 262 million of cash acquired the acquisition of aerocan has enabled ball to expand into a new product category that is growing faster than other parts of our business while aligning with a new customer base at returns that meet or exceed the company’s cost of capital see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report for further details 

  

the metal beverage packaging europe segment which accounted for 23 percent of ball’s consolidated net sales in 2011 supplies twopiece metal beverage containers and ends for producers of carbonated soft drinks beer energy drinks and other beverages as well as extruded aluminum aerosol containers and aluminum slugs the european operations consist of 16 facilities — 10 beverage container facilities three extruded aluminum aerosol facilities two beverage end facilities and one aluminum slug facility — of which four are located in germany four in the united kingdom four in france and one each in the netherlands poland serbia and the czech republic in addition ball is currently renting additional space on the premises of a supplier in haslach germany in order to produce the ball resealable end bre the european beverage facilities produced approximately 17 billion metal beverage containers in 2011 with approximately 58 percent of those being produced from aluminum and 42 percent from steel six of the beverage container facilities use aluminum and four use steel the european aluminum aerosol facilities produced approximately 700 million aluminum aerosol containers in 2011 

  

sales volumes of metal beverage containers in europe tend to be highest during the period from may through august with a smaller increase in demand leading up to the winter holiday season in the united kingdom as in north america the metal beverage container competes aggressively with other packaging materials used by the european beer and carbonated soft drink industries the glass bottle is heavily utilized in the packaged beer industry while the pet container is utilized in the carbonated soft drink beer juice and mineral water industries 

  

  

european raw material supply contracts are generally for a period of one year although ball has negotiated some longer term agreements in europe three steel suppliers and four aluminum suppliers provide approximately 95 percent of our requirements aluminum is traded primarily in us dollars while the functional currencies of the european operations are nonus dollars the company generally tries to minimize the resulting exchange rate risk using derivative and supply contracts in local currencies in addition purchase and sales contracts generally include fixed price floating and passthrough pricing arrangements 

  

metal food and household products packaging americas segment 

  

the metal food and household products packaging americas segment accounted for 17 percent of consolidated net sales in 2011 ball produces twopiece and threepiece steel food containers and ends for packaging vegetables fruit soups meat seafood nutritional products pet food and other products the segment also manufactures and sells aerosol paint and general line containers as well as decorative specialty containers and aluminum slugs there are a total of 15 facilities in the us and canada that produce these products in addition the company manufactures and sells steel aerosol containers in two facilities in argentina 

  

sales volumes of metal food containers in north america tend to be highest from may through october as a result of seasonal fruit vegetable and salmon packs we estimate our 2011 shipments of approximately 5 billion steel food containers to be approximately 18 percent of total us and canadian metal food container shipments we estimate our aerosol business accounts for approximately 41 percent of total annual us and canadian steel aerosol shipments in the us and canada we are the leading supplier of aluminum slugs used in the production of extruded aluminum aerosol containers and estimate our percentage of the total industry shipments to be approximately 98 percent 

  

competitors in the metal food container product line include two national and a small number of regional suppliers and self manufacturers several producers in mexico also manufacture steel food containers competition in the us steel aerosol container market primarily includes three other national suppliers steel containers also compete with other packaging materials in the food and household products industry including glass aluminum plastic paper and the standup pouch as a result profitability for this product line is dependent on price cost reduction service and quality in north america two steel suppliers provide nearly 65 percent of our tinplate steel we believe we have limited our exposure related to changes in the costs of steel tinplate and aluminum as a result of the inclusion of provisions in many sales contracts to pass through steel and aluminum cost changes and the existence of certain other steel container sales contracts that incorporate annually negotiated metal costs in 2011 we were able to pass through the majority of steel cost increases levied by producers 

  

cost containment is crucial to maintaining profitability in the food and aerosol container manufacturing industries and ball is focused on doing so toward that end in the second quarter of 2011 ball closed its metal food container manufacturing facility in richmond british columbia and during prior years ball closed its aerosol container manufacturing facilities in tallapoosa georgia and commerce california the two aerosol facility closures resulted in a net reduction in manufacturing capacity of 10 production lines including the relocation of two highspeed aerosol lines to other existing ball facilities and allowed us to supply customers from a more consolidated asset base 

  

aerospace and technologies segment 

  

ball’s aerospace and technologies segment which accounted for 9 percent of consolidated net sales in 2011 includes national defense hardware antenna and video component technologies civil and operational space hardware and systems engineering services the segment develops spacecraft sensors and instruments radio frequency systems and other advanced technologies for the civil commercial and national security aerospace markets the majority of the aerospace and technologies business involves work under contracts generally from one to five years in duration as a prime contractor or subcontractor for the us department of defense dod the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and other us government agencies the company competes against both large and small prime contractors and subcontractors for these contracts contracts funded by the various agencies of the federal government represented 87 percent of segment sales in 2011 

  

intense competition and long operating cycles are key characteristics of both the company’s business and the aerospace and defense industry it is common in the aerospace and defense industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies a company competing to be a prime contractor may upon ultimate award of the contract to another competitor become a subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting company it is not unusual to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or a customer of that same competitor on other contracts or vice versa 

  

  

geopolitical events and shifting executive and legislative branch priorities have resulted in an increase in opportunities over the past decade in areas matching our aerospace and technologies segment’s core capabilities in space hardware in 2011 we saw an increase in space hardware orders our traditional strength combined with continued growth in opportunities related to our information services and tactical components the businesses include hardware software and services sold primarily to us customers with emphasis on space science and exploration environmental and earth sciences and defense and intelligence applications major activities frequently involve the design manufacture and testing of satellites remote sensors and ground station control hardware and software as well as related services such as launch vehicle integration and satellite operations uncertainties in the federal government budgeting process could delay the funding or even result in cancellation of certain programs currently in our reported backlog 

  

other hardware activities include target identification warning and attitude control systems and components cryogenic systems for reactant storage and associated sensor cooling devices star trackers which are generalpurpose stellar attitude sensors and faststeering mirrors additionally the aerospace and technologies segment provides diversified technical services and products to government agencies prime contractors and commercial organizations for a broad range of information warfare electronic warfare avionics intelligence training and space systems needs 

  

backlog in the aerospace and technologies segment was 897 million and 989 million at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively and consisted of the aggregate contract value of firm orders excluding amounts previously recognized as revenue the 2011 backlog includes 507 million expected to be recognized in revenues during 2012 with the remainder expected to be recognized in revenues thereafter unfunded amounts included in backlog for certain firm government orders which are subject to annual funding were 470 million and 620 million at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively yearoveryear comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations due to the nature of varying delivery and milestone schedules on contracts and funding of programs 

  

discontinued operations — plastic packaging americas 

  

in august 2010 we completed the sale of our plastics packaging americas business to amcor limited and received gross proceeds of 2587 million this amount included 15 million of contingent consideration recognized at closing and is net of postclosing adjustments of 213 million the sale of our plastics packaging business included five us facilities that manufactured polyethylene terephthalate pet bottles and preforms and polypropylene bottles as well as associated customer contracts and other related assets and liabilities 

  

patents 

  

in the opinion of the company’s management none of our active patents or groups of patents is material to the successful operation of our business as a whole we manage our intellectual property portfolio to obtain the durations necessary to achieve our business objectives 

  

research and development 

  

research and development rd efforts in our packaging segments are primarily directed toward packaging innovation specifically the development of new features sizes shapes and types of containers as well as new uses for existing containers other rd efforts in these segments seek to improve manufacturing efficiencies and the overall sustainability of our products our rd activities are primarily conducted in the ball technology  innovation center btic located in westminster colorado us and in a technical center located in bonn germany 

  

in our aerospace business we continue to focus our rd activities on the design development and manufacture of innovative aerospace products and systems this includes the production of spacecraft instruments and sensors radio frequency and system components data exploitation solutions and a variety of advanced aerospace technologies and products that enable deep space missions our aerospace rd activities are conducted at various locations in the us 

  

additional information regarding company rd activity is contained in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report as well as included in item 2 “properties” 

  

  

sustainability and the environment 

  

sustainability is a key part of maximizing value at ball we believe that our triple bottom line approach — balancing the economic environmental and social impacts of our products and operations in our decisionmaking process — creates longterm value for all of our stakeholders our priorities with regard to our people and the environment are to ensure the safety and development of our employees continue to increase the sustainability of our products and reduce waste and the use of energy and water in our operations 

  

metal packaging is the most recycled packaging in the world the 2010 recycling rate in the us for aluminum cans was 58 percent the highest recycling rate for any beverage container the 2009 us recycling rate for steel cans was 66 percent according to the most recently published data in north america the aluminum can sheet we buy contains an average of 68 percent total recycled content and the average total recycled content for steel sheet is 33 percent 

  

recycling rates vary throughout europe but average around 64 percent for aluminum containers and 72 percent for steel containers which exceeds the european union’s goal of 50 percent recycling for metals due in part to the intrinsic value of aluminum and steel metal packaging recycling rates in europe compare favorably to those of other packaging materials ball’s european operations help establish and financially support recycling initiatives in growing markets such as poland and serbia to educate consumers about the benefits of recycling aluminum and steel containers and to increase recycling rates we have initiated a similar program in the prc to educate consumers in that market regarding the benefits of recycling 

  

compliance with federal state provincial and local laws relating to protection of the environment has not had a material adverse effect upon the capital expenditures earnings or competitive position of the company as more fully described in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report various federal and state environmental agencies have designated the company as a potentially responsible party along with numerous other companies for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites however the company’s information at this time indicates that these matters will not have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity results of operations or financial condition of the company 

  

while deposit systems and other containerrelated legislation have been adopted in some jurisdictions similar legislation has been defeated in public referenda and legislative bodies in many others the company anticipates that continuing efforts will be made to consider and adopt such legislation in the future the packages we produce are widely used and perform well in us states canadian provinces and european countries that have deposit systems as well as in other countries worldwide 

  

employee relations 

  

at the end of 2011 the company and its subsidiaries employed approximately 9100 employees in the us and 5900 in other countries details of collective bargaining agreements are included within item 1a risk factors of this annual report

 item 1a   risk factors 

  

any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

our business operating results and financial condition are subject to particular risks in certain regions of the world 

  

we may experience an operating loss in one or more regions of the world for one or more periods which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition moreover overcapacity which often leads to lower prices exists in a number of the regions in which we operate and may persist even if demand grows our ability to manage such operational fluctuations and to maintain adequate longterm strategies in the face of such developments will be critical to our continued growth and profitability 

  

there can be no assurance that the company’s business acquisitions will be successfully integrated into the acquiring company see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report for details of acquisitions made during the three years ended december 31 2011 

  

while we have what we believe to be well designed integration plans if we cannot successfully integrate the acquired operations with those of ball we may experience material negative consequences to our business financial condition or results of operations the integration of companies that have previously been operated separately involves a number of risks including but not limited to 

  

·   demands on management related to the increase in our size after the acquisition 

·   the diversion of management’s attention from the management of existing operations to the integration of the acquired operations 

·   difficulties in the assimilation and retention of employees 

·   difficulties in the integration of departments systems including accounting systems technologies books and records and procedures as well as in maintaining uniform standards controls including internal accounting controls procedures and policies 

·   expenses related to any undisclosed or potential liabilities and 

·   retention of major customers and suppliers 

  

we may not be able to achieve potential synergies or maintain the levels of revenue earnings or operating efficiency that each business had achieved or might achieve separately the successful integration of the acquired operations will depend on our ability to manage those operations realize revenue opportunities and to some degree eliminate redundant and excess costs 

  

the loss of a key customer or a reduction in its requirements could have a significant negative impact on our sales 

  

we sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major beverage packaged food personal care and household product companies some of which operate in north america south america europe and asia 

  

although the majority of our customer contracts are longterm these contracts are terminable under certain circumstances such as our failure to meet quality volume or market pricing requirements because we depend on relatively few major customers our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss of any of these customers a reduction in the purchasing levels of these customers a strike or work stoppage by a significant number of these customers’ employees or an adverse change in the terms of the supply agreements with these customers 

  

the primary customers for our aerospace segment are us government agencies or their prime contractors our contracts with these customers are subject to several risks including funding cuts and delays technical uncertainties budget changes competitive activity and changes in scope 

  

  

we face competitive risks from many sources that may negatively impact our profitability 

  

competition within the packaging and aerospace industries is intense increases in productivity combined with existing or potential surplus capacity in the industry have maintained competitive pricing pressures the principal methods of competition in the general packaging industry are price innovation and sustainability service and quality in the aerospace industry they are technical capability cost and schedule some of our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources and some may currently have significant excess capacity our current or potential competitors may offer products at a lower price or products that are deemed superior to ours the global economic environment has resulted in reductions in demand for our products in some instances which in turn could increase these competitive pressures 

  

we are subject to competition from alternative products which could result in lower profits and reduced cash flows 

  

our metal packaging products are subject to significant competition from substitute products particularly plastic carbonated soft drink bottles made from pet single serve beer bottles and other food and beverage containers made of glass cardboard or other materials competition from plastic carbonated soft drink bottles is particularly intense in the us europe and the prc certain of our aerospace products are also subject to competition from alternative products and solutions there can be no assurance that our products will successfully compete against alternative products which could result in a reduction in our profits or cash flow 

  

our packaging businesses have a narrow product range and our business would suffer if usage of our products decreased 

  

for the 12 months ended december 31 2011 75 percent of our consolidated net sales were from the sale of metal beverage containers and we expect to derive a significant portion of our future revenues and cash flows from the sale of metal beverage containers our business would suffer if the use of metal beverage containers decreased accordingly broad acceptance by consumers of aluminum and steel containers for a wide variety of beverages is critical to our future success if demand for glass and pet bottles increases relative to metal containers or the demand for aluminum and steel containers does not develop as expected our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

  

changes in laws and governmental regulations may adversely affect our business and operations 

  

we and our customers and suppliers are subject to various federal state and provincial laws and regulations which are increasing in number and complexity each of our and their facilities is subject to federal state provincial and local licensing and regulation by health environmental workplace safety and other agencies in multiple jurisdictions requirements of governmental authorities with respect to manufacturing manufacturing facility locations within the jurisdiction product content and safety climate change workplace safety and health environmental expropriation of assets and other standards could adversely affect our ability to manufacture or sell our products and the ability of our customers and suppliers to manufacture and sell their products in addition we face risks arising from compliance with and enforcement of increasingly numerous and complex federal state and provincial laws and regulations 

  

significant environmental employmentrelated and other legislation and regulatory requirements exist and are also evolving the compliance costs associated with current and proposed laws and potential regulations could be substantial and any failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws or regulations could lead to litigation or governmental action all of which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

  

our business financial condition and results of operations are subject to risks resulting from broader geographic operations 

  

we derived approximately 38 percent of our consolidated net sales from outside of the us for the year ended december 31 2011 this sizeable scope of operations outside of the us may lead to more volatile financial results and make it more difficult for us to manage our business reasons for this include but are not limited to the following 

  

·   political and economic instability in international markets 

·   governments’ restrictive trade policies 

·   the imposition of duties taxes or government royalties 

·   exchange rate risks 

·   difficulties in enforcement of contractual obligations and intellectual property rights and 

·   the geographic language and cultural differences between personnel in different areas of the world 

  

  

any of these factors many of which are also present in the us could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

we are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations 

  

our reporting currency is the us dollar historically a portion of ball’s operations including assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses have been denominated in various currencies other than the us dollar and we expect such operations will continue to be so denominated as a result the us dollar value of these operations has varied and will continue to vary with exchange rate fluctuations ball has been and is presently primarily exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate of the euro british pound canadian dollar polish zloty chinese yuan and the brazilian real we are also exposed to a lesser extent to fluctuations in the argentine peso serbian dinar and czech koruna 

  

a decrease in the value of any of these currencies compared to the us dollar could reduce our profits from these operations and the value of their net assets when reported in us dollars in our financial statements this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations as reported in us dollars in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to currencies in which the earnings are generated may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations 

  

we manage our exposure to currency fluctuations particularly our exposure to fluctuations in the euro to us dollar exchange rate in order to attempt to mitigate the effect of cash flow and earnings volatility associated with exchange rate changes we primarily use forward contracts and options to manage our currency exposures and as a result we experience gains and losses on these derivative positions offset in part by the impact of currency fluctuations on existing assets and liabilities our inability to properly manage our exposure to currency fluctuations could materially impact our results 

  

if we fail to retain key management and personnel we may be unable to implement our key objectives 

  

we believe that our future success depends in part on our experienced management team unforeseen losses of key members of our management team without appropriate succession and or compensation planning could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet our objectives 

  

decreases in our ability to apply new technology and knowhow may affect our competitiveness 

  

our success depends partially on our ability to improve production processes and services we must also introduce new products and services to meet changing customer needs if we are unable to implement better production processes or to develop new products we may not be able to remain competitive with other manufacturers as a result our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

adverse weather and climate changes may result in lower sales 

  

we manufacture packaging products primarily for beverages and foods unseasonably cool weather can reduce demand for certain beverages packaged in our containers in addition poor weather conditions or changes in climate that reduce crop yields of fruits and vegetables can adversely affect demand for our food containers climate change could have various effects on the demand for our products in different regions around the world 

  

we are vulnerable to fluctuations in the supply and price of raw materials 

  

we purchase aluminum steel and other raw materials and packaging supplies from several sources while all such materials are available from independent suppliers raw materials are subject to fluctuations in price and availability attributable to a number of factors including general economic conditions commodity price fluctuations particularly aluminum on the london metal exchange the demand by other industries for the same raw materials and the availability of complementary and substitute materials although we enter into commodities purchase agreements from time to time and sometimes use derivative instruments to seek to manage our risk we cannot ensure that our current suppliers of raw materials will be able to supply us with sufficient quantities at reasonable prices economic and financial factors could impact our suppliers thereby causing supply shortages increases in raw material costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in the americas europe and asia some contracts do not allow us to pass along increased raw material costs and we generally use derivative agreements to seek to manage this risk our hedging procedures may be insufficient and our results could be materially impacted if costs of materials increase due to the fixed price contracts and derivative activities while increasing raw material costs may not impact our nearterm profitability increased prices could decrease our sales volume over time 

  

  

prolonged work stoppages at facilities with union employees could jeopardize our financial position 

  

as of december 31 2011 approximately 50 percent of our approximately 4800 north american packaging facility employees and approximately 84 percent of our european packaging plant employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements these collective bargaining agreements have staggered expirations during the next several years although we consider our employee relations to be generally good a prolonged work stoppage or strike at any facility with union employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition we cannot ensure that upon the expiration of existing collective bargaining agreements new agreements will be reached without union action or that any such new agreements will be on terms satisfactory to us 

  

our aerospace and technologies segment is subject to certain risks specific to that business 

  

in our aerospace business us government contracts are subject to reduction or modification in the event of changes in requirements or budgetary constraints and the government may also terminate contracts at its convenience pursuant to standard termination provisions in such instances ball may be entitled to reimbursement for allowable cost and profits on authorized work that has been performed through the date of termination 

  

we use estimates in accounting for many of our programs in our aerospace business and changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results 

  

we account for sales and profits on some longterm contracts in our aerospace business in accordance with the percentageofcompletion method of accounting using the cumulative catchup method to account for updates in estimates the percentageofcompletion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project revenues and costs at completion and various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events including the quantity and timing of product deliveries future labor performance and rates and material and overhead costs these assumptions involve various levels of expected performance improvements under the cumulative catchup method the impact of updates in our estimates related to units shipped to date is recognized immediately 

  

because of the significance of the judgments and estimates described above it is likely that we could record materially different amounts if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances or estimates were to change accordingly updates in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates may materially affect our future financial performance 

  

our backlog includes both costtype and fixedprice contracts costtype contracts generally have lower profit margins than fixedprice contracts our earnings and margins may vary depending on the types of government contracts undertaken the nature of the work performed under those contracts the costs incurred in performing the work the achievement of other performance objectives and their impact on our ability to receive fees 

  

our business is subject to substantial environmental remediation and compliance costs 

  

our operations are subject to federal state provincial and local laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions relating to environmental hazards such as emissions to air discharges to water the handling and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes and the cleanup of hazardous substances we have been designated along with numerous other companies as a potentially responsible party for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites based on available information we do not believe that any costs incurred in connection with such sites will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations capital expenditures or competitive position there is increased focus on the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental issues worldwide 

  

our business faces the potential of increased regulation on some of the raw materials utilized in our packaging operations 

  

our operations are subject to federal state provincial and local laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions relating to some of the raw materials such as epoxybased coatings utilized in our can making process epoxybased coatings may contain bisphenola bpa scientific evidence evaluated by regulatory agencies in the united states europe japan australia and new zealand has consistently shown these coatings to be safe and regulatory agencies have stated that human exposure to bpa from epoxybased can coatings is well below safe exposure limits set by government bodies worldwide a significant change in these regulatory agency statements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations ball recognizes that significant interest exists in non epoxybased coatings and we have been proactively working with coatings suppliers and our customers to evaluate alternatives to current coatings 

  

  

net earnings and net worth could be materially affected by an impairment of goodwill 

  

we have a significant amount of goodwill recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2011 we are required at least annually to test the recoverability of goodwill the recoverability test of goodwill is based on the current fair value of our identified reporting units fair value measurement requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors including revenue and market growth operating cash flows and discount rates if general market conditions deteriorate in portions of our business we could experience a significant decline in the fair value of reporting units this decline could lead to an impairment of all or a significant portion of the goodwill balance which could materially affect our us gaap net earnings and net worth 

  

if the investments in ball’s pension plans do not perform as expected we may have to contribute additional amounts to the plans which would otherwise be available to cover operating expenses and fund growth opportunities 

  

ball maintains defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of its north american and united kingdom employees which are funded based on certain actuarial assumptions the plans’ assets consist primarily of common stocks fixed income securities and in the us alternative investments market declines longevity increases or legislative changes such as the pension protection act in the us could result in a prospective decrease in our available cash flow and net earnings over time and the recognition of an increase in our pension obligations could result in a reduction to our shareholders’ equity 

  

restricted access to capital markets could adversely affect our shortterm liquidity and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the notes issued pursuant to our bond indentures 

  

on december 31 2011 we had total debt of 31 billion and unused committed credit lines of approximately 1 billion a reduction in global market liquidity could 

  

·   restrict our ability to fund working capital capital expenditures research and development expenditures and other business activities 

·   increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions including the credit risks stemming from the economic environment 

·   limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate 

·   restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities and 

·   limit along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt among other things our ability to borrow additional funds dispose of assets pay cash dividends or refinance debt maturities 

  

in addition approximately onethird of our debt bears interest at variable rates if market interest rates increase variablerate debt will create higher debt service requirements which would adversely affect our cash flow while we sometimes enter into agreements limiting our exposure any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk 

  

the global credit financial and economic environment could have a negative impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

the overall credit financial and economic environment could have significant negative effects on our operations including the following 

  

·   the creditworthiness of customers suppliers and counterparties could deteriorate resulting in a financial loss or a disruption in our supply of raw materials 

·   volatile market performance could affect the fair value of our pension assets potentially requiring us to make significant additional contributions to our defined benefit plans to maintain prescribed funding levels 

·   a significant weakening of our financial position or operating results could result in noncompliance with our debt covenants and 

·   reduced cash flow from our operations could adversely affect our ability to execute our longterm strategy to increase liquidity reduce debt repurchase our stock and invest in our businesses 

  

  

changes in us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap and securities and exchange commission sec rules and regulations could materially impact our reported results 

  

us gaap and sec accounting and reporting changes are common and have become more frequent and significant over the past several years furthermore the us and international accounting standard setters are in the process of jointly converging several key accounting standards these changes could have significant effects on our reported results when compared to prior periods and other companies and may even require us to retrospectively adjust prior periods additionally material changes to the presentation of transactions in the consolidated financial statements could impact key ratios that analysts and credit rating agencies use to rate ball and ultimately our ability to access the credit markets in an efficient manner 

  

increased information technology it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems networks products solutions and services 

  

increased global it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures including employee training comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems our systems networks products solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats depending on their nature and scope such threats could potentially lead to the compromise of confidential information improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which in turn could adversely affect our reputation competitiveness and results of operations

overview 

  

business overview 

  

ball corporation is one of the world’s leading suppliers of metal packaging to the beverage food personal care and household products industries our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses and are manufactured in facilities around the world we also provide aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers 

  

we sell our packaging products mainly to large multinational beverage food personal care and household products companies with which we have developed longterm customer relationships this is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of longterm supply contracts while we have a diversified customer base we sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major companies in north america europe the prc brazil and argentina as do our equity joint ventures in the us and vietnam the primary customers for the products and services provided by our aerospace and technologies segment are us government agencies or their prime contractors 

  

industry trends and corporate strategy 

  

in the rigid packaging industry sales and earnings can be improved by reducing costs increasing prices developing new products expanding volumes and making strategic acquisitions over the past few years we have closed a number of packaging facilities in support of our ongoing objective of matching our supply with market demand we have also identified and implemented plans to improve our return on invested capital through the redeployment of assets within our global operations to better realign capacity in 2011 we closed our torrance california us facility relocated one of the lines to our whitby ontario canada facility relocated one line from lublin poland to our belgrade serbia facility reduced capacity in our columbus ohio us metal beverage facility and redeployed surplus equipment to other global locations 

  

as part of our drive for 10 vision we are focused on developing and marketing new and existing products that meet the needs of our customers and the ultimate consumer we have been placing additional emphasis on technology and innovation throughout our businesses during 2011 and will continue to do so in 2012 and beyond these innovations include new shapes sizes opening features and other functional benefits as well as increasing the use of recycled content and lightweighting of our packages this ongoing packaging development activity helps us maintain and expand our supply positions with major beverage food personal care and household products customers our sustainability vision encompasses balancing economic environmental and social impacts in our decision making and activities successfully executing this vision will create longterm shared value for our stakeholders and ball is committed to practicing sustainability as a way of doing business our sustainability report and updates on our progress are available at wwwballcomsustainability 

  

the north american metal beverage container manufacturing industry is relatively mature and industry volumes for certain types of containers have declined over the past several years as a result we have reduced our excess capacity in certain north american metal beverage facilities for those containers the metal beverage container industries in other parts of the world are growing and are expected to continue to grow in the medium to long term we have been able to capitalize on this growth by adding a facility as well as additional capacity in our latapackball consolidated brazilian joint venture and by increasing capacity in some of our european metal beverage container manufacturing facilities by speeding up 

  

  

certain lines and by expansion in 2011 we expanded our lightweight alumitek® bottle production to our golden colorado facility and we commenced specialty can production in our fort worth texas us facility we also announced that latapackball would construct a new metal beverage container manufacturing facility in alagoinhas bahia which is in northeast brazil one of the fastest growing regions of the country the new facility will begin production in early 2012 the output from the first line has been contracted for sale under a longterm agreement additionally in march 2011 we entered into a joint venture agreement with thai beverage can limited to construct a beverage container manufacturing facility in vietnam that will begin production in the first quarter of 2012 

  

we have also made recent strategic acquisitions in october 2011 we acquired our partners’ interests in qmcp and recorded a gain of 92 million related to our previously held interest in the joint venture additionally we are constructing a new expanded beverage container facility for qmcp that will begin production in the first quarter of 2012 in july 2010 we entered the aluminum slug market by acquiring the leading north american manufacturer of aluminum slugs used to make extruded aerosol containers beverage bottles collapsible tubes and technical impact extrusions to further expand this new product line and broaden our market development efforts into a new customer base in january 2011 we acquired a leading european supplier of aluminum aerosol containers and bottles and the slugs used to make them further details of recent acquisitions are included in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report 

  

we recognize sales under longterm contracts in the aerospace and technologies segment using percentage of completion under the costtocost method of accounting the 2011 contract mix consisted of approximately 60 percent costtype contracts which are billed at our costs plus an agreed upon andor earned profit component and 33 percent fixedprice contracts the remainder represents time and material contracts which typically provide for the sale of engineering labor at fixed hourly rates the contracted backlog at december 31 2011 of approximately 897 million consisted of approximately 50 percent fixed price contracts indicating a continuing trend towards more fixed price business 

  

throughout the period of contract performance we regularly reevaluate and if necessary revise our estimates of aerospace and technologies total contract revenue total contract cost and progress toward completion because of contract payment schedules limitations on funding and other contract terms our sales and accounts receivable for this segment include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed 

  

management performance measures 

  

management uses various measures to evaluate company performance such as return on average invested capital net operating earnings after tax over the relevant performance period divided by average invested capital over the same period economic value added net operating earnings after tax less a capital charge on average invested capital employed earnings before interest and taxes ebit earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda diluted earnings per share cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow generally defined by the company as cash flow from operating activities less additions to property plant and equipment these financial measures may be adjusted at times for items that affect comparability between periods such as business consolidation costs and gains or losses on acquisitions and dispositions nonfinancial measures in the packaging businesses include production efficiency and spoilage rates quality control figures environmental health and safety statistics production and sales volumes asset utilization rates and measures of sustainability additional measures used to evaluate financial performance in the aerospace and technologies segment include contract revenue realization award and incentive fees realized proposal win rates and backlog including awarded contracted and funded backlog 

  

  

results of operations 

  

consolidated sales and earnings 

  

   

the increase in net sales in 2011 compared to 2010 was driven largely by the increase in demand for metal packaging in the prc improved beverage container volumes in the americas the consolidation of latapackball the acquisition of two prc joint ventures and the extruded aluminum businesses and improved aerospace program performance in addition to the business segment performance analyzed below net earnings attributable to ball corporation included discontinued operations related to the sale of the plastics business in august 2010 business consolidation costs debt refinancing costs and the equity earnings and gains on the acquisitions these items are detailed in the “management performance measures” section below 

  

higher sales in 2010 compared to 2009 were due largely to sales associated with 2010 business acquisitions described above the higher net earnings from continuing operations in 2010 compared to 2009 included 1059 million of equity gains on acquisitions associated with the acquisitions 

  

business segment discussions 

  

the company has four reportable segments 1 metal beverage packaging americas and asia aggregated based on qualitative and quantitative characteristics 2 metal beverage packaging europe 3 metal food and household products packaging americas and 4 aerospace and technologies we also have investments in companies in the us and vietnam which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and accordingly those results are not included in segment sales or earnings 

  

metal beverage packaging americas and asia 

  

   

a   further details of these items are included in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

  

the metal beverage packaging americas and asia segment consists of operations located in the us canada brazil since august 2010 and the prc which manufacture metal container products used in beverage packaging as well as nonbeverage plastic containers manufactured and sold mainly in the prc our acquisition of the remaining 60 percent interest in qmcp was completed in october 2011 and our acquisition of our partner’s 65 percent interest in jfp was completed in june 2010 in august 2010 we acquired an additional economic interest in latapackball the results of the acquired entities have been included in the metal beverage packaging americas and asia segment since the acquisition dates the acquisitions are discussed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

  

segment sales in 2011 were 5654 million higher compared to 2010 attributable mainly to 268 million from the consolidation of latapackball and the acquisition of two prc joint ventures 190 million from higher sales volumes and 96 million from higher commodity input prices 

  

segment sales in 2010 were 9593 million higher than in 2009 primarily due to the four facilities acquired from ab inbev additional sales associated with jfp and the consolidation of the latapackball joint venture since august 2010 

  

  

segment earnings in 2011 were 634 million higher than in 2010 due to 45 million from the consolidation of latapackball and the acquisition of two prc joint venture interests 35 million from higher sales volumes and 16 million from improved manufacturing performance partially offset by 38 million of higher manufacturing and distribution costs 

  

segment earnings in 2010 were 1223 million higher than in 2009 primarily due to a net 85 million impact from higher sales volumes and 45 million from product mix and improved manufacturing performance associated with higher production also adding to the 2010 improvement was the effect of a 7 million outofperiod inventory charge in 2009 the details of the outofperiod adjustment are included in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included within item 8 of this annual report 

  

metal beverage packaging europe 

  

   

a   further details of these items are included in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

  

the metal beverage packaging europe segment includes the manufacture of metal beverage containers extruded aluminum aerosol containers and aluminum slugs ball has manufacturing facilities located in germany the united kingdom france the netherlands poland serbia and the czech republic 

  

in january 2011 ball acquired aerocan sas aerocan a leading european supplier of aluminum aerosol containers and bottles for €2217 million 2952 million in cash and assumed debt which is net of 262 million of cash acquired aerocan manufactures extruded aluminum aerosol containers and bottles and the aluminum slugs used to make them for customers in the personal care pharmaceutical beverage and food industries it operates three aerosol container manufacturing facilities — one each in the czech republic france and the united kingdom — and is a 51 percent owner of a joint venture aluminum slug facility in france the acquisition of aerocan has enabled ball to expand into a new product category that is growing faster than other parts of our business and to align with a new customer base at returns that meet or exceed the company’s cost of capital 

  

segment sales in 2011 increased 3185 million compared to 2010 due to 180 million from the inclusion of aerocan sales 100 million from the effect of currency exchange rates and 31 million from higher sales volumes 

  

segment sales in 2010 decreased 404 million compared to 2009 primarily due to unfavorable currency exchange effects of 93 million and price and mix changes partially offset by higher sales volumes 

  

segment earnings in 2011 increased 302 million compared to 2010 due to 38 million earnings contribution from the aerocan acquisition 13 million from the effect of currency exchange rates and 13 million from higher volumes partially offset by 35 million from higher inventory and other costs 

  

segment earnings in 2010 decreased 13 million compared to 2009 primarily due to the result of a 28 million increase from higher sales volumes offset by 18 million from negative effects from currency translation and 12 million of higher inventory and other costs 

  

  

metal food and household products packaging americas 

  

   

a   further details of these items are included in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

  

the metal food and household products packaging americas segment consists of operations located in the us canada and argentina that manufacture and sell metal food aerosol paint and general line containers as well as decorative specialty containers and with the july 2010 acquisition of neuman aluminum aluminum slugs 

  

segment sales in 2011 increased 563 million compared to 2010 primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of aluminum slug sales associated with the neuman facilities of 108 million and improved pricing and sales mix partially offset by 73 million from lower can sales volumes 

  

segment sales in 2010 declined 228 million compared to 2009 largely the result of 88 million from lower commodity prices partially offset by the sales associated with the neuman facilities 

  

segment earnings in 2011 increased 46 million compared to 2010 mainly due to the year over year impact of lower cost inventory of 16 million in 2011 contribution from a full year of aluminum slug sales and improved pricing and sales mix partially offset by lower sales volumes of 16 million and unfavorable manufacturing performance due to higher fourth quarter 2011 production curtailments 

  

segment earnings in 2010 decreased 17 million compared to 2009 primarily due to 44 million of lower cost inventory carried into 2009 that did not occur in 2010 substantially offset by improved manufacturing and cost performance favorable product sales mix and the addition of the neuman facilities 

  

aerospace and technologies 

  

   

the aerospace and technologies segment consists of the manufacture and sale of aerospace and other related products and providing services used in the defense civil space and commercial space industries 

  

segment sales in 2011 increased 709 million compared to 2010 primarily due to higher sales from us national defense contracts and existing commercial programs partially offset by lower sales from civil space programs 

  

segment sales in 2010 as compared to the prior year increased by 245 million primarily due to increased scope on existing programs and new program starts including worldview3 and several large classified programs these increases were partially offset by the cancellation of the orion program and the completion of several large programs including kepler and worldview2 

  

in addition to worldview3 some of the segment’s other highprofile contracts include the james webb space telescope a successor to the hubble space telescope the joint polar satellite system the nextgeneration satellite weather monitoring system the global precipitation measurementmicrowave imager which will play an essential role in the earth’s weather and environmental forecasting and a number of antennas and sensors for the joint strike fighter 

  

segment earnings in 2011 as compared to 2010 increased 98 million due to increased sales volume improved performance on fixedprice contracts and better award fees on several of our large cost plus contracts 

  

segment earnings in 2010 as compared to 2009 increased by 84 million due to favorable fixedprice program performance and higher sales partially offset by the program reductions described above 

  

  

sales to the us government either directly as a prime contractor or indirectly as a subcontractor represented 87 percent of segment sales in 2011 96 percent in 2010 and 94 percent in 2009 contracted backlog for the aerospace and technologies segment at december 31 2011 and 2010 was 897 million and 989 million respectively comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations due to the nature of varying delivery and milestone schedules on contracts and funding of programs 

  

discontinued operations — plastic packaging americas 

  

in august 2010 we completed the sale of our plastics packaging americas business to amcor limited and received proceeds of 2587 million which included 15 million of contingent consideration recognized at closing and is net of postclosing adjustments of 213 million the sale of our plastics packaging business included five us facilities that manufactured polyethylene terephthalate pet bottles and preforms and polypropylene bottles as well as associated customer contracts and other related assets 

  

the following table summarizes the operating results for the discontinued operations for the years ended december 31 

  

   

a   includes net charges recorded to reflect costs associated with the closure of plastics packaging manufacturing facilities 

  

additional segment information 

  

for additional information regarding our segments see the business segment information in note 2 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report the charges recorded for business consolidation activities were based on estimates by ball management and were developed from information available at the time if actual outcomes vary from the estimates the differences will be reflected in current period earnings in the consolidated statement of earnings and identified as business consolidation gains and losses additional details about our business consolidation activities and associated costs are provided in note 5 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

  

selling general and administrative expenses 

  

selling general and administrative sga expenses were 3814 million in 2011 3568 million in 2010 and 3090 million in 2009 the increase in sga in 2011 compared to 2010 was due to 9 million from unfavorable currency exchange effects the consolidation of our acquisitions and other individually insignificant higher costs 

  

the increase in sga expenses in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to 26 million from higher employee compensation costs including incentive compensation and stockbased compensation and fair value adjustments for the company’s deferred compensation stock plans 15 million from nonrecurring gains in 2009 and 12 million of other higher costs partially offset lower bad debt expense 

  

  

interest and taxes 

  

consolidated interest expense was 1771 million in 2011 1582 million in 2010 and 1172 million in 2009 the higher interest expense in 2011 compared to 2010 excluding debt refinancing costs was due to higher levels of debt related to the acquisitions of aerocan jfp and neuman the consolidation of latapackball and higher share repurchases as well as the refinancing of the company’s bank credit facilities in december 2010 the higher expense in 2010 compared to 2009 was due to higher levels of debt including the issuance of 500 million of senior notes in november 2010 and 700 million of senior notes in august 2009 interest expense in 2010 included 88 million for the call premium and write off of unamortized financing costs and unamortized issuance premiums related to the redemption of ball’s senior notes due december 2012 as well as the refinancing of our senior credit facilities in december 2010 

  

the increase in the 2011 full year effective income tax rate of 305 percent as compared to 2010 of 290 percent was primarily due to significant discrete period tax benefits in 2010 not recurring in 2011 related to a change in entity status of a foreign subsidiary and the 2010 worldwide debt refinancing the impact of these two nonrecurring items was partially offset by a lower 2011 effective income tax rate on foreign earnings primarily related to the inclusion of a full year of brazil’s results and the acquisition of aerocan both of which have income tax holidays 

  

the tax rate for 2010 as compared to 2009 included the accrual of a net 8 million tax benefit due to a change in the tax status of a foreign investment a net 118 million benefit related to the refinancing of the company’s senior credit facilities and increased us manufacturing tax benefits offset by a higher 2010 tax provision for uncertain tax positions and an 85 million tax benefit realized in 2009 on the sale of shares in a stock investment resulting from a basis difference 

  

results of equity affiliates 

  

in october 2011 we acquired our partners’ 60 percent equity interests in qmcp and recorded a gain of 92 million on the fair value of our previously held equity ownership as a result of the required purchased accounting additionally in march 2011 we entered into a joint venture agreement with thai beverage can limited to construct a beverage container manufacturing facility in vietnam that will begin production in the first quarter of 2012 

  

in august 2010 we acquired an additional 101 percent economic interest in our brazilian beverage packaging joint venture latapackball increasing our overall economic ownership interest in the joint venture to 601 percent in connection with the acquisition of the additional interest in latapackball we recorded a gain of 818 million on the fair value of the previously held 50 percent equity ownership as a result of the required purchase accounting 

  

in june 2010 we acquired our partner’s 65 percent interest in jfp for 869 million in cash net of cash acquired and assumed debt and also entered into a longterm supply agreement in connection with the acquisition we recorded equity earnings of 241 million which was composed of equity earnings gains on the forgiveness of debt and guarantees and a gain realized on the fair value of ball’s equity investment as a result of the required purchase accounting 

  

  

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

  

cash flows and capital expenditures 

  

our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities and external committed borrowings we believe that cash flows from operations and cash provided by shortterm and committed revolver borrowings when necessary will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements scheduled principal and interest payments on debt dividend payments and anticipated capital expenditures the following summarizes our cash flows 

  

   

cash flows provided by operating activities in 2010 included 250 million related to a change in accounting for our accounts receivable securitization program at december 31 2009 the amount of accounts receivable sold under the securitization program was 250 million and under the previous accounting guidance this amount was presented in the consolidated balance sheet as a reduction of accounts receivable as a result of the true sale of receivables however upon the adoption of prospective accounting guidance effective january 1 2010 the amount of accounts receivable sold is not reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable which resulted in a 250 million working capital outflow from operating activities in the statement of cash flows 

  

cash flows from operations were 9484 million in 2011 compared to 7652 million in 2010 excluding the 250 million impact of additional accounts receivable from the change in accounting discussed above and 5597 million in 2009 higher operating cash flows in 2011 compared to 2010 were due primarily to higher earnings before interest and taxes favorable working capital changes the consolidation of latapackball and lower pension funding the significant improvement in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to higher earnings and favorable working capital changes partially offset by higher pension funding 

  

annual cash dividends paid on common stock were 28 cents per share in 2011 and 20 cents per share in 2010 and 2009 total dividends paid were 457 million in 2011 358 million in 2010 and 374 million in 2009 on january 25 2012 the company’s board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend to 10 cents per share beginning with the march 15 2012 payment date 

  

share repurchases 

  

the company’s share repurchases net of issuances totaled 4739 million in 2011 5067 million in 2010 and 51 million in 2009 the repurchases were completed using cash on hand and available borrowings and included accelerated share repurchase agreements and other purchases under our ongoing share repurchase program additional details about our share repurchase activities are provided in note 15 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

  

on february 1 2012 in a privately negotiated transaction ball entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement to buy 200 million of our common shares using cash on hand and available borrowings the company advanced the 200 million on february 3 2012 and received 4584819 shares which represented 90 percent of the total shares as calculated using the closing price on january 31 2011 of 3926 the final number of shares will be determined based on the volume weighted average trading price of the company’s shares over an agreed upon period of time 

  

  

debt facilities and refinancing 

  

the senior credit facilities bear interest at variable rates and include a 195 million term a loan denominated in us dollars a £50 million term b loan denominated in british sterling and a €99 million term c loan denominated in euros the facilities also include a longterm multicurrency committed revolving credit facility that provides the company with up to the us dollar equivalent of 1 billion 

  

total interestbearing debt of 31 billion at december 31 2011 was higher than the amount outstanding at december 31 2010 of 28 billion the increase in debt was due primarily to the company’s acquisition of aerocan for approximately 300 million as all free cash flow was returned to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends 

  

in november 2010 ball issued 500 million of new 575 percent senior notes due in may 2021 and in march 2010 ball issued 500 million of new 675 percent senior notes due in september 2020 on april 21 2010 the company redeemed 509 million of 6875 percent senior notes due december 2012 at a redemption price of 101146 percent of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest the redemption resulted in a charge of 81 million for the call premium and the write off of unamortized financing costs and unamortized premiums an additional 07 million of charges were recorded in connection with the refinancing of the company’s senior credit facilities in 2010 the charges are included as a component of interest expense in the consolidated financial statements 

  

in august 2011 the company entered into an accounts receivable securitization agreement for a term of three years the maximum the company can borrow under this agreement may vary between 150 million and 275 million depending on the seasonal accounts receivable balances in the company’s north american packaging businesses at december 31 2011 2310 million of accounts receivable have been sold under this agreement borrowings under the securitization agreement are included within the shortterm debt and current portion of longterm debt line on the balance sheet there were no accounts receivable sold at december 31 2010 under the company’s previous securitization program 

  

at december 31 2011 taking into account outstanding letters of credit approximately 1 billion was available under the company’s committed multicurrency revolving credit facilities in addition to these longterm committed credit facilities the company had approximately 465 million of shortterm uncommitted credit facilities available at the end of 2011 of which 1486 million was outstanding and due on demand 

  

given our free cash flow projections and unused credit facilities that are available until december 2015 our liquidity is strong and is expected to meet our ongoing cash and debt service requirements while ongoing financial and economic conditions raise concerns about credit risk with counterparties to derivative transactions the company mitigates its exposure by spreading the risk among various counterparties and limiting exposure to any one party we also monitor the credit ratings of our suppliers customers lenders and counterparties on a regular basis 

  

we were in compliance with all loan agreements at december 31 2011 and all prior years presented and have met all debt payment obligations the us note agreements and bank credit agreement contain certain restrictions relating to dividends investments financial ratios guarantees and the incurrence of additional indebtedness additional details about our debt and receivables sales agreements are available in note 12 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

  

other liquidity measures 

  

the following financial measurements are on a nonus gaap basis and should be considered in connection with the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report nonus gaap measures should not be considered in isolation and should not be considered superior to or a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with us gaap a presentation of earnings in accordance with us gaap is available in item 8 of this annual report 

  

free cash flow 

  

management internally uses a free cash flow measure 1 to evaluate the company’s operating results 2 to plan stock buyback levels and 3 to evaluate the company’s ability to incur and service debt free cash flow is not a defined term under us gaap and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures the company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less additions to property plant and equipment capital spending free cash flow is typically derived directly from the company’s cash flow statements however it may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods 

  

  

based on the above definition our consolidated free cash flow is summarized as follows 

  

   

based on information currently available we estimate cash flows from operating activities for 2012 to be in excess of 850 million capital spending to be approximately 400 million and free cash flow to be in the range of 450 million in 2012 we intend to utilize our operating cash flow to continue to fund our stock repurchases dividend payments growth capital projects and to the extent available acquisitions that meet our various criteria 

  

comparable ebit comparable net earnings comparable ebitda and ratios 

  

management internally uses comparable earnings before interest and taxes comparable ebit comparable earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization comparable ebitda and comparable earnings to evaluate the company’s operating performance we believe this information is also useful to investors as it provides insight into the earnings and cash flow criteria management uses to make strategic decisions ebit ebitda and net earnings are typically derived directly from the company’s statements of earnings however they may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods 

  

based on the above definitions our calculation of comparable ebit is summarized below 

  

   

our calculations of comparable ebitda the comparable ebit to interest ratio and the net debt to comparable ebitda ratio are summarized below 

  

   

a   debt amounts at december 31 2009 do not include amounts borrowed under the company’s offbalance sheet accounts receivable securitization program of 2500 million 

  

  

our calculation of comparable net earnings is summarized below 

  

   

commitments 

  

cash payments required for longterm debt maturities rental payments under noncancellable operating leases purchase obligations and other commitments in effect at december 31 2011 are summarized in the following table 

  

   

a   amounts reported in local currencies have been translated at yearend 2011 exchange rates 

b   for variable rate facilities amounts are based on interest rates in effect at year end and do not contemplate the effects of any hedging instruments utilized by the company 

c   the company’s purchase obligations include contracted amounts for aluminum steel and other direct materials also included are commitments for purchases of natural gas and electricity expenses related to aerospace and technologies contracts and other less significant items in cases where variable prices andor usage are involved management’s best estimates have been used depending on the circumstances early termination of the contracts may or may not result in penalties and therefore actual payments could vary significantly 

  

the table above does not include 688 million of uncertain tax positions the timing of which is unknown at this time 

  

contributions to the company’s defined benefit pension plans not including the unfunded german plans are expected to be in the range of 120 million in 2012 this estimate may change based on changes in the pension protection act and actual plan asset performance among other factors benefit payments related to these plans are expected to be 1137 million 766 million 802 million 842 million and 879 million for the years ending december 31 2012 through 2016 respectively and a total of 4967 million for the years 2017 through 2021 payments to participants in the unfunded german plans are expected to be between 21 million €16 million and 22 million €17 million in each of the years 2012 through 2016 and a total of 98 million €76 million for the years 2017 through 2021 

  

for the us pension plans in 2012 we revised our return on asset assumption to 775 percent from 800 percent in 2011 and our discount rate assumption to an average of 475 percent from 555 percent in 2011 based on these changes in assumptions and revisions based on plan experience studies us pension expense in 2012 is anticipated to be approximately 6 million higher than in 2011 taking into consideration higher pension funding in 2012 a further reduction of the expected return on us pension assets assumption by a quarter of a percentage point would result in an estimated 31 million increase in the 2012 global pension expense while a quarter of a percentage point reduction in the discount rate applied to the pension liability would result in an estimated 45 million of additional pension expense in 2012 additional information regarding the company’s pension plans is provided in note 14 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

  

  

due to the us tax status of certain of ball’s subsidiaries in canada and the prc the company annually provides us taxes on foreign earnings in those subsidiaries net of any estimated foreign tax credits in 2010 ball increased its economic interest in its brazilian joint venture and due to the nature of the investment ball provides deferred taxes on the portion of undistributed earnings of the brazil investment related to this incremental investment net us taxes provided for brazil canada and prc earnings in 2011 2010 and 2009 were 177 million 134 million and 166 million respectively for the foreseeable future anticipated cash flow from the us operations should be sufficient to meet the domestic operational needs including capital expenditures dividends share repurchases and debt service including minimal near term debt maturities over the next few years should domestic cash flow gaps arise due to unforeseen events ball can access funds in the us to bridge those gaps from its committed revolving credit facility from public bond markets from cash deposits in the prc on earnings for which us taxes have been provided and from repayment of outstanding us loans to foreign subsidiaries consequently management’s intention is to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of ball’s remaining foreign investments and as a result no us income or federal withholding tax provision has been made it is not practical to estimate the additional taxes that may become payable upon the eventual remittance of these foreign earnings however repatriation of these earnings would result in a relatively high incremental tax rate 

  

contingencies

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

financial instruments and risk management 

  

in the ordinary course of business we employ established risk management policies and procedures which seek to reduce ball’s exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices interest rates foreign currencies and prices of the company’s common stock and the company’s deferred compensation stock plan however there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be successful although the instruments utilized involve varying degrees of credit market and interest risk the counterparties to the agreements are expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements we monitor counterparty credit risk including lenders on a regular basis but we cannot be certain that all risks will be discerned or that its risk management policies and procedures will always be effective further details are available in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

  

we have estimated our market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis market risk exposure has been defined as the changes in fair value of derivative instruments financial instruments and commodity positions to test the sensitivity of our market risk exposure we have estimated the changes in fair value of market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in market prices or rates the results of the sensitivity analyses are summarized below 

  

commodity price risk 

  

aluminum 

  

we manage commodity price risk in connection with market price fluctuations of aluminum ingot through two different methods first we enter into container sales contracts that include aluminum ingotbased pricing terms that generally reflect the same price fluctuations included in commercial supply contracts for the purchase of aluminum products the terms include fixed floating or passthrough aluminum ingot component pricing second we generally use derivative instruments such as option and forward contracts as economic and cash flow hedges of commodity price risk where there is not an arrangement in the sales contract to match underlying purchase volumes and pricing with sales volumes and pricing 

  

steel 

  

most sales contracts involving our steel products either include provisions permitting us to pass through some or all steel cost changes incurred or they incorporate annually negotiated steel prices we anticipate at this time that we will be able to pass through the majority of the steel price changes that may occur in 2012 

  

considering the effects of derivative instruments the company’s ability to pass through certain raw material costs through contractual provisions the market’s ability to accept price increases and the company’s commodity price exposures under its contract terms a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the company’s steel and aluminum prices could result in an estimated 48 million aftertax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period additionally the company has currency exposures on raw materials and the effect of a 10 percent adverse change is included in the total currency exposure discussed below actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates 

  

the company is also exposed to fluctuations in prices for natural gas and electricity as well as the cost of diesel fuel as a component of freight cost a hypothetical 10 percent increase in our natural gas and electricity prices could result in an estimated 82 million aftertax reduction of net earnings over a oneyear period a hypothetical 10 percent increase in diesel fuel prices could result in an estimated 03 million aftertax reduction of net earnings over the same period actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates 

  

interest rate risk 

  

our objective in managing exposure to interest rate changes is to manage the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to minimize our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we may use a variety of interest rate swaps collars and options to manage our mix of floating and fixedrate debt interest rate instruments held by the company at december 31 2011 included payfixed interest rate swaps payfixed swaps effectively convert variable rate obligations to fixedrate instruments 

  

  

based on our interest rate exposure at december 31 2011 assumed floating rate debt levels throughout the next 12 months and the effects of derivative instruments a 100basis point increase in interest rates could result in an estimated 81 million aftertax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates and the timing of these changes 

  

currency exchange rate risk 

  

our objective in managing exposure to currency fluctuations is to limit the exposure of cash flows and earnings from changes associated with currency exchange rate changes through the use of various derivative contracts in addition at times ball manages earnings translation volatility through the use of currency option strategies and the change in the fair value of those options is recorded in the company’s net earnings our currency translation risk results from the currencies in which we transact business we face currency exposures in our global operations as a result of purchasing raw materials in us dollars and to a lesser extent in other currencies sales contracts are negotiated with customers to reflect cost changes and where there is not an exchange passthrough arrangement the company uses forward and option contracts to manage currency exposures 

  

considering the company’s derivative financial instruments outstanding at december 31 2011 and the currency exposures a hypothetical 10 percent reduction us dollar strengthening in currency exchange rates compared to the us dollar could result in an estimated 448 million aftertax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period this hypothetical adverse change in currency exchange rates would also reduce our forecasted average debt balance by 248 million actual changes in market prices or rates may differ from hypothetical changes 

  

common stock price risk 

  

the company’s deferred compensation stock program is subject to variable plan accounting and accordingly is marked to fair value using the company’s closing stock price at the end of a reporting period based on current share levels in the program each 1 change in the company’s stock price has an impact of 18 million on pretax earnings during march and september 2011 the company entered into total return swaps to mitigate the company’s exposure to these fair value fluctuations

our reporting segments 

since june 2010 with the announced sale of the company’s plastics packaging americas business ball corporation has had four reportable segments after aggregating the metal beverage packaging americas and asia segments based on similar economic and qualitative characteristics the four reportable segments are 1 metal beverage packaging americas and asia 2 metal beverage packaging europe 3 metal food and household products packaging americas and 4 aerospace and technologies ball also has investments in companies in the us and the prc which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and accordingly those results are not included in segment sales or earnings we previously accounted for our investment in a brazilian joint venture using the equity method of accounting however during august 2010 ball acquired an additional economic interest in the joint venture and its results since the acquisition date are consolidated and included in the metal beverage packaging americas and asia segment 

profitability is sensitive to selling prices production volumes labor transportation utility and warehousing costs as well as the availability and price of raw materials such as aluminum tinplate steel and other direct materials these raw materials are generally available from several sources and we have secured what we consider to be adequate supplies and are not experiencing any shortages there has been significant consolidation of raw material suppliers in both north america and in europe over the past several years raw materials and energy sources such as natural gas and electricity may from time to time be in short supply or unavailable due to external factors we cannot predict the timing or effects if any of such occurrences on future operations 

metal beverage packaging americas and asia segment 

metal beverage packaging americas and asia is ball’s largest segment accounting for 51 percent of consolidated net sales in 2010 metal beverage containers are primarily sold under multiyear supply contracts to fillers of carbonated soft drinks beer energy drinks and other beverages 

americas 

in august 2010 the company acquired an additional 101 percent economic interest in its brazilian metal beverage packaging joint venture latapackball embalagens ltda latapackball through a transaction with the joint venture partner latapack sa this transaction increased the company’s overall economic interest in the joint venture to 601 percent and resulted in ball becoming the primary beneficiary of the entity and consequently consolidating the joint venture 

metal beverage containers are produced at 17 manufacturing facilities in the us one in canada and two in brazil can ends are produced within four of the us facilities including two facilities that manufacture only can ends and one facility in brazil additionally rocky mountain metal container llc a 50percent investment owned by ball and millercoors llc operates metal beverage container and can end manufacturing facilities in golden colorado 

where growth is projected in certain markets or for certain products ball is undertaking selected capacity increases in its existing facilities and may establish or obtain additional manufacturing capacity to the extent required by the growth of any of the markets we serve in january 2011 we announced that we will close our torrance california plant relocate a line from the torrance plant to our whitby ontario plant and expand specialty can production in our fort worth texas plant in february 2011 we announced plans to construct a new metal beverage container manufacturing plant in northeast brazil which is one of the fastest growing regions of the country the new plant will be located in alagoinhas and is expected to start up in early 2012 the output from the first line has been contracted under a longterm agreement 

according to publicly available information and company estimates the combined us canadian and brazilian metal beverage container markets represent more than 117 billion units five companies manufacture substantially all of the metal beverage containers in the us and canada and three companies manufacture substantially all such containers in brazil two of these producers and three other independent producers also manufacture metal beverage containers in mexico ball produced in excess of 43 billion recyclable beverage containers in the us canada and brazil in 2010 – about 37 percent of the aggregate production for those markets sales volumes of metal beverage containers in north america tend to be highest during the period from april through september while in brazil sales volumes tend to be highest from september through december all of the beverage cans produced by ball in the us canada and brazil are made of aluminum as are almost all beverage cans produced by our competitors in those countries in 2010 we were able to recover substantially all aluminumrelated cost increases levied by sheet producers through either financial or contractual means in the americas segment five aluminum suppliers provide virtually all of our requirements

metal beverage containers are sold based on price quality service innovation and sustainability in a highly competitive market which is relatively capital intensive and is characterized by plants that run more or less continuously in order to operate profitably in addition the metal beverage container competes aggressively with other packaging materials the glass bottle has maintained a meaningful position in the packaged beer industry while the pet container has grown significantly in the carbonated soft drink and water industries over the past quarter century 

we believe we have limited our exposure related to changes in the costs of aluminum ingot as a result of the inclusion of provisions in most metal beverage container sales contracts to pass through aluminum ingot price changes as well as through the use of derivative instruments 

asia 

the metal beverage container market in the prc is approximately 15 billion containers of which ball’s operations represent an estimated 31 percent our percentage of the industry makes us one of the largest manufacturers of metal beverage containers in the prc eight other manufacturers account for the remainder of the production our operations include the manufacture of aluminum cans and ends in four plants in the prc as well as in a joint venture we also manufacture and sell highdensity plastic containers in two prc plants primarily servicing the motor oil industry 

in june 2010 the company acquired guangdong jianlibao group co ltd’s 65 percent interest in a joint venture metal beverage can and end plant in sanshui foshan prc ball had owned 35 percent of the joint venture plant since 1992 ball acquired the 65 percent interest for 869 million in cash net of cash acquired and assumed debt and also entered into a longterm beverage can supply agreement with jianlibao and one of its affiliates 

metal beverage packaging europe segment 

the european metal beverage container market excluding russia is approximately 51 billion containers and ball packaging europe is the second largest producer with an estimated 32 percent of european shipments while the european market is highly regional in terms of sales growth rates and packaging mix it is showing signs of general improvement and is expected to return to historical growth trends following the impacts of the global economic downturn in germany over the past year two discounters relisted beverage cans on their shelves continuing the redevelopment of the german beverage can market during 2010 the company decided not to place into operations a plant in lublin poland and will instead install the can line originally intended for lublin in its belgrade serbia plant 

sales volumes of metal beverage containers in europe tend to be highest during the period from may through august with a smaller increase in demand leading up to the winter holiday season in the united kingdom as in north america the metal beverage container competes aggressively with other packaging materials used by the european beer and carbonated soft drink industries the glass bottle is heavily utilized in the packaged beer industry while the pet container is utilized in the carbonated soft drink beer juice and mineral water industries 

the metal beverage packaging europe segment which accounted for 22 percent of ball’s consolidated net sales in 2010 supplies twopiece metal beverage containers and ends for producers of carbonated soft drinks beer mineral water fruit juices energy drinks and other beverages the european operations consist of 12 plants – 10 beverage container plants and two beverage end plants – of which four are located in germany three in the united kingdom two in france and one each in the netherlands poland and serbia in addition ball packaging europe is currently renting additional space on the premises of a supplier in haslach germany in order to   produce   the ball resealable   end bre   the   european plants   produced   approximately 16 billion cans in 2010 with approximately 58 percent of those being produced from aluminum and 42 percent from steel six of the container plants use aluminum and four use steel 

in january 2011 ball completed the acquisition of aerocan sas aerocan a leading european supplier of aluminum aerosol containers for €2224 million approximately 300 million in cash and assumed debt aerocan manufactures aluminum aerosol containers and the aluminum slugs used to make them for customers in the personal care pharmaceutical beverage and food industries it operates three aerosol container manufacturing plants – one each in the czech republic france and the united kingdom – and is a 51 percent owner of a joint venture aluminum slug plant in france the four plants employ approximately 560 people the acquisition of aerocan allows ball to enter a growing part of the metal packaging industry and to broaden the company’s market development efforts into a new customer base

european raw material supply contracts are generally for a period of one year although ball packaging europe has negotiated some longer term agreements in europe three steel suppliers and four aluminum suppliers provide approximately 95 percent of our requirements aluminum is traded primarily in us dollars while the functional currencies of ball packaging europe and its subsidiaries are nonus dollars the company generally tries to minimize the resulting foreign exchange rate risk using derivative and supply contracts in local currencies in addition purchase and sales contracts generally include fixed price floating and passthrough pricing arrangements 

metal food  household products packaging americas segment 

the metal food and household products packaging americas segment accounted for 18 percent of consolidated net sales in 2010 ball produces twopiece and threepiece steel food containers and ends for packaging vegetables fruit soups meat seafood nutritional products pet food and other products the segment also manufactures and sells aerosol paint and general line containers as well as decorative specialty containers and aluminum slugs there are a total of 15 plants in the us and canada that produce these products in addition the company manufactures and sells aerosol containers in two plants in argentina 

sales volumes of metal food containers in north america tend to be highest from may through october as a result of seasonal fruit vegetable and salmon packs we estimate our 2010 shipments of more than 5 billion steel food containers to be approximately 18 percent of total us and canadian metal food container shipments we estimate our aerosol business accounts for approximately 49 percent of total annual us and canadian steel aerosol shipments we are the leading supplier of aluminum slugs in the us and canada and estimate our percentage of total industry shipments to be approximately 98 percent 

competitors in the metal food container product line include two national and a small number of regional suppliers and self manufacturers several producers in mexico also manufacture steel food containers competition in the us steel aerosol container market primarily includes three other national suppliers steel containers also compete with other packaging materials in the food and household products industry including glass aluminum plastic paper and the standup pouch as a result profitability for this product line is dependent on price cost reduction service and quality in north america two steel suppliers provide nearly 65 percent of our tinplate steel we believe we have limited our exposure related to changes in the costs of steel tinplate and aluminum as a result of the inclusion of provisions in many sales contracts to pass through steel and aluminum cost changes and the existence of certain other steel container sales contracts that incorporate annually negotiated metal costs in 2010 we were able to pass through the majority of steel cost increases levied by producers 

cost containment is crucial to maintaining profitability in the food and aerosol container manufacturing industries and ball is focused on doing so toward that end in september 2010 ball announced the closure of its metal food container manufacturing plant in richmond british columbia and during 2008 and 2009 ball closed its aerosol container manufacturing plants in tallapoosa georgia and commerce california the two aerosol plant closures resulted in a net reduction in manufacturing capacity of 10 production lines including the relocation of two highspeed aerosol lines to other existing ball facilities and allowed us to supply customers from a more consolidated asset base 

aerospace and technologies segment 

ball’s aerospace and technologies segment which accounted for 9 percent of consolidated net sales in 2010 includes national defense hardware antenna and video component technologies civil and operational space hardware and systems engineering services the segment develops spacecraft sensors and instruments radio frequency systems and other advanced technologies for the civil commercial and national security aerospace markets the majority of the aerospace and technologies business involves work under contracts generally from one to five years in duration as a prime contractor or subcontractor for the us department of defense dod the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and other us government agencies contracts funded by the various agencies of the federal government represented 96 percent of segment sales in 2010 

geopolitical events and shifting executive and legislative branch priorities have resulted in an increase in opportunities over the past decade in areas matching our aerospace and technologies segment’s core capabilities in space hardware in 2010 we have seen an increase in space hardware orders our traditional strength combined with continued growth in opportunities related to our information services and tactical components uncertainties in the federal government budgeting process could delay the funding or even result in cancellation of certain programs currently in our reported backlog the businesses include hardware software and services sold primarily to us customers with emphasis on space science and exploration environmental and earth sciences and defense and intelligence applications major contractual activities frequently involve the design manufacture and testing of satellites remote sensors and ground station control hardware and software as well as related services such as launch vehicle integration and satellite operations 

page 4 of 100 

  

  

  

other hardware activities include target identification warning and attitude control systems and components cryogenic systems for reactant storage and associated sensor cooling devices star trackers which are generalpurpose stellar attitude sensors and faststeering mirrors additionally the aerospace and technologies segment provides diversified technical services and products to government agencies prime contractors and commercial organizations for a broad range of information warfare electronic warfare avionics intelligence training and space systems needs 

backlog in the aerospace and technologies segment was 989 million and 518 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively and consisted of the aggregate contract value of firm orders excluding amounts previously recognized as revenue the increase in backlog is primarily due to the previously announced awards of the worldview3 and joint polar satellite system jpss contracts the 2010 backlog includes 521 million expected to be recognized in revenues during 2011 with the remainder expected to be recognized in revenues thereafter unfunded amounts included in backlog for certain firm government orders which are subject to annual funding were 620 million and 261 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively yearoveryear comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations 

discontinued operations – plastic packaging americas 

in august 2010 we completed the sale of our plastics packaging business and received gross proceeds of 280 million this amount included 15 million of contingent consideration recognized at closing but did not include preliminary closing adjustments totaling 185 million paid in the fourth quarter the sale of our plastics packaging business included five us plants that manufactured polyethylene terephthalate   pet bottles and preforms and polypropylene bottles as well as associated customer contracts and other related assets and liabilities 

our plastics business employed approximately 1000 people and had manufacturing plants located in ames iowa batavia illinois bellevue ohio chino california and delran new jersey the research and development operations were based in broomfield and westminster colorado 

patents 

in the opinion of the company none of its active patents is essential to the successful operation of its business as a whole 

research and development 

research and development rd efforts in our packaging segments are primarily directed toward packaging innovation specifically the development of new features sizes shapes and types of containers as well as new uses for existing containers other rd efforts in these segments seek to improve manufacturing efficiencies and the overall sustainability of our products our north american packaging rd activities are primarily conducted in the ball technology  innovation center btic located in westminster colorado the european rd activities are primarily conducted in a technical center located in bonn germany 

in our aerospace business we continue to focus our rd activities on the design development and manufacture of innovative aerospace products and systems this includes the production of spacecraft instruments and sensors radio frequency and system components data exploitation solutions and a variety of advanced aerospace technologies and products that enable deep space missions our aerospace rd activities are conducted at various locations in the us 

additional information regarding company rd activity is contained in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report as well as included in item 2 “properties” 

sustainability and the environment 

throughout our company’s history we have focused on our economic social and environmental sustainability in all aspects of our businesses we continue to make progress on the sustainability goals stated in our second sustainability report issued in june 2010 

key issues for our company include reducing our use of electricity and natural gas reducing waste and increasing recycling at our facilities analyzing and reducing our water consumption reducing our existing volatile organic compounds and further improving safety performance in our facilities 

page 5 of 100 

  

  

  

the 2009 recycling rate in the us for aluminum cans was 57 percent the highest recycling rate for any beverage container the 2009 us recycling rate for steel cans was 66 percent according to the most recently published data in north america the aluminum can sheet we buy contains an average of 68 percent total recycled content and the average total recycled content for steel sheet is 33 percent 

recycling rates vary throughout europe but average around 63 percent for aluminum containers and 70 percent for steel containers which exceeds the european union’s goal of 50 percent recycling for metals due in part to the intrinsic value of aluminum and steel metal packaging recycling rates in europe compare favorably to those of other packaging materials ball’s european operations help establish and financially support recycling initiatives in growing markets such as poland and serbia to educate consumers about the benefits of recycling aluminum and steel containers and to increase recycling rates we have initiated a similar program in the prc to educate consumers in that market regarding the benefits of recycling 

compliance with federal state and local laws relating to protection of the environment has not had a material adverse effect upon the capital expenditures earnings or competitive position of the company as more fully described in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report on form 10k the us environmental protection agency and various state environmental agencies have designated the company as a potentially responsible party along with numerous other companies for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites however the company’s information at this time indicates that these matters will not have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity results of operations or financial condition of the company 

legislation that would prohibit tax or restrict the sale or use of certain types of containers or would require diversion of solid wastes including packaging materials from disposal in landfills has been or may be introduced anywhere we operate while deposit systems and other containerrelated legislation has been adopted in some jurisdictions similar legislation has been defeated in public referenda and legislative bodies in many others the company anticipates that continuing efforts will be made to consider and adopt such legislation in the future if such legislation were widely adopted it could potentially have a material adverse effect on the business of the company including its liquidity results of operations or financial condition as well as on the packaging industry generally in view of the company’s substantial global sales and investment in metal container manufacturing however the packages we produce are widely used and perform well in us states canadian provinces and european countries that have deposit systems 

employee relations 

at the end of 2010 the company and its subsidiaries employed approximately 8900 employees in the us and 5100 in other countries further details of collective bargaining agreements are included within item 1a risk factors of this annual report

 item 1a risk factors 

any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our business operating results and financial condition are subject to particular risks in certain regions of the world 

we may experience an operating loss in one or more regions of the world for one or more periods which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition moreover overcapacity which often leads to lower prices exists in a number of the regions in which we operate and may persist even if demand grows our ability to manage such operational fluctuations and to maintain adequate longterm strategies in the face of such developments will be critical to our continued growth and profitability 

there can be no assurance that the company’s business acquisitions will be successfully integrated into the acquiring company see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report for details of acquisitions made during the three years ended december 31 2010 as well as note 23 for an acquisition completed in january 2011 

while we have what we believe to be well designed integration plans if we cannot successfully integrate the acquired operations with those of ball we may experience material negative consequences to our business financial condition or results of operations the integration of companies that have previously been operated separately involves a number of risks including but not limited to 

 

we may not be able to achieve potential synergies or maintain the levels of revenue earnings or operating efficiency that each business had achieved or might achieve separately the successful integration of the acquired operations will depend on our ability to manage those operations realize revenue opportunities and to some degree eliminate redundant and excess costs 

the loss of a key customer or a reduction in its requirements could have a significant negative impact on our sales 

we sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major beverage packaged food and household product companies some of which operate in north america south america europe and asia 

although the majority of our customer contracts are longterm these contracts are terminable under certain circumstances such as our failure to meet quality volume or market pricing requirements because we depend on relatively few major customers our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss of any of these customers a reduction in the purchasing levels of these customers a strike or work stoppage by a significant number of these customers’ employees or an adverse change in the terms of the supply agreements with these customers 

the primary customers for our aerospace segment are us government agencies or their prime contractors our contracts with these customers are subject to several risks including funding cuts and delays technical uncertainties budget changes competitive activity and changes in scope 

page 7 of 100 

  

  

  

we face competitive risks from many sources that may negatively impact our profitability 

competition within the packaging and aerospace industries is intense increases in productivity combined with existing or potential surplus capacity in the industry have maintained competitive pricing pressures the principal methods of competition in the general packaging industry are price service and quality and in the aerospace industry are technical capability cost and schedule some of our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources and some may currently have significant excess capacity our current or potential competitors may offer products at a lower price or products that are deemed superior to ours the global economic environment has resulted in reductions in demand for our products in some instances which in turn could increase these competitive pressures 

we are subject to competition from alternative products which could result in lower profits and reduced cash flows 

our metal packaging products are subject to significant competition from substitute products particularly plastic carbonated soft drink bottles made from pet single serve beer bottles and other food and beverage containers made of glass cardboard or other materials competition from plastic carbonated soft drink bottles is particularly intense in the us the united kingdom and the prc certain of our aerospace products are also subject to competition from alternative products and solutions there can be no assurance that our products will successfully compete against alternative products which could result in a reduction in our profits or cash flow 

our packaging businesses have a narrow product range and our business would suffer if usage of our products decreased 

for the 12 months ended december 31 2010 73 percent of our consolidated net sales were from the sale of metal beverage containers and we expect to derive a significant portion of our future revenues and cash flows from the sale of metal beverage containers our business would suffer if the use of metal beverage containers decreased accordingly broad acceptance by consumers of aluminum and steel containers for a wide variety of beverages is critical to our future success if demand for glass and pet bottles increases relative to metal containers or the demand for aluminum and steel containers does not develop as expected our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

changes in laws and governmental regulations may adversely affect our business and operations 

we and our customers and suppliers are subject to various federal state and provincial laws and regulations each of our and their plants is subject to federal state provincial and local licensing and regulation by health environmental workplace safety and other agencies in multiple jurisdictions requirements of governmental authorities with respect to manufacturing manufacturing plant locations within the jurisdiction product content and safety climate change workplace safety and health environmental expropriation of assets and other standards could adversely affect our ability to manufacture or sell our products and the ability of our customers and suppliers to manufacture and sell their products in addition we face risks arising from compliance with and enforcement of increasingly numerous and complex federal state and provincial laws and regulations 

significant environmental employmentrelated and other legislation and regulatory requirements exist and are also evolving the compliance costs associated with current and proposed laws and potential regulations could be substantial and any failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws or regulations could lead to litigation or governmental action all of which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

our business financial condition and results of operations are subject to risks resulting from broader geographic operations 

we derived approximately 32 percent of our consolidated net sales from outside of the us for the year ended december 31 2010 this sizeable scope of international operations may lead to more volatile financial results and make it more difficult for us to manage our business reasons for this include but are not limited to the following 

 

page 8 of 100 

  

  

  

any of these factors some of which are also present in the us could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations 

our reporting currency is the us dollar historically a portion of ball’s operations including assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses have been denominated in various currencies other than the us dollar and we expect such operations will continue to be so denominated as a result the us dollar value of these operations has varied and will continue to vary with exchange rate fluctuations ball has been and is presently primarily exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate of the euro british pound canadian dollar polish zloty chinese renminbi and the brazilian real we are also exposed to a lesser extent to fluctuations in the argentine peso serbian dinar and czech koruna 

a decrease in the value of any of these currencies compared to the us dollar could reduce our profits from these operations and the value of their net assets when reported in us dollars in our financial statements this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations as reported in us dollars in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to currencies in which the earnings are generated may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations 

we manage our exposure to currency fluctuations particularly our exposure to fluctuations in the euro to us dollar exchange rate in order to attempt to mitigate the effect of cash flow and earnings volatility associated with exchange rate changes we primarily use forward contracts and options to manage our currency exposures and as a result we experience gains and losses on these derivative positions offset in part by the impact of currency fluctuations on existing assets and liabilities our inability to properly manage our exposure to currency fluctuations could materially impact our results 

if we fail to retain key management and personnel we may be unable to implement our key objectives 

we believe that our future success depends in part on our experienced management team unforeseen losses of key members of our management team without appropriate succession planning could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet our objectives 

decreases in our ability to apply new technology and knowhow may affect our competitiveness 

our success depends partially on our ability to improve production processes and services we must also introduce new products and services to meet changing customer needs if we are unable to implement better production processes or to develop new products we may not be able to remain competitive with other manufacturers as a result our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

adverse weather and climate changes may result in lower sales 

we manufacture packaging products primarily for beverages and foods unseasonably cool weather can reduce demand for certain beverages packaged in our containers in addition poor weather conditions or changes in climate that reduce crop yields of fruits and vegetables can adversely affect demand for our food containers climate change could have various effects on the demand for our products in different regions around the world 

we are vulnerable to fluctuations in the supply and price of raw materials 

we purchase aluminum steel and other raw materials and packaging supplies from several sources while all such materials are available from independent suppliers raw materials are subject to fluctuations in price and availability attributable to a number of factors including general economic conditions commodity price fluctuations particularly aluminum on the london metal exchange the demand by other industries for the same raw materials and the availability of complementary and substitute materials although we enter into commodities purchase agreements from time to time and sometimes use derivative instruments to seek to manage our risk we cannot ensure that our current suppliers of raw materials will be able to supply us with sufficient quantities at reasonable prices economic and financial factors could impact our suppliers thereby causing supply shortages increases in raw material costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in the americas europe and asia some contracts do not allow us to pass along increased raw material costs and we generally use derivative agreements to seek to manage this risk our hedging procedures may be insufficient and our results could be materially impacted if costs of materials increase due to the fixed price contracts and derivative activities while increasing raw material costs may not impact our nearterm profitability increased prices could decrease our sales volume over time 

page 9 of 100 

  

  

  

prolonged work stoppages at plants with union employees could jeopardize our financial position 

as of december 31 2010 approximately 50 percent of our approximately 4700 north american packaging plant employees and approximately 85 percent of our european packaging plant employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements these collective bargaining agreements have staggered expirations during the next several years although we consider our employee relations to be generally good a prolonged work stoppage or strike at any facility with union employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition we cannot ensure that upon the expiration of existing collective bargaining agreements new agreements will be reached without union action or that any such new agreements will be on terms satisfactory to us 

our aerospace and technologies segment is subject to certain risks specific to that business including those outlined below 

in our aerospace business us government contracts are subject to reduction or modification in the event of changes in requirements or budgetary constraints and the government may also terminate contracts at its convenience pursuant to standard termination provisions in such instances ball may be entitled to reimbursement for allowable cost and profits on authorized work that has been performed through the date of termination 

our backlog includes both costtype and fixedprice contracts costtype contracts generally have lower profit margins than fixedprice contracts our earnings and margins may vary depending on the types of government contracts undertaken the nature of the work performed under those contracts the costs incurred in performing the work the achievement of other performance objectives and their impact on our ability to receive fees 

our business is subject to substantial environmental remediation and compliance costs 

our operations are subject to federal state provincial and local laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions relating to environmental hazards such as emissions to air discharges to water the handling and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes and the cleanup of hazardous substances the us environmental protection agency has designated us along with numerous other companies as a potentially responsible party for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites based on available information we do not believe that any costs incurred in connection with such sites will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations capital expenditures or competitive position there is increased focus on the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental issues worldwide 

net earnings and net worth could be materially affected by an impairment of goodwill 

we have a significant amount of goodwill recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2010 we are required at least annually to test the recoverability of goodwill the recoverability test of goodwill is based on the current fair value of our identified reporting units fair value measurement requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors including revenue and market growth operating cash flows and discount rates if general market conditions deteriorate in portions of our business we could experience a significant decline in the fair value of reporting units this decline could lead to an impairment of all or a significant portion of the goodwill balance which could materially affect our us gaap net earnings and net worth 

if the investments in ball’s pension plans do not perform as expected we may have to contribute additional amounts to the plans which would otherwise be available to cover operating expenses and fund growth opportunities 

ball maintains defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of its north american and united kingdom employees which are funded based on certain actuarial assumptions the plans’ assets consist primarily of common stocks fixed income securities and in the us alternative investments market declines longevity increases or legislative changes such as the pension protection act in the us could result in a prospective decrease in our available cash flow and net earnings over time and the recognition of an increase in our pension obligations could result in a reduction to our shareholders’ equity 

page 10 of 100 

  

  

  

restricted access to capital markets could adversely affect our shortterm liquidity and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the notes issued pursuant to our bond indentures 

on december 31 2010 we had total debt of 28 billion and unused committed credit lines of approximately 1 billion a reduction of financial liquidity could have important consequences including the following 

 

in addition more than onethird of our debt bears interest at variable rates if market interest rates increase variablerate debt will create higher debt service requirements which would adversely affect our cash flow while we sometimes enter into agreements limiting our exposure any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk 

changes in us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap and securities and exchange commission sec rules and regulations could materially impact our reported results 

us gaap and sec accounting and reporting changes are common and have become more frequent and significant over the past several years furthermore the us and international accounting standard setters are in the process of jointly converging accounting standards these changes could have significant effects on our reported results when compared to prior periods and other companies and may even require us to retrospectively adjust prior periods additionally material changes to the presentation of transactions in the consolidated financial statements could impact key ratios that analysts and credit rating agencies use to rate ball the material changes in net earnings andor presentation of transactions could impact our credit rating and ultimately our ability to access the credit markets in an efficient manner 

the global credit financial and economic environment could have a negative impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

management’s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in item 8 of this report which include additional information about our accounting policies practices and the transactions underlying our financial results the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes including various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits taxes environmental and other matters arising during the normal course of business we apply our best judgment our knowledge of existing facts and circumstances and actions that we may undertake in the future in determining the estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances such as current economic conditions and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change as future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision actual results may differ from these estimates ball corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as “ball corporation” “ball” “the company” or “we” or “our” in the following discussion and analysis 

overview 

business overview 

ball corporation is one of the world’s leading suppliers of metal packaging to the beverage food and household products industries our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses and are manufactured in plants around the world we also provide aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers 

we sell our packaging products primarily to major beverage food and household products companies with which we have developed longterm customer relationships this is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of longterm supply contracts while we have a diversified customer base we sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major companies in north america europe the people’s republic of china prc brazil and argentina as do our equity joint ventures in the us and the prc we also purchase raw materials from relatively few suppliers because of our customer and supplier concentration our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss insolvency or bankruptcy of a major customer or supplier or a change in a supply agreement with a major customer or supplier although our contracts and longterm relationships generally mitigate the risk of customer loss we are also subject to exposure from inflation and the rising costs of raw materials as well as other inputs into our direct costs we reduce our risk to these exposures either by fixing our material costs through derivative contracts or by including provisions in our sales contracts to recover the increases from our customers 

industry trends and corporate strategy 

in the rigid packaging industry sales and earnings can be improved by reducing costs increasing prices developing new products expanding volumes and making strategic acquisitions over the past two years we have closed a number of packaging facilities in support of our ongoing objective of matching our supply with market demand we have also identified and implemented plans to improve our return on invested capital through the redeployment of assets within our operations to better realign capacity we announced in 2010 the closure of our richmond british columbia plant and decided not to place into operations a plant in lublin poland in january 2011 we also announced that we will close our torrance california plant and relocate a line from the torrance plant to our whitby ontario plant 

as part of our packaging strategy we are focused on developing and marketing new and existing products that meet the needs of our customers and the ultimate consumer these innovations include new shapes sizes opening features and other functional benefits this ongoing packaging development activity helps us maintain and expand our supply positions with major beverage food and household products customers

while the north american metal beverage container manufacturing industry is relatively mature the metal beverage container markets in other parts of the world are growing and are expected to continue to grow in the medium to long term we have been able to capitalize on growth by adding a plant as well as additional capacity in our consolidated brazilian joint venture and by increasing capacity in some of our european metal beverage container manufacturing facilities by speeding up certain lines and by expansion in october 2010 we announced that we are expanding production of our lightweight alumitek® bottle in our golden colorado facility and in january 2011 we announced that we will commence specialty can production in our fort worth texas plant in february 2011 we announced plans to construct a new metal beverage container manufacturing plant in northeast brazil which is one of the fastest growing regions of the country the new plant will be located in alagoinhas and is expected to start up in early 2012 the output from the first line has been contracted under a longterm agreement 

  

in july 2010 we entered the aluminum slug market by acquiring a leading north american manufacturer of aluminum slugs used to make extruded aerosol cans beverage bottles aluminum collapsible tubes and technical impact extrusions to further capitalize on this new product line in january 2011 we 

completed the acquisition of a leading european supplier of aluminum aerosol cans and bottles and the aluminum slugs used to make them 

ball’s consolidated earnings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and we attempt to mitigate this exposure through the use of derivative financial instruments as discussed in “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” within item 7a of this report 

the primary customers for the products and services provided by our aerospace and technologies segment are us government agencies or their prime contractors federal budget reductions and priorities or changes in agency budgets could limit future funding and new contract awards or delay or prolong contract performance 

we recognize sales under longterm contracts in the aerospace and technologies segment using the costtocost percentage of completion method of accounting the 2010 contract mix consisted of approximately twothirds costtype contracts which are billed at our costs plus an agreed upon andor earned profit component and approximately 25 percent fixedprice contracts the remainder represents time and material contracts which typically provide for the sale of engineering labor at fixed hourly rates the backlog at december 31 2010 of 989 million consists of approximately 45 percent fixed price contracts indicating a trend towards more fixed price business 

throughout the period of contract performance we regularly reevaluate and if necessary revise our estimates of ball aerospace  technologies corp’s total contract revenue total contract cost and progress toward completion because of contract payment schedules limitations on funding and other contract terms our sales and accounts receivable for this segment include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed 

management performance measures 

management uses various measures to evaluate company performance such as earnings before interest and taxes ebit earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda diluted earnings per share cash flow from operating activities free cash flow generally defined by the company as cash flow from operating activities less additions to property plant and equipment and economic value added net operating earnings after tax as defined by the company less a capital charge on net operating assets employed these financial measures may be adjusted at times for items that affect comparability between periods such as business consolidation costs and gains or losses on acquisitions and dispositions nonfinancial measures in the packaging businesses include production efficiency and spoilage rates quality control figures environmental health and safety statistics production and sales volumes asset utilization rates and measures of sustainability additional measures used to evaluate financial performance in the aerospace and technologies segment include contract revenue realization award and incentive fees realized proposal win rates and backlog including awarded contracted and funded backlog 

we recognize that attracting developing and retaining highly talented employees are essential to the success of ball and because of that we strive to pay employees competitively and encourage their ownership of the company’s common stock as part of a diversified portfolio for most management employees a meaningful portion of compensation is at risk as an incentive dependent upon economic value added operating performance for more senior positions more compensation is at risk through economic value added performance and various longterm cash and stock compensation plans through our employee stock purchase plan and 401k plan which matches employee contributions with ball common stock employees regardless of organizational level have opportunities to own ball stock

results of operations 

consolidated sales and earnings 

 

during 2010 we increased our investments in the growing brazilian and prc markets initiated the consolidation of our salmon can production capacity acquired a metal packagingrelated business in north america to expand our product portfolio and were awarded significant new contracts in our aerospace business in january 2011 we completed the acquisition of a metal packaging business in europe and announced plans to realign capacity in the us and canada by closing a beverage container manufacturing plant in california relocating a 12ounce can production line to a canadian plant and expanding specialty can production in a texas plant 

higher sales in 2010 were due largely to sales associated with current and prior year acquisitions and the consolidation of two joint ventures formerly accounted for as equity investments the higher net earnings from continuing operations included 1059 million of gains associated with the fair value on the previous equity investments due to the required purchase accounting 

effective june 2010 with the announced sale of the company’s plastics packaging americas business the company has four reportable segments after aggregating the metal beverage packaging americas and asia segments based on similar economic and qualitative characteristics the four reportable segments are 1 metal beverage packaging americas and asia 2 metal beverage packaging europe 3 metal food and household products packaging americas and 4 aerospace and technologies we also have investments in companies in the us and the prc which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and accordingly those results are not included in segment sales or earnings 

business segment discussions 

metal beverage packaging americas and asia 

 

 

the metal beverage packaging americas and asia segment consists of operations located in the us canada puerto rico through fiscal year 2008 brazil since august 2010 and the prc which manufacture metal container products used in beverage packaging as well as nonbeverage plastic containers manufactured and sold in the prc ball’s acquisition of the remaining 65 percent interest in a joint venture metal beverage can and end plant in sanshui foshan prc jfp was completed in june 2010 in august 2010 we acquired an additional economic interest in our brazilian joint venture latapackball and its results since the date of acquisition are consolidated and included in the metal beverage packaging americas segment as of that time in october 2009 ball acquired three metal beverage can manufacturing plants and one beverage can end manufacturing plant from anheuserbusch inbev nvsa ab inbev the acquisitions are discussed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report 

segment sales in 2010 as compared to 2009 were 9598 million higher primarily due to the four plants acquired from ab inbev additional sales associated with jfp and the consolidation of the latapackball joint venture 

page 19 of 100 

  

  

  

segment sales were 1007 million lower in 2009 than in 2008 primarily as a result of the impact of lower aluminum prices partially offset by an increase in sales volumes the higher sales volumes in 2009 were the result of incremental volumes from the four plants purchased from ab inbev partially offset by certain plant closures and lower sales volumes in the existing business 

segment earnings in 2010 were 1223 million higher than in 2009 primarily due to a net 85 million impact related to the higher sales volumes and 45 million of product mix and improved manufacturing performance associated with higher production also adding to the 2010 improvement was the effect of a 7 million outofperiod inventory charge in 2009 the details of the outofperiod adjustment are included in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included within item 8 of this report 

segment earnings in 2009 were higher than in 2008 due to 12 million of earnings contribution from the four acquired plants and approximately 21 million of savings associated with plant closures partially offsetting these favorable impacts were lower carbonated soft drink and beer can sales volumes excluding the newly acquired plants and approximately 25 million related to higher cost inventories in the first half of 2009 

metal beverage packaging europe 

 

 

the metal beverage packaging europe segment includes metal beverage packaging products manufactured in europe ball packaging europe has manufacturing plants located in germany the united kingdom france the netherlands poland and serbia and is the second largest metal beverage container business in europe 

segment sales in 2010 decreased 419 million compared to 2009 primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange effects of 93 million and price and mix changes partially offset by higher sales volumes segment sales in 2009 as compared to 2008 were 1292 million lower due to 110 million of unfavorable foreign exchange effects partially offset by better commercial terms sales volumes in 2009 were essentially flat compared to those in the prior year 

segment earnings in 2010 decreased 19 million compared to 2009 primarily the result of a 28 million increase related to higher sales volumes offset by 18 million of negative effects from foreign currency translation and 12 million of higher inventory and other costs 

while 2009 sales volumes were consistent with the prior year the adverse effects of foreign currency translation both within europe and on the conversion of the euro to the us dollar reduced segment earnings by 8 million also contributing to lower segment earnings were higher cost inventory carried into 2009 and a change in sales mix partially offset by better commercial terms in some of our contracts 

on january 18 2011 ball acquired aerocan sas aerocan a leading european supplier of aluminum aerosol cans and bottles for €2224 million approximately 300 million in cash and assumed debt aerocan manufactures extruded aluminum aerosol cans and bottles and the aluminum slugs used to make them for customers in the personal care pharmaceutical beverage and food industries it operates three aerosol can manufacturing plants – one each in the czech republic france and the united kingdom – and is a 51 percent owner of a joint venture aluminum slug plant in france the four plants employ approximately 560 people the acquisition of aerocan will allow ball to enter a growing part of the metal packaging industry and to broaden the company’s market development efforts into a new customer base

metal food and household products packaging americas 

 

 

the metal food and household products packaging americas segment consists of operations located in the us canada and argentina that manufacture and sell metal food aerosol paint and general line containers as well as decorative specialty containers and aluminum slugs 

in july 2010 the company acquired neuman aluminum neuman for approximately 62 million in cash neuman is the leading north american manufacturer of aluminum slugs used to make extruded aerosol cans beverage bottles aluminum collapsible tubes and technical impact extrusions and is composed of two plants one in the us and one in canada that employ approximately 180 people 

segment sales in 2010 declined 228 million compared to 2009 largely the result of 88 million of lower commodity prices partially offset by the sales associated with the neuman plants 

segment sales in 2009 increased 1715 million over 2008 due to higher selling prices driven by higher raw material costs beginning in 2009 which were partially offset by an approximate 20 million decrease in sales volumes caused by the effects of the economic recession and ball’s decision to not pursue low margin business 

segment earnings in 2010 decreased 17 million compared to 2009 primarily due to 44 million of lower cost inventory carried into 2009 that did not occur in 2010 substantially offset by improved manufacturing and cost performance favorable product sales mix and the addition of the neuman plants 

segment earnings in 2009 were 627 million higher than in 2008 due primarily to the increased sales prices mentioned above coupled with 44 million of lower cost inventory carried into 2009 and 22 million of improvements in manufacturing performance partially offset by the lower sales volumes and a settlement gain of 7 million in 2008 not recurring in 2009 

aerospace and technologies 

 

 

the aerospace and technologies segment consists of the manufacture and sale of aerospace and other related products and the providing of services used primarily in the defense civil space and commercial space industries 

segment sales in 2010 as compared to the prior year increased by 245 million primarily due to increased scope on existing programs and new program starts including worldview3 and several large classified programs these increases were partially offset by the cancellation of the orion program and the completion of several large programs including kepler and worldview2 segment sales in 2009 were 8 percent lower than in 2008 driven by the delivery of several large spacecraft during 2009 

page 21 of 100 

  

  

  

in addition to worldview3 some of the segment’s other highprofile contracts include the james webb space telescope a successor to the hubble space telescope the joint polar satellite system the nextgeneration satellite weather monitoring system the global precipitation measurementmicrowave imager which will play an essential role in the earth’s weather and environmental forecasting and a number of antennas and sensors for the joint strike fighter 

segment earnings in 2010 as compared to 2009 increased by 84 million due to favorable fixedprice program performance and higher sales partially offset by the program reductions described above segment earnings in 2009 were down 148 million compared to 2008 primarily attributable to the winding down of several large programs and overall reduced program activity 

on february 15 2008 ball completed the sale of its shares in bsg to qinetiq pty ltd for approximately 105 million including cash sold of 18 million the subsidiary provided services to the australian department of defense and related government agencies after an adjustment for working capital items the sale resulted in a pretax gain of 71 million 

sales to the us government either directly as a prime contractor or indirectly as a subcontractor represented 96 percent of segment sales in 2010 94 percent in 2009 and 91 percent in 2008 contracted backlog for the aerospace and technologies segment at december 31 2010 and 2009 was 989 million and 518 million respectively the increase in backlog is primarily due to the awards of the worldview3 and joint polar satellite system jpss contracts comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations 

discontinued operations – plastic packaging americas 

in august 2010 we completed the sale of our plastics packaging business and received gross proceeds of 280 million this amount included 15 million of contingent consideration recognized at closing but did not include preliminary closing adjustments totaling 185 million paid in the fourth quarter the sale of our plastics packaging business included five us plants that manufactured polyethylene terephthalate   pet bottles and preforms and polypropylene bottles as well as associated customer contracts and other related assets 

our plastics business employed approximately 1000 people and had sales of 635 million in 2009 the manufacturing plants were located in ames iowa batavia illinois bellevue ohio chino california and delran new jersey the research and development operations were based in broomfield and westminster colorado 

the following table summarizes the operating results for the discontinued operations for the years ended december 31 

 

 

additional segment information

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative sga expenses were 3568 million 3090 million and 2594 million for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the increase in sga expenses in 2010 was primarily due to 26 million of higher employee compensation costs including incentive compensation and stockbased compensation costs including marktomarket adjustments for the company’s deferred compensation stock plans 15 million of nonrecurring gains in 2009 and 12 million of other higher costs partially offset by 5 million of lower bad debt expense 

the increases in sga expenses in 2009 compared to 2008 were the result of approximately 31 million of higher employee compensation costs including incentive compensation costs and higher stockbased compensation costs 13 million of gains in 2008 not recurring in 2009 including a 7 million claim settlement and 7 million of death benefit insurance proceeds and 8 million of unfavorable foreign currency exchange impacts these were offset by net favorable decreased costs of 12 million including lower receivables securitization fees legal expenses and research and development costs 

interest and taxes 

consolidated interest expense was 1582 million in 2010 1172 million in 2009 and 1377 million in 2008 interest expense in 2010 included 88 million for the call premium and write off of unamortized financing costs and unamortized issuance premiums related to the redemption of ball’s senior notes due december 2012 as well as the refinancing of the senior credit facilities in december 2010 the higher expense in 2010 was also due to higher levels of debt including the issuance of 700 million of senior notes in august 2009 and 500 million of senior notes in november 2010 the lower expense in 2009 was primarily due to lower interest rates on floating rate debt partially offset by additional interest associated with the issuance of the august 2009 senior notes 

based on current estimates the 2011 effective income tax rate is expected to be approximately 31 percent ball’s consolidated effective income tax rate for 2010 was 290 percent compared to 298 percent in 2009 and 321 percent in 2008 the tax rate for 2010 as compared to 2009 included the accrual of a net 8 million tax benefit due to a change in the tax status of a foreign investment a net 118 million benefit related to the refinancing of the company’s senior credit facilities and an increased us manufacturing tax benefit offset by a higher 2010 tax provision for uncertain tax positions and an 85 million tax benefit realized in 2009 on the sale of shares in a stock investment resulting from a basis difference 

the lower tax rate in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to a 4 million net increase in tax benefits as a result of a foreign tax settlement legislative changes and a release of a valuation allowance for a net operating loss carryforward an 85 million tax benefit from the sale of shares in a stock investment due to a higher tax basis and a favorable change of 11 million in the provision for uncertain tax positions due to tax settlements in several foreign jurisdictions these benefits were partially offset by an increase due to the change in our earnings mix to higher taxed jurisdictions lower research and development tax credits and a decrease in the benefit of lower tax rates in foreign tax jurisdictions coupled with increased withholding taxes 

results of equity affiliates 

in august 2010 ball acquired an additional 101 percent economic interest in its brazilian beverage packaging joint venture latapackball increasing the company’s overall economic ownership interest in the joint venture to 601 percent in connection with the acquisition of the additional interest in latapackball we recorded a gain of 818 million on the fair value of the previously held 50 percent equity ownership as a result of required purchase accounting 

in june 2010 we acquired jianlibao’s 65 percent interest in a joint venture metal beverage can and end plant in sanshui foshan prc we had owned 35 percent of the joint venture plant since 1992 we acquired the 65 percent interest for 869 million in cash net of cash acquired and assumed debt and also entered into a longterm supply agreement with jianlibao and one of its affiliates we recorded equity earnings of 241 million which was composed of equity earnings and a gain realized on the fair value of ball’s previous 35 percent equity investment as a result of required purchase accounting

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows and capital expenditures 

liquidity 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities and external committed borrowings we believe that cash flows from operations and cash provided by shortterm and committed revolver borrowings when necessary will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements scheduled principal and interest payments on debt dividend payments and anticipated capital expenditures the following summarizes our cash flows 

 

cash flows provided by operating activities in 2010 included a use of 250 million related to a change in accounting for our accounts receivable securitization program at december 31 2009 the amount of accounts receivable sold under the securitization program was 250 million and under the previous accounting guidance this amount was presented in the consolidated balance sheet as a reduction of accounts receivable as a result of the true sale of receivables however upon the company’s adoption of new prospective accounting guidance effective january 1 2010 the amount of accounts receivable sold is not reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable on the balance sheet at december 31 2010 resulting in a 250 million increase in accounts receivable and a corresponding working capital outflow from operating activities in the statement of cash flows there were no accounts receivable sold under the securitization program at december 31 2010 

excluding the 250 million impact of additional accounts receivable from the change in accounting discussed above cash flows provided by operations were 7652 million in 2010 compared to 5597 million in 2009 and 6276 million in 2008 the significant improvement in 2010 was primarily due to higher earnings and favorable working capital changes partially offset by higher pension funding lower operating cash flows in 2009 compared to 2008 were the result of working capital increases and higher pension funding and income tax payments during the year offset by the payment of approximately 70 million to a customer for a legal settlement 

management performance measures 

the following financial measurements are on a nonus gaap basis and should be considered in connection with the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report nonus gaap measures should not be considered in isolation and should not be considered superior to or a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with us gaap a presentation of earnings in accordance with us gaap is available in item 8 of this report 

free cash flow 

management internally uses a free cash flow measure 1 to evaluate the company’s operating results 2 to plan stock buyback levels 3 to evaluate strategic investments and 4 to evaluate the company’s ability to incur and service debt free cash flow is not a defined term under us gaap and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures the company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less additions to property plant and equipment capital spending free cash flow is typically derived directly from the company’s cash flow statements however it may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods 

page 24 of 100 

  

  

  

based on the above definition our consolidated free cash flow is summarized as follows 

  

 

based on information currently available we estimate cash flows from operating activities for 2011 to be in excess of 900 million capital spending to be approximately 500 million and free cash flow to be more than 400 million in 2011 we intend to utilize our operating cash flow to continuing our stock repurchases and funding our capital spending programs 

adjusted ebit adjusted net earnings adjusted ebitda and ratios 

management internally uses adjusted earnings before interest and taxes adjusted ebit adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda and adjusted net earnings to evaluate the company’s performance ebit ebitda and net earnings are typically derived directly from the company’s consolidated statement of earnings however they may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods 

based on the above definitions our calculation of adjusted ebit is summarized below

given our free cash flow projections and unused credit facilities that are available until december 2015 our liquidity is strong and is expected to meet our ongoing operating cash flow and debt service requirements while the recent financial and economic conditions have raised concerns about credit risk with counterparties to derivative transactions the company mitigates its exposure by spreading the risk among various counterparties and limiting exposure to any one party we also monitor the credit ratings of our suppliers customers lenders and counterparties on a regular basis 

we were in compliance with all loan agreements at december 31 2010 and all prior years presented and have met all debt payment obligations the us note agreements bank credit agreement and industrial development revenue bond agreements contain certain restrictions relating to dividends investments financial ratios guarantees and the incurrence of additional indebtedness additional details about our debt and receivables sales agreements are available in notes 12 and 6 respectively accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report

contributions to the company’s defined benefit pension plans not including the unfunded german plans are expected to be in the range of 30 million in 2011 this estimate may change based on changes in the pension protection act and actual plan asset performance among other factors benefit payments related to these plans are expected to be 714 million 740 million 771 million 803 million and 849 million for the years ending december 31 2011 through 2015 respectively and a total of 4831 million for the years 2016 through 2020 payments to participants in the unfunded german plans are expected to be between 218 million €165 million to 232 million €175 million in each of the years 2011 through 2015 and a total of 1027 million €775 million for the years 2016 through 2020 

for the us pension plans in 2011 we changed our return on asset assumption to 800 percent from 825 percent in 2010 and our discount rate assumption to an average of 555 percent from 600 percent in 2010 based on the changes in assumptions pension expense in 2011 is anticipated to be relatively flat compared to 2010 a reduction of the expected return on pension assets assumption by a quarter of a percentage point would result in an estimated 29 million increase in the 2011 global pension expense while a quarter of a percentage point reduction in the discount rate applied to the pension liability would result in an estimated 35 million of additional pension expense in 2011 additional information regarding the company’s pension plans is provided in note 14 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial instruments and risk management 

in the ordinary course of business we employ established risk management policies and procedures which seek to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices interest rates foreign currencies and prices of the company’s common stock in respect of common share repurchases although there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be successful although the instruments utilized involve varying degrees of credit market and interest risk the counterparties to the agreements are expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements the company monitors counterparty credit risk including that of its lenders on a regular basis but we cannot be certain that all risks will be discerned or that our risk management policies and procedures will always be effective 

we have estimated our market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis market risk exposure has been defined as the changes in fair value of derivative instruments financial instruments and commodity positions to test the sensitivity of our market risk exposure we have estimated the changes in fair value of market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in market prices or rates the results of the sensitivity analyses are summarized below 

commodity price risk 

we manage our commodity price risk in the americas in connection with market price fluctuations of aluminum ingot primarily by entering into container sales contracts that include aluminum ingotbased pricing terms that generally reflect price fluctuations under our commercial supply contracts for aluminum purchases the terms include fixed floating or passthrough aluminum ingot component pricing this matched pricing affects most of our aluminum packagingrelated net sales in the americas we also at times use certain derivative instruments such as option and forward contracts as cash flow hedges of commodity price risk where there is not a passthrough arrangement in the sales contract to match underlying purchase volumes and pricing with sales volumes and pricing 

in europe and the prc the company manages the aluminum and steel raw material commodity price risks through annual and longterm contracts for the purchase of the materials as well as certain sales contracts that reduce the company’s exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices within the current year these contracts include fixed price floating andor passthrough pricing arrangements we also use forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges to manage future aluminum price risk and foreign exchange exposures to match underlying purchase volumes and pricing with sales volumes and pricing for those sales contracts where there is not a passthrough arrangement to minimize the company’s exposure to significant price changes 

most metal food and household products packaging americas steel packagingrelated sales contracts either include provisions permitting us to pass through some or all steel cost changes we incur or they incorporate annually negotiated steel costs in 2010 and in 2009 we were able to pass through to our customers the majority of the steel cost increases we anticipate at this time that we will be able to pass through the majority of the steel price increases that may occur in 2011 

considering the effects of derivative instruments the company’s ability to pass through certain raw material costs through contractual provisions the market’s ability to accept price increases and the company’s commodity price exposures under its contract terms a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the company’s steel and aluminum prices could result in an estimated 27 million aftertax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period additionally the company has foreign currency exposures on raw materials and the effect of a 10 percent adverse change is included in the total foreign currency exposure discussed below actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates 

the company is also exposed to fluctuations in prices for natural gas and electricity as well as the cost of diesel fuel as a component of freight cost a hypothetical 10 percent increase in our natural gas and electricity prices could result in an estimated 52 million aftertax reduction of net earnings over a oneyear period a hypothetical 10 percent increase in diesel fuel prices could result in an estimated 07 million aftertax reduction of net earnings over the same period actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates 

page 29 of 100 

  

  

  

interest rate risk 

our objective in managing our exposure to interest rate changes is to minimize the impact of such changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we may use a variety of interest rate swaps collars and options to manage our mix of floating and fixedrate debt interest rate instruments held by the company at december 31 2010 included payfixed interest rate swaps which effectively convert variable rate obligations to fixed rate instruments 

based on our interest rate exposure at december 31 2010 assumed floating rate debt levels throughout the next 12 months and the effects of derivative instruments a 100basis point increase in interest rates could result in an estimated 45 million aftertax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates and the timing of these changes 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to protect foreign cash flows and earnings from changes associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes through the use of various derivative contracts in addition at times we manage foreign earnings translation volatility through the use of various foreign currency option strategies and the change in the fair value of those options is recorded in the company’s earnings our foreign currency translation risk results from the euro british pound canadian dollar polish zloty chinese renminbi hong kong dollar brazilian real argentine peso serbian dinar and czech koruna we face currency exposures in our global operations as a result of purchasing raw materials in us dollars and to a lesser extent in other currencies sales contracts are negotiated with customers to reflect cost changes and where there is not a foreign exchange passthrough arrangement the company uses forward and option contracts to manage foreign currency exposures we additionally use various option strategies to manage the earnings translation of the company’s european operations into us dollars 

considering the company’s derivative financial instruments outstanding at december 31 2010 and the currency exposures a hypothetical 10 percent reduction us dollar strengthening in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the us dollar could result in an estimated 273 million aftertax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period this hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would also reduce our forecasted average debt balance by 243 million actual changes in market prices or rates may differ from hypothetical changes 

equity price risk 

the company’s deferred compensation stock program is subject to variable accounting and accordingly is marked to market using the company’s closing stock price at the end of a reporting period based on current share levels in the program each 1 change in the company’s stock price has an effect of 17 million on pretax earnings

 item 1 business 

ball corporation ball we the company or our is one of the world’s leading suppliers of metal and plastic packaging to the beverage food and household products industries our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses and are manufactured in plants around the world we also supply aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers within our aerospace and technologies segment ball aerospace in 2009 our total consolidated net sales were 735 billion our packaging businesses are responsible for 91 percent of our net sales with the remaining 9 percent contributed by our aerospace business 

our largest product lines are aluminum and steel beverage containers which accounted for 63 percent of our 2009 total net sales and 77 percent of our 2009 total earnings before interest and taxes we also produce steel food containers steel aerosol containers polyethylene terepthalate pet and polypropylene plastic bottles for beverages and foods steel paint cans and decorative steel tins 

we sell our packaging products primarily to major beverage food and household products companies with which we have developed longterm customer relationships this is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of longterm supply contracts we sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major companies in north america europe the people’s republic of china prc and argentina as do our equity joint ventures in brazil the us and the prc 

ball aerospace is a leader in the design development and manufacture of innovative aerospace systems it produces spacecraft instruments and sensors radio frequency and microwave technologies data exploitation solutions and a variety of advanced aerospace technologies and products that enable deep space missions 

our corporate strategy is to grow our worldwide beverage container business and our aerospace business to continue to leverage and develop the metal food and household products packaging americas segment to improve the performance of the plastic packaging americas segment and to utilize free cash flow and earnings growth to increase shareholder value

our reporting segments 

ball corporation reports its financial performance in   five reportable segments organized along a combination of product lines after aggregating operating segments that have similar economic characteristics 1 metal beverage packaging americas and asia 2 metal beverage packaging europe 3 metal food and household products packaging americas 4 plastic packaging americas and 5 aerospace and technologies we also have investments in companies in the us the prc and brazil which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and accordingly those results are not included in segment sales or earnings 

profitability is sensitive to selling prices production volumes labor transportation utility and warehousing costs as well as the availability and price of raw materials such as aluminum sheet tinplate steel plastic resin and other direct materials these raw materials are generally available from several sources and we have secured what we consider to be adequate supplies and are not experiencing any shortages there has been significant consolidation of raw material suppliers in both north america and in europe raw materials and energy sources such as natural gas and electricity may from time to time be in short supply or unavailable due to external factors we cannot predict the timing or effects if any of such occurrences on future operations 

a substantial part of ball’s packaging sales are made directly to companies in packaged beverage and food businesses including millercoors llc anheuserbusch inbev nvsa and bottlers of pepsicola and cocacola branded beverages and their affiliates that utilize consolidated purchasing groups 

metal beverage packaging americas and asia segment 

metal beverage packaging americas and asia is ball’s largest segment accounting for 39 percent of consolidated net sales in 2009 metal beverage containers are primarily sold under multiyear supply contracts to fillers of carbonated soft drinks beer energy drinks and other beverages 

americas 

according to publicly available information and company estimates the combined us and canadian metal beverage container markets represent more than 100 billion units five companies manufacture substantially all of the metal beverage containers in the us and canada two of these producers and three other independent producers also manufacture metal beverage containers in mexico ball produced in excess of 31 billion recyclable beverage containers in the us and canada in 2009 – about 31 percent of the total market sales volumes of metal beverage containers in north america tend to be highest during the period from april through september all of the beverage cans produced by ball in the us and canada are made of aluminum as are all beverage cans produced by our competitors in the us canada and mexico in 2009 we were able to recover substantially all aluminumrelated cost increases levied by producers through either financial or contractual means in north america four aluminum suppliers provide virtually all of our requirements some of those aluminum suppliers have experienced significant financial and liquidity constraints in recent years 

we believe we have limited our exposure related to changes in the costs of aluminum ingot as a result of the inclusion of provisions in most aluminum container sales contracts to pass through aluminum ingot price changes as well as the use of derivative instruments 

beverage containers are sold based on quality service innovation and price in a highly competitive market which is relatively capital intensive and is characterized by plants that run more or less continuously in order to operate profitably in addition the aluminum beverage container competes aggressively with other packaging materials the glass bottle has shown resilience in the packaged beer industry while the pet container has grown significantly in the carbonated soft drink and water industries over the past quarter century in canada metal beverage containers have captured significantly lower percentages of packaged beverage industry volumes than in the us particularly in the packaged beer industry 

twopiece aluminum beverage containers are produced at 17 manufacturing facilities in the us and one in canada can ends are produced within four of the us facilities as well as in two facilities that manufacture only can ends through rocky mountain metal container llc a 50percentowned joint venture which is accounted for as an equity investment ball and millercoors llc operate beverage container and can end manufacturing facilities in golden colorado 

  

page 2 of 97 

  

on october 1 2009 the company acquired three of anheuserbusch inbev nvsa’s ab inbev metal beverage container manufacturing plants and one of its beverage can end manufacturing plants all of which are located in the us for 5747 million in cash the acquired plants produce about 10 billion aluminum containers and 10 billion beverage can ends annually more than twothirds of which are produced for leading soft drink companies and the rest for ab inbev with the shipments from the acquired plants ball estimates its annual shipments will grow to approximately 40 percent of total us and canadian shipments 

we participate in a 50percentowned joint venture in brazil latapackball embalagens ltda that manufactures aluminum beverage cans and ends and is accounted for as an equity investment the brazilian joint venture recently expanded capacity at its existing metal beverage container manufacturing facility near jacarei and completed the construction of a new plant near rio de janeiro 

in order to more closely balance capacity and demand within our business during 2008 and 2009 ball completed the closure of three metal beverage packaging plants in north america 

 

 

where growth is projected in certain markets or for certain products ball is undertaking selected capacity increases in its existing facilities and may establish or obtain additional manufacturing capacity to the extent required by the growth of any of the markets we serve 

asia 

the beverage can market in the prc is approximately 13 billion containers of which ball’s operations represent an estimated 22 percent with an additional 13 percent manufactured by two joint ventures in which we participate our percentage of the industry makes us one of the largest manufacturers of beverage containers in the prc six other manufacturers make up the remainder of the market our operations include the manufacture of aluminum cans and ends in three plants in the prc as well as in our two joint ventures capacity grew rapidly in the prc in the late 1990s resulting in a supplydemand imbalance the rapid growth slowed in the early 2000s and a number of can makers including ball responded by rationalizing capacity growth has resumed over the past several years and we expect the prc market to continue to grow over time we also manufacture and sell highdensity plastic containers in two prc plants primarily servicing the motor oil industry 

on november 9 2009 we announced our agreement to acquire guangdong jianlibao group co ltd’s jianlibao 65percent interest in a joint venture metal beverage can and end plant in sanshui prc we have owned 35 percent of the joint venture plant since 1992 we will acquire the plant and related assets for approximately 90 million in cash and assumed debt and will also enter into a longterm supply agreement with jianlibao the transaction is expected to close in 2010 subject to customary regulatory approvals 

metal beverage packaging europe segment 

the european beverage can market excluding russia is approximately 47 billion cans and ball packaging europe is the second largest metal beverage container producer with an estimated 32 percent of the european shipments while current economic conditions have slowed growth in the near term the european market is expected to grow and is highly regional in terms of sales growth rates and packaging mix growth in central and eastern europe has been particularly strong in past years but has been impacted by the global economic environment causing the company to delay completion of its new plant in lublin poland western european markets including the united kingdom and france continue to maintain historical volumes and growth characteristics 

  

page 3 of 97 

  

sales volumes of metal beverage containers in europe tend to be highest during the period from may through august with a smaller increase in demand during the winter holiday season for the united kingdom as in north america the metal beverage container competes aggressively with other packaging materials used by the european beer and carbonated soft drink industries the glass bottle is heavily utilized in the packaged beer industry while the pet container is utilized in the carbonated soft drink beer juice and mineral water industries 

the metal beverage packaging europe segment which accounted for 24 percent of ball’s consolidated net sales in 2009 supplies twopiece beverage cans and can ends for producers of beer carbonated soft drinks mineral water fruit juices energy drinks and other beverages the european operations consist of 12 plants – 10 beverage can plants and two beverage can end plants – of which four are located in germany three in the united kingdom two in france and one each in the netherlands poland and serbia in addition ball packaging europe is currently renting additional space on the premises of a supplier in haslach germany in order to   produce   the ball resealable   end bre   the   european plants   produced   approximately 16 billion cans in 2009 with approximately 57 percent of those being produced from aluminum and 43 percent from steel six of the can plants use aluminum and four use steel 

european raw material supply contracts are generally for a period of one year although ball packaging europe has negotiated some longer term agreements in europe three steel suppliers and four aluminum suppliers provide approximately 95 percent of our requirements aluminum is traded primarily in us dollars while the functional currencies of ball packaging europe and its subsidiaries are nonus dollars the company generally tries to minimize the resulting foreign exchange rate risk with supply contracts in local currencies and the use of derivative contracts in addition purchase and sales contracts include fixed price floating and passthrough pricing arrangements 

metal food  household products packaging americas segment 

the metal food and household products packaging americas segment accounted for 19 percent of consolidated net sales in 2009 the two major product lines in this segment are steel food and aerosol containers ball produces twopiece and threepiece steel food containers and ends for packaging vegetables fruit soups meat seafood nutritional products pet food and other products the segment also manufactures and sells aerosol cans paint cans and custom and specialty containers we are the largest manufacturer of aerosol cans in north america there are a total of 14 plants in the us and canada that produce these products in addition the company manufactures and sells aerosol cans in two plants in argentina 

sales volumes of metal food containers in north america tend to be highest from may through october as a result of seasonal fruit vegetable and salmon packs we estimate our 2009 shipments of more than 51 billion steel food containers to be approximately 18 percent of total us and canadian metal food container shipments we estimate our aerosol business accounts for approximately 45 percent of total annual us and canadian steel aerosol shipments 

competitors in the metal food container product line include two national and a small number of regional suppliers and self manufacturers several producers in mexico also manufacture steel food containers competition in the us steel aerosol can market primarily includes two national suppliers and a regional supplier in the midwest steel containers also compete with other packaging materials in the food and household products industry including glass aluminum plastic paper and the standup pouch as a result demand for this product line is dependent on product innovation and cost reduction service quality and price are among the other key competitive factors in north america two steel suppliers provide nearly 70 percent of our tinplate steel we believe we have limited our exposure related to changes in the costs of steel tinplate as a result of the inclusion of provisions in certain steel container sales contracts to pass through steel cost changes and the existence of certain other steel container sales contracts that incorporate annually negotiated metal costs in 2009 we were able to pass through the majority of steel cost increases levied by producers 

cost containment is crucial to maintaining profitability in the food and aerosol container manufacturing industries and ball is focused on doing so toward that end during 2008 and 2009 ball closed its aerosol container manufacturing plants in tallapoosa georgia and commerce california the two plant closures result in a net reduction in manufacturing capacity of 10 production lines including the relocation of two highspeed aerosol lines to other existing ball facilities and allow us to supply customers from a consolidated asset base

plastic packaging americas segment 

demand for containers made of pet and polypropylene has slowed in the beverage and food markets due to current economic conditions while pet and polypropylene beverage containers compete against metal glass and cardboard the historical increase in the sales of pet containers has come primarily at the expense of glass containers and through new market introductions 

competition in the pet plastic container industry is intense and includes several national and regional suppliers and self manufacturers in the smaller polypropylene container industry ball is one of three major competitors service quality innovation and price are important competitive factors with price being by far the most important the ability to produce customized differentiated plastic containers is also a key competitive factor we believe we have limited our exposure related to changes in the costs of plastic resin as a result of the inclusion of resin cost passthrough provisions in substantially all plastic container sales contracts 

plastic packaging americas accounted for 9 percent of ball’s consolidated net sales in 2009 we estimate our 2009 shipments of 5 billion plastic bottles to be approximately 8 percent of total us pet container shipments in addition this segment shipped approximately 625 million polypropylene food and specialty containers during 2009 the company operates five plastic container manufacturing facilities in the us 

most of ball’s pet containers are sold under longterm contracts to suppliers of bottled water and carbonated soft drinks including bottlers of pepsicola branded beverages and their affiliates that utilize consolidated purchasing groups most of our polypropylene containers are also sold under longterm contracts primarily to food packaging companies we are also manufacturing plastic containers for the singleserve juice and wine markets our line of heattek® pet plastic bottles for hotfilled beverages such as sports drinks and juices includes sizes from 8 ounces to 64 ounces 

ball’s emphasis in this segment is on customized differentiated containers this includes unique barrier plastics such as gamma® gammaclear® amazonhm® and khs corpoplast gmbh plasmax® barrier bottles we are continuing to limit investment in the carbonated soft drink and bottled water business which is a commodity business where the return on investment has been unacceptable 

on october 23 2009 we sold our plastic pail assets to bway corporation for approximately 32 million the transaction involved the sale of a plastic pail manufacturing plant in newnan georgia which ball acquired in 2006 as part of its purchase of us can corporation as well as associated contracts the plant produces injection molded plastic pails and drums for products such as building materials and pool chemicals the associated aftertax loss was insignificant 

to reduce costs and gain efficiencies during 2008 and 2009 ball closed three facilities in baldwinsville new york watertown wisconsin and brampton ontario the three plants’ operations have been consolidated into our other plastic packaging manufacturing facilities in the united states 

aerospace and technologies segment 

ball’s aerospace and technologies segment which accounted for 9 percent of consolidated net sales in 2009 includes national defense antenna and video technologies civil and operational space and systems engineering solutions businesses the segment develops spacecraft sensors and instruments radio frequency systems and other advanced technologies for the civil commercial and national security aerospace markets the majority of the aerospace and technologies business involves work under contracts generally from one to five years in duration as a prime contractor or subcontractor for the us department of defense dod the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and other us government agencies contracts funded by the various agencies of the federal government represented 94 percent of segment sales in 2009 

geopolitical events shifting executive and legislative branch priorities as well as funding shortfalls combined with increased competition for new business have resulted in a decline in opportunities in areas matching our aerospace and technologies segment’s core capabilities in space hardware although we have seen declines in our space hardware opportunities our traditional strength we have seen growth in opportunities related to our information services and tactical components the businesses include hardware software and services sold primarily to us customers with emphasis on space science and exploration environmental and earth sciences and defense and intelligence applications major contractual activities frequently involve the design manufacture and testing of satellites remote sensors and ground station control hardware and software as well as related services such as launch vehicle integration and satellite operations

other hardware activities include target identification warning and attitude control systems and components cryogenic systems for reactant storage and associated sensor cooling devices star trackers which are generalpurpose stellar attitude sensors and faststeering mirrors additionally the aerospace and technologies segment provides diversified technical services and products to government agencies prime contractors and commercial organizations for a broad range of information warfare electronic warfare avionics intelligence training and space systems needs 

backlog in the aerospace and technologies segment was 518 million and 597 million at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively and consists of the aggregate contract value of firm orders excluding amounts previously recognized as revenue the 2009 backlog includes 344 million expected to be recognized in revenues during 2010 with the remainder expected to be recognized in revenues thereafter unfunded amounts included in backlog for certain firm government orders which are subject to annual funding were 261 million and 309 million at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively yearoveryear comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations 

on february 15 2008 the segment completed the sale of its shares in ball solutions group pty ltd bsg to qinetiq pty ltd for approximately 105 million including cash sold of 18 million bsg was previously a wholly owned australian subsidiary that provided services to the australian department of defense and related government agencies after an adjustment for working capital items the sale resulted in a pretax gain of 71 million 

ball’s aerospace and technologies segment has contracts with the us government or its contractors that have standard termination provisions the government retains the right to terminate contracts at its convenience however if contracts are terminated in this manner ball is entitled to reimbursement for allowable costs and profits on authorized work performed through the date of termination us government contracts are also subject to reduction or modification in the event of changes in government requirements or budgetary constraints 

patents 

in the opinion of the company none of its active patents is essential to the successful operation of its business as a whole 

research and development 

research and development rd efforts in the north american packaging segments as well as in the european metal beverage container business are primarily directed toward packaging innovation specifically the development of new features sizes shapes and types of containers as well as new uses for existing containers other rd efforts in these segments seek to improve manufacturing efficiencies our north american packaging rd activities are primarily conducted in the ball technology  innovation center btic located in westminster colorado the european rd activities are primarily conducted in a technical center located in bonn germany 

in our aerospace business we continue to focus our rd activities on the design development and manufacture of innovative aerospace systems this includes the production of spacecraft instruments and sensors radio frequency and microwave technologies data exploitation solutions and a variety of advanced aerospace technologies and products that enable deep space missions our aerospace rd activities are conducted in various locations in the us 

additional information regarding company research and development activity is contained in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report as well as included in item 2 “properties” 

sustainability and the environment 

throughout our company’s history we have focused on sustainability and the environment in all aspects of our businesses and recently have formalized our initiatives we continue to make progress on the sustainability goals stated in the sustainability report we issued in june 2008 we have committed to formally report on the status of our sustainability efforts in 2010 

key issues for our company include reducing our use of electricity and natural gas reducing waste and increasing recycling at our facilities analyzing and reducing our water consumption reducing our existing volatile organic compounds and further improving safety performance in our facilities 

the 2008 recycling rate in the united states for aluminum cans was 54 percent the highest recycling rate for any beverage container other 2008 us recycling rates were 65 percent for steel cans 27 percent for pet bottles and 11 percent for polypropylene bottles according to the most recently published data the aluminum can sheet we buy contains an average of 44 percent post consumer recycled content and the average post consumer recycled content for steel cans is 28 percent 

  

page 6 of 97 

  

recycling rates vary throughout europe but average around 60 percent for aluminum and steel containers which exceeds the european union’s goal of 50 percent recycling for metals due in part to the intrinsic value of aluminum and steel metal packaging recycling rates in europe compare favorably to those of other packaging materials ball’s european operations help establish and financially support recycling initiatives in growing markets such as poland and serbia to educate consumers about the benefits of recycling aluminum and steel cans and to increase recycling rates we have initiated a similar program in china to educate consumers in that market regarding the benefits of recycling 

compliance with federal state and local laws relating to protection of the environment has not had a material adverse effect upon the capital expenditures earnings or competitive position of the company as more fully described under item 3 “legal proceedings” the us environmental protection agency and various state environmental agencies have designated the company as a potentially responsible party along with numerous other companies for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites however the company’s information at this time indicates that these matters will not have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity results of operations or financial condition of the company 

legislation that would prohibit tax or restrict the sale or use of certain types of containers or would require diversion of solid wastes including packaging materials from disposal in landfills has been or may be introduced anywhere we operate while container legislation has been adopted in some jurisdictions similar legislation has been defeated in public referenda and legislative bodies in numerous others the company anticipates that continuing efforts will be made to consider and adopt such legislation in many jurisdictions in the future if such legislation were widely adopted it could potentially have a material adverse effect on the business of the company including its liquidity results of operations or financial condition as well as on the container manufacturing industry generally in view of the company’s substantial global sales and investment in metal and pet container manufacturing however the packages we produce are widely used and perform well in us states canadian provinces and european countries that have deposit systems 

employee relations 

at the end of 2009 the company and its subsidiaries employed approximately 10500 employees in the us and 4000 in other countries an additional 1100 people were employed in unconsolidated joint ventures in which ball participates 

approximately 40 percent of balls north american packaging plant employees are unionized and most of our european plant employees are union workers collective bargaining agreements with various unions in the us have terms of three to five years and those in europe have terms of one to two years the agreements expire at regular intervals and are customarily renewed in the ordinary course after bargaining between union and company representatives the company believes that its employee relations are good and that its safety training education diversity and retention practices assist in enhancing employee satisfaction levels

 item 1a risk factors 

any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

there can be no assurance that the acquisition of certain ab inbev plants or any other acquisition will be successfully integrated into the acquiring company see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report for details of the acquisition 

while we have what we believe to be well designed integration plans if we cannot successfully integrate the acquired operations with those of ball we may experience material negative consequences to our business financial condition or results of operations the integration of companies that have previously been operated separately involves a number of risks including but not limited to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we may not be able to achieve potential synergies or maintain the levels of revenue earnings or operating efficiency that each business had achieved or might achieve separately the successful integration of the acquired operations will depend on our ability to manage those operations realize revenue opportunities and to some degree eliminate redundant and excess costs 

the loss of a key customer or a reduction in its requirements could have a significant negative impact on our sales 

we sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major beverage packaged food and household product companies some of which operate in north america south america europe and asia 

although the majority of our customer contracts are longterm these contracts are terminable under certain circumstances such as our failure to meet quality volume or market pricing requirements because we depend on relatively few major customers our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss of any of these customers a reduction in the purchasing levels of these customers a strike or work stoppage by a significant number of these customers employees or an adverse change in the terms of the supply agreements with these customers 

the primary customers for our aerospace segment are us government agencies or their prime contractors our contracts with these customers are subject to several risks including funding cuts and delays technical uncertainties budget changes competitive activity and changes in scope 

we face competitive risks from many sources that may negatively impact our profitability 

competition within the packaging industry is intense increases in productivity combined with existing or potential surplus capacity in the industry have maintained competitive pricing pressures the principal methods of competition in the general packaging industry are price service and quality some of our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources our current or potential competitors may offer products at a lower price or products that are deemed superior to ours the global economic environment may result in reductions in demand for our products which in turn could increase these competitive pressures 

we are subject to competition from alternative products which could result in lower profits and reduced cash flows 

our metal packaging products are subject to significant competition from substitute products particularly plastic carbonated soft drink bottles made from pet single serve beer bottles and other food and beverage containers made of glass cardboard or other materials competition from plastic carbonated soft drink bottles is particularly intense in the united states the united kingdom and the prc certain of our aerospace products are also subject to competition from alternative solutions there can be no assurance that our products will successfully compete against alternative products which could result in a reduction in our profits or cash flow 

  

page 8 of 97 

  

we have a narrow product range and our business would suffer if usage of our products decreased 

for the 12 months ended december 31 2009 63 percent of our consolidated net sales were from the sale of metal beverage cans and we expect to derive a significant portion of our future revenues and cash flows from the sale of metal beverage cans our business would suffer if the use of metal beverage cans decreased accordingly broad acceptance by consumers of aluminum and steel cans for a wide variety of beverages is critical to our future success if demand for glass and pet bottles increases relative to cans or the demand for aluminum and steel cans does not develop as expected our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

changes in laws and governmental regulations may adversely affect our business and operations 

we and our customers and suppliers are subject to various federal state and provincial laws and regulations each of our and their plants is subject to federal state provincial and local licensing and regulation by health environmental workplace safety and other agencies requirements of governmental authorities with respect to manufacturing product content and safety climate change workplace safety and health and environmental and other standards could adversely affect our ability to manufacture or sell our products in addition we face risks arising from compliance with and enforcement of increasingly numerous and complex federal state and provincial laws and regulations 

our operations in the us are subject to the fair labor standards act which governs such matters as minimum wages overtime and other working conditions family leave mandates and similar state laws that govern these and other employment law matters the us federal government has proposed sweeping changes to laws affecting the health care of all americans including our employees as well as new or changing laws or regulations relating to union organizing rights and activities that may impact our operations and increase our cost of labor significant environmental legislation and regulatory changes are also being considered the compliance costs associated with current and proposed laws and evolving regulations could be substantial and any failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws or regulations could lead to litigation all of which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

our business financial condition and results of operations are subject to risks resulting from increased international operations 

we derived approximately 30 percent of our consolidated net sales from outside of the us for the year ended december 31 2009 this sizeable scope of international operations may lead to more volatile financial results and make it more difficult for us to manage our business reasons for this include but are not limited to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any of these factors some of which are also present in the us could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations 

our reporting currency is the us dollar historically balls foreign operations including assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses have been denominated in various currencies other than the us dollar and we expect that our foreign operations will continue to be so denominated as a result the us dollar value of balls foreign operations has varied and will continue to vary with exchange rate fluctuations ball has been and is presently primarily exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate of the euro british pound canadian dollar polish zloty chinese renminbi brazilian real argentine peso and serbian dinar 

a decrease in the value of any of these currencies especially the euro british pound polish zloty chinese renminbi and canadian dollar relative to the us dollar could reduce our profits from foreign operations and the value of the net assets of our foreign operations when reported in us dollars in our financial statements this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations as reported in us dollars in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to currencies in which the earnings are generated may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations 

  

page 9 of 97 

  

we manage our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations particularly our exposure to fluctuations in the euro to us dollar exchange rate in order to attempt to mitigate the effect of foreign cash flow and earnings volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes we primarily use forward contracts and options to manage our foreign currency exposures and as a result we experience gains and losses on these derivative positions offset in part by the impact of currency fluctuations on existing assets and liabilities our inability to properly manage our exposure to currency fluctuations could materially impact our results 

our business operating results and financial condition are subject to particular risks in certain regions of the world 

we may experience an operating loss in one or more regions of the world for one or more periods which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition moreover overcapacity which often leads to lower prices exists in a number of the regions in which we operate and may persist even if demand grows our ability to manage such operational fluctuations and to maintain adequate longterm strategies in the face of such developments will be critical to our continued growth and profitability 

if we fail to retain key management and personnel we may be unable to implement our key objectives 

we believe that our future success depends in part on our experienced management team losing the services of key members of our management team could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet our objectives 

decreases in our ability to apply new technology and knowhow may affect our competitiveness 

our success depends partially on our ability to improve production processes and services we must also introduce new products and services to meet changing customer needs if we are unable to implement better production processes or to develop new products we may not be able to remain competitive with other manufacturers as a result our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

adverse weather and climate changes may result in lower sales 

we manufacture packaging products primarily for beverages and foods unseasonably cool weather can reduce demand for certain beverages packaged in our containers in addition poor weather conditions or changes in climate that reduce crop yields of fruits and vegetables can adversely affect demand for our food containers climate change could have various effects on the demand for our products in different regions around the world 

we are vulnerable to fluctuations in the supply and price of raw materials 

we purchase aluminum steel plastic resin and other raw materials and packaging supplies from several sources while all such materials are available from independent suppliers raw materials are subject to fluctuations in price and availability attributable to a number of factors including general economic conditions commodity price fluctuations particularly aluminum on the london metal exchange the demand by other industries for the same raw materials and the availability of complementary and substitute materials although we enter into commodities purchase agreements from time to time and use derivative instruments to manage our risk we cannot ensure that our current suppliers of raw materials will be able to supply us with sufficient quantities at reasonable prices economic and financial factors could impact our suppliers thereby causing supply shortages increases in raw material costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in north america and europe some contracts do not allow us to pass along increased raw material costs and we use derivative agreements to manage this risk our hedging procedures may be insufficient and our results could be materially impacted if costs of materials increase due to the fixed price contracts and derivative activities while increasing raw material costs may not impact our nearterm profitability increased prices could decrease our sales volume over time 

prolonged work stoppages at plants with union employees could jeopardize our financial position 

as of december 31 2009 approximately 40 percent of our north american packaging plant employees and most of our packaging plant employees in europe were covered by collective bargaining agreements these collective bargaining agreements have staggered expirations during the next several years although we consider our employee relations to be generally good a prolonged work stoppage or strike at any facility with union employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition we cannot ensure that upon the expiration of existing collective bargaining agreements new agreements will be reached without union action or that any such new agreements will be on terms satisfactory to us potential legislation has been discussed in the united states which may if enacted facilitate the ability of unions to unionize workers and to establish collective bargaining agreements with employers including the company 

  

page 10 of 97 

  

our aerospace and technologies segment is subject to certain risks specific to that business including those outlined below 

in our aerospace business existing us government contracts are subject to continued appropriations by congress and may be terminated or delayed if future funding is not made available 

our backlog includes both costtype and fixedprice contracts costtype contracts generally have lower profit margins than fixedprice contracts our earnings and margins may vary depending on the types of government contracts undertaken the nature of the work performed under those contracts the costs incurred in performing the work the achievement of other performance objectives and their impact on our ability to receive fees 

our business is subject to substantial environmental remediation and compliance costs 

our operations are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental hazards such as emissions to air discharges to water the handling and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes and the cleanup of hazardous substances the us environmental protection agency has designated us along with numerous other companies as a potentially responsible party for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites based on available information we do not believe that any costs incurred in connection with such sites will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations capital expenditures or competitive position there is increased focus on the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental issues worldwide 

net earnings and net worth could be materially affected by an impairment of goodwill 

we have a significant amount of goodwill recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2009 we are required annually to test the recoverability of goodwill the recoverability test of goodwill is based on the current fair value of our identified reporting units fair value measurement requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors including revenue and market growth operating cash flows and discount rates if general market conditions deteriorate in portions of our business we could experience a significant decline in the fair value of reporting units this decline could lead to an impairment of all or a significant portion of the goodwill balance which could materially affect our net earnings and net worth 

if the investments in balls pension plans do not perform as expected we may have to contribute additional amounts to the plans which would otherwise be available to cover operating expenses 

ball maintains defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of its north american and united kingdom employees which we fund based on certain actuarial assumptions the plans’ assets consist primarily of common stocks fixed income securities and in the us alternative investments market declines longevity increases or legislative changes such as the pension protection act in the us could result in a prospective decrease in our available cash flow and net earnings over time and the recognition of an increase in our pension obligations could result in a reduction to our shareholders equity 

restricted access to capital markets could adversely affect our shortterm liquidity and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the notes issued pursuant to our bond indentures 

on december 31 2009 we had total debt of 26 billion and unused committed credit lines in excess of 600 million a reduction of financial liquidity could have important consequences including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition more than one third of our debt bears interest at variable rates if market interest rates increase variablerate debt will create higher debt service requirements which would adversely affect our cash flow while we sometimes enter into agreements limiting our exposure any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk 

  

page 11 of 97 

  

changes in us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap and securities and exchange commission sec rules and regulations could materially impact our reported results 

us gaap and sec accounting and reporting changes are common and have become more frequent and significant over the past few years these changes could have significant effects on our reported results when compared to prior periods and may even require us to retrospectively adjust prior periods additionally material changes to the presentation of transactions in the consolidated financial statements could impact key ratios that analysts and credit rating agencies use to rate ball the material changes in net earnings andor presentation of transactions could impact our credit rating and ultimately our ability to access the credit markets in an efficient manner 

the global credit financial and economic environment could have a negative impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

the global credit financial and economic environment could have significant negative effects on our operations including but not limited to the following

management’s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in item 8 of this report which include additional information about our accounting policies practices and the transactions underlying our financial results the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires us to makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes including various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits taxes environmental and other matters arising during the normal course of business we apply our best judgment our knowledge of existing facts and circumstances and actions that we may undertake in the future in determining the estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances such as current economic conditions and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change as future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision actual results may differ from these estimates ball corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as “ball” or “the company” or “we” or “our” in the following discussion and analysis 

overview 

business overview 

ball corporation is one of the world’s leading suppliers of metal and plastic packaging to the beverage food and household products industries our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses and are manufactured in plants around the world we also provide aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers 

we sell our packaging products primarily to major beverage food and household products companies with which we have developed longterm customer relationships this is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of longterm supply contracts while we have a diversified customer base we sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major companies in north america europe the people’s republic of china prc and argentina as do our equity joint ventures in brazil the us and the prc we also purchase raw materials from relatively few suppliers because of our customer and supplier concentration our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss insolvency or bankruptcy of a major customer or supplier or a change in a supply agreement with a major customer or supplier although our contracts and longterm relationships generally mitigate the risk of customer loss we are also subject to exposure from inflation and the rising costs of raw materials as well as other inputs into our direct costs we reduce our risk to these exposures either by fixing our material costs through derivative contracts or by including provisions in our sales contracts to recover the increases from our customers 

industry trends and corporate strategy 

in the rigid packaging industry sales and earnings can be improved by reducing costs increasing prices developing new products and expanding volumes over the past two years we have closed a number of packaging facilities in support of our ongoing objective of matching our supply with market demand we have also identified and implemented plans to improve our return on invested capital through the redeployment of assets within our operations 

as part of our packaging strategy we are focused on developing and marketing new and existing products that meet the needs of our customers and the ultimate consumer these innovations include new shapes sizes opening features and other functional benefits of both metal and plastic packaging this packaging development activity helps us maintain and expand our supply positions with major beverage food and household products customers 

while the north american beverage container manufacturing industry is relatively mature the european prc and brazilian beverage can markets are growing and are expected to continue to grow in the medium to long term while we are able to capitalize on this growth by increasing capacity in some of our european can manufacturing facilities by speeding up certain lines and by expansion we have put on hold various projects including the completion of the construction of a plant in poland due to the current worldwide economic environment however we continue to believe that central and eastern europe will be an area of growth once the economy recovers our brazilian joint venture has completed the construction of a metal beverage container plant near rio de janeiro and has added further can capacity in the existing jacarei can plant these brazilian expansion efforts are owned by ball’s unconsolidated 50percentowned joint venture latapackball embalagens ltda and the expansion was funded by cash flows from operations and incurrence of debt by the joint venture

ball’s consolidated earnings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and we attempt to mitigate this exposure through the use of derivative financial instruments as discussed in “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” within item 7a of this report 

the primary customers for the products and services provided by our aerospace and technologies segment are us government agencies or their prime contractors it is possible that federal budget reductions and priorities or changes in agency budgets could limit future funding and new contract awards or delay or prolong contract performance we expect that the delay of certain program awards as well as federal budget considerations will have an unfavorable impact on this segment in 2010 and we are continuing to take steps to adjust our resources accordingly  

we recognize sales under longterm contracts in the aerospace and technologies segment using the costtocost percentage of completion method of accounting our present contract mix consists of approximately twothirds costtype contracts which are billed at our costs plus an agreed upon andor earned profit component and approximately 20 percent fixedprice contracts the remainder represents time and material contracts which typically provide for the sale of engineering labor at fixed hourly rates failure to be awarded certain key contracts could further adversely affect segment performance in 2010 compared to 2009 

throughout the period of contract performance we regularly reevaluate and if necessary revise our estimates of ball aerospace and technologies corp’s total contract revenue total contract cost and progress toward completion because of contract payment schedules limitations on funding and other contract terms our sales and accounts receivable for this segment include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed 

management performance measures 

management uses various measures to evaluate company performance such as earnings before interest and taxes ebit earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda diluted earnings per share cash flow from operating activities free cash flow generally defined by the company as cash flow from operating activities less additions to property plant and equipment and economic value added net operating earnings after tax as defined by the company less a capital charge on net operating assets employed these financial measures may be adjusted at times for items that affect comparability between periods such as business consolidation costs and gains or losses on dispositions nonfinancial measures in the packaging segments include production efficiency and spoilage rates quality control figures environmental health and safety statistics production and sales volumes asset utilization rates and measures of sustainability additional measures used to evaluate financial performance in the aerospace and technologies segment include contract revenue realization award and incentive fees realized proposal win rates and backlog including awarded contracted and funded backlog 

we recognize that attracting developing and retaining highly talented employees are essential to the success of ball and because of that we strive to pay employees competitively and encourage their ownership of the company’s common stock as part of a diversified portfolio for most management employees a meaningful portion of compensation is at risk as an incentive dependent upon economic value added operating performance for more senior positions more compensation is at risk through economic value added performance and various longterm and stock compensation plans through our employee stock purchase plan and 401k plan which matches employee contributions with ball common stock employees regardless of organizational level have opportunities to own ball stock

results of operations 

consolidated sales and earnings 

the company has five reportable segments organized along a combination of product lines after aggregating operating segments that have similar economic characteristics 1 metal beverage packaging americas and asia 2 metal beverage packaging europe 3 metal food and household products packaging americas 4 plastic packaging americas and 5 aerospace and technologies we also have investments in companies in the us the prc and brazil which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and accordingly those results are not included in segment sales or earnings 

metal beverage packaging americas and asia 

 

 

the metal beverage packaging americas and asia segment consists of operations located in the us canada puerto rico through fiscal year 2008 and the prc which manufacture metal container products used in beverage packaging as well as nonbeverage plastic containers manufactured and sold mainly in the prc this segment accounted for 39 percent of consolidated net sales in 2009 40 percent in 2008 and 41 percent in 2007 including the impact of the 856 million legal settlement discussed below 

net sales were 3 percent lower in 2009 than in 2008 primarily as a result of the impact of lower aluminum prices partially offset by a 2 percent increase in sales volumes the higher sales volumes in 2009 were the result of incremental volumes from the four plants purchased from anheuserbusch inbev nvsa ab inbev on october 1 discussed further below partially offset by lower sales volumes and plant closures in the existing business excluding the effect of the legal settlement sales were 4 percent lower in 2008 than in 2007 primarily as a result of 2008 decreases in north american sales volumes of approximately 5 percent the decrease was due primarily to lower unit volume sales to carbonated soft drink customers consistent with the industry and lost beer sales volumes on the discontinuance of a contract that did not provide sufficient profitability this decrease was partially offset by sales volume increases in the prc of 14 percent during 2008 

based on publicly available information we estimate that our shipments of metal beverage containers in 2009 were approximately 31 percent of total us and canadian shipments and 22 percent of total prc shipments we continue to focus efforts on the growing custom beverage can business which includes cans of different shapes diameters and fill volumes and cans with added functional attributes for new products and product line extensions 

in 2007 a customer asserted various claims against the company primarily related to the pricing of the aluminum component of the containers supplied by a subsidiary and on october 4 2007 the dispute was settled in mediation the customer received 856 million 518 million after tax to settle the dispute and ball retained all of the customer’s beverage can and end supply through 2015 ball made a onetime payment of 703 million 425 million after tax in january 2008 with the remainder of the settlement to be recovered over the life of the supply contract 

excluding the business consolidation charges segment earnings in 2009 were higher than in 2008 due to 12 million of earnings contribution from the four acquired plants approximately 21 million of savings associated with the plant closures discussed below and 3 million of margin growth in asia partially offsetting these favorable impacts were lower carbonated soft drink and beer can sales volumes excluding the newly acquired plants and 25 million related to higher cost inventories in the first half of 2009 excluding the business consolidation charge in 2008 and the legal settlement in 2007 earnings in 2008 were lower than in 2007 by 13 percent primarily due to raw material inventory gains of 52 million realized in 2007 which did not recur in 2008 earnings in 2008 were also negatively impacted by lower north american sales volumes which were partially offset by the higher sales volumes in the prc

on october 1 2009 the company acquired three of anheuserbusch inbev nvsa’s ab inbev metal beverage can manufacturing plants and one of its beverage can end manufacturing plants all of which are located in the us for 5747 million in cash the acquired plants produce approximately 10 billion aluminum beverage containers and 10 billion beverage can ends annually more than twothirds of which are produced for leading soft drink companies and the rest for ab inbev the plants’ operations were included in ball’s results beginning october 1 2009 which amounted to 160 million of net sales and 12 million of segment earnings from that date through december 31 2009 the facilities acquired employ approximately 635 people the acquired plants will enhance the segment’s ability to better serve its customers 

on november 9 2009 the company announced its agreement to acquire guangdong jianlibao group co ltd’s jianlibao 65percent interest in a joint venture metal beverage can and end plant in sanshui prc ball has owned 35 percent of the joint venture plant since 1992 ball will acquire the plant and related net assets for approximately 90 million in cash and assumed debt and will also enter into a longterm supply agreement with jianlibao the transaction is expected to close in 2010 subject to customary regulatory approvals 

we are actively pursuing improved profitability through better asset utilization and cost optimization throughout the segment we are also committed to improving margins on this portion of our business through better commercial terms   we continue to focus efforts on the custom beverage can business specifically on cans of different shapes diameters and fill volumes and by developing cans with added functional attributes such as resealability and through product line extensions 

as part of our efforts to improve profitability we undertook various actions in 2009 and 2008 including the reduction of headcount in our metal beverage packaging business and the closures of our guayama puerto rico kansas city missouri and kent washington metal beverage container plants 

metal beverage packaging europe 

 

the metal beverage packaging europe segment includes metal beverage packaging products manufactured in europe ball packaging europe which represents an estimated 32 percent of total european metal beverage container shipments in 2009 excluding russia has manufacturing plants located in germany the united kingdom france the netherlands poland and serbia and is the second largest metal beverage container business in europe 

this segment accounted for 24 percent of consolidated net sales in 2009 25 percent in 2008 and 22 percent in 2007 segment sales in 2009 as compared to 2008 were 7 percent lower due to the translation impact of the euro to the us dollar partially offset by better commercial terms sales volumes in 2009 were essentially flat compared to those in the prior year segment sales in 2008 were 13 percent higher than in 2007 due largely to higher sales volumes of approximately 8 percent consistent with overall market growth higher sales prices and foreign currency gains of 8 percent on the strength of the euro these positive impacts were offset by certain small unfavorable cost changes including product mix changes towards smaller containers 

while 2009 sales volumes were consistent with the prior year the adverse effects of foreign currency translation both within europe and on the conversion of the euro to the us dollar reduced segment earnings by 8 million also contributing to lower segment earnings were higher cost inventory carried into 2009 and a change in sales mix partially offset by better commercial terms in some of our contracts earnings in 2008 were positively impacted by an increase in net margins of approximately 55 million due to the combined impact of the increased sales volumes and price recovery initiatives which exceeded the negative impact from product mix as well as approximately 20 million related to a stronger euro these improvements were partially offset by approximately 36 million of higher other costs including a negative foreign exchange impact from the conversion of the british pound to the euro and 35 million for business interruption recoveries in 2007 that were not repeated in 2008 for further details see below

in april 2006 a fire in the metal beverage can plant in hassloch germany damaged a significant portion of the building and machinery and equipment in 2007 the company recorded €376 million 486 million for insurance proceeds which were based on replacement cost and €272 million 351 million in cost of sales for insurance recoveries related to business interruption costs 

metal food and household products packaging americas 

 

 

the metal food and household products packaging americas segment consists of operations located in the us canada and argentina and includes the manufacture and sale of metal food cans aerosol cans paint cans general line cans and decorative specialty cans segment sales were 19 percent of consolidated net sales in 2009 16 percent in both 2008 and 2007 segment sales in 2009 increased 14 percent over 2008 due to higher selling prices driven by higher raw material costs beginning in 2009 which were partially offset by an 11 percent decrease in sales volume caused by the effects of the economic recession and ball’s decision to not pursue low margin business we estimate our 2009 shipments accounted for approximately 18 percent and 45 percent of total annual us and canadian steel food container and steel aerosol container shipments respectively segment sales in 2008 increased 3 percent compared to 2007 mostly due to higher selling prices offset by an approximate 3 percent decrease in sales volumes primarily as a result of decisions by management to discontinue low margin business which led to the announced closure of our commerce california and tallapoosa georgia facilities in 2007 

excluding the business consolidation activities for each period earnings in 2009 were 92 percent higher than in 2008 due primarily to the increased sales prices mentioned above coupled with 44 million of lower cost inventory carried into 2009 and 22 million of improvements in manufacturing performance partially offset by the lower sales volumes and a settlement gain of 7 million in 2008 not recurring in 2009 the 88 percent higher earnings in 2008 compared to 2007 were largely related to improved pricing better manufacturing performance and the 7 million settlement gain partially offset by the negative impact of 3 percent lower sales volumes in 2008 

as part of our efforts to improve profitability in this segment and to better align supply with customer demand we announced plans in october 2007 to close aerosol manufacturing plants in tallapoosa georgia and commerce california the commerce plant was closed in 2008 and the tallapoosa plant was closed in the first quarter of 2009 the cash costs of these actions are expected to be offset by proceeds on asset dispositions and tax recoveries 

plastic packaging americas 

 

 

  

page 23 of 97 

  

the plastic packaging americas segment consists of operations located in the us and canada through most of the third quarter of 2008 which manufacture pet and polypropylene plastic container products used mainly in beverage and food packaging as well as polypropylene containers for household product applications 

on october 23 2009 the company announced the sale of its plastic pail assets to bway corporation for approximately 32 million the transaction involved the sale of a plastic pail manufacturing plant in newnan georgia which ball acquired in 2006 as part of its purchase of us can corporation and associated contracts the plant produces injection molded plastic pails and drums for products such as building materials and pool chemicals the associated aftertax loss was insignificant 

this segment accounted for 9 percent of consolidated net sales in 2009 9 percent in 2008 and 10 percent in 2007 segment sales in 2009 were down 14 percent from sales in 2008 despite an increase in conversion sales prices an 11 percent decline in bottle sales volumes and a 15 percent reduction in preform sales volumes were the primary reasons for lower sales compared to 2008 other factors contributing to lower 2009 sales included resin price reductions and the previously mentioned disposition of the plastic pail assets segment sales in 2008 decreased 2 percent compared to 2007 due to a decrease of approximately 9 percent in sales volumes offset by higher raw material cost increases passed through to customers during 2008 the volume losses over the threeyear period included decreases in carbonated soft drink and water bottle sales due in part to lower convenience store sales by our customers the volume losses were partially offset by higher sales in specialty business markets which include custom hotfill alcohol food and juice drinks reduced preform sales also contributed to the sales decreases over the three years due in part to the bankruptcy filing of a preform customer in the second quarter of 2008 

excluding business consolidation charges and the pretax gain on sale of the plastic pail assets segment earnings in 2009 were slightly higher than in 2008 primarily due to higher selling prices and improved operating performance including benefits from a plant closure in the third quarter of 2008 and plant closures in the third quarter of 2009 offset by lower sales volumes segment earnings in 2008 were lower than in 2007 by approximately 40 percent primarily due to the previously mentioned volume losses and a 18 million charge due to a customer bankruptcy filing during the second quarter of 2008 in view of the low pet margins we continue to focus our efforts on price and margin recovery initiatives as well as pet development efforts in the custom hotfill beer wine flavored alcoholic beverage and specialty container markets in the polypropylene plastic container arena development efforts are primarily focused on custom packaging markets 

we estimate our 2009 shipments of pet plastic bottles to be approximately 8 percent of total us and canadian pet container shipments in addition the plastic packaging americas segment shipped approximately 625 million polypropylene food and specialty containers during 2009 

to improve cost performance and gain efficiencies in the third quarter of 2009 we closed pet plastic packaging manufacturing plants in watertown wisconsin and baldwinsville new york a plastic packaging manufacturing plant in brampton ontario was closed in the third quarter of 2008 

aerospace and technologies 

 

 

aerospace and technologies segment sales represented 9 percent of consolidated net sales in 2009 10 percent in 2008 and 11 percent in 2007 segment sales in 2009 were 8 percent lower than in 2008 driven by the delivery of several large spacecraft segment sales in 2008 were 5 percent lower as compared to 2007 as a result of a combination of large programs nearing completion program terminations delays in program awards and government funding constraints the reductions were partially offset by new program starts and increased scope on previously awarded contracts 

  

page 24 of 97 

  

some of the segment’s highprofile contracts include the james webb space telescope a successor to the hubble space telescope the spacebased space surveillance system which will detect and track space objects such as satellites and orbital debris npoess the nextgeneration satellite weather monitoring system and a number of antennas for the joint strike fighter during 2009 we shipped several large instrumentsspacecraft including kepler january ship march launch worldview 2 august ship october launch wise august ship december launch and participated in the latest hubble servicing mission in may this segment is also supporting the replacement of the current space shuttle program 

excluding the gain on the sale of an australian subsidiary bsg in 2008 earnings in 2009 were down 19 percent compared to 2008 primarily attributable to the winding down of several large programs and overall reduced program activity excluding the sale of bsg segment earnings in 2008 were up 18 percent in comparison to 2007 earnings improved in 2008 as the sales volume decline described above was more than offset by improved margins on contracts due to improvements in program execution risk retirement on several fixed price programs as well as a reduction of unreimbursable pension and benefit expenses 

on february 15 2008 ball completed the sale of its shares in bsg to qinetiq pty ltd for approximately 105 million including cash sold of 18 million the subsidiary provided services to the australian department of defense and related government agencies after an adjustment for working capital items the sale resulted in a pretax gain of 71 million 

sales to the us government either directly as a prime contractor or indirectly as a subcontractor represented 94 percent of segment sales in 2009 91 percent in 2008 and 84 percent in 2007 contracted backlog for the aerospace and technologies segment at december 31 2009 and 2008 was 518 million and 597 million respectively 

additional segment information 

for additional information regarding the company’s segments see the summary of business segment information in note 2 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report the charges recorded for business consolidation activities were based on estimates by ball management and were developed from information available at the time if actual outcomes vary from the estimates the differences will be reflected in current period earnings in the consolidated statement of earnings and identified as business consolidation gains and losses additional details about our business consolidation activities and associated costs are provided in note 6 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report 

undistributed corporate expenses net 

included in undistributed corporate expenses for 2009 was a 348 million gain 307 million after tax on the sale of a portion of our investment in digitalglobe a provider of commercial high resolution earth imagery products and services in conjunction with digitalglobe’s initial public offering the sale generated proceeds of 370 million in the second quarter of 2009 also included in 2009 was a charge of 111 million 67 million after tax for transaction costs associated with the ab inbev acquisition which in accordance with recent changes to the guidance related to accounting for business combinations are required to be expensed as incurred the transaction costs are included in the business consolidation and other activities line of the consolidated statement of earnings undistributed corporate expenses in 2008 included 115 million for marktomarket losses related to aluminum derivative instruments that were largely recovered in 2009 through customer contract arrangements 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative sga expenses were 3286 million 2882 million and 3237 million for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the increases in sga expenses in 2009 compared to 2008 were the result of approximately 31 million of higher employee compensation costs including incentive compensation costs and higher stockbased compensation costs including marktomarket adjustments for the company’s deferred compensation stock plans 13 million of gains in 2008 not recurring in 2009 including a 7 million claim settlement and 7 million of death benefit insurance proceeds and 8 million of unfavorable foreign currency exchange impacts these were offset by net favorable decreased costs of 12 million including lower receivables securitization fees legal expenses and research and development costs 

the decreases in sga expenses in 2008 compared to 2007 were due to approximately 8 million of lower general and administrative costs as a result of the sale in february 2008 of bsg lower aerospace research and development costs and bid and proposal costs of 4 million life insurance death benefits of 7 million the settlement of a claim for 7 million the favorable net yearoveryear change in foreign currency hedges and exchange impacts of 13 million and other miscellaneous net cost reductions

interest and taxes 

consolidated interest expense was 1172 million in 2009 1377 million in 2008 and 1494 million in 2007 the lower expense in 2009 was primarily due to lower interest rates on floating rate debt partially offset by additional interest associated with the issuance of 700 million of new senior notes in august 2009 the reduced expense in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to lower interest rates on floating rate debt as us and european central banks cut interest rates amid the global financial crisis 

based on current estimates the 2010 effective income tax rate is expected to be approximately 33 percent ball’s consolidated effective income tax rate for 2009 was 303 percent compared to 326 percent in 2008 and 263 percent in 2007 the lower tax rate in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to a 4 million net increase in tax benefits as a result of a foreign tax settlement legislative changes and a release of a valuation allowance for a net operating loss carryforward a 6 million tax benefit from the sale of shares in a stock investment and other assets due to a higher tax basis and a favorable change of 11 million in the provision for uncertain tax positions due to tax settlements in several foreign jurisdictions these benefits were offset somewhat by an increase due to the change in our earnings mix to higher taxed jurisdictions lower research and development tax credits and a decrease in the benefit of lower tax rates in foreign tax jurisdictions coupled with increased withholding taxes 

the lower tax rate in 2007 as compared to 2008 was primarily the result of earnings mix higher foreign earnings taxed at lower rates and net tax benefit adjustments of 17 million recorded in 2007 additionally the inability to fully use canadian net operating losses on plant closures in 2008 contributed to a higher effective tax rate the 2008 rate was partially reduced by a 45 million tax benefit recognized during the third quarter of 2008 for an enacted tax law change in the united kingdom which was offset by the impact of nondeductible losses in the cash surrender value of certain companyowned life insurance plans the 17 million net reduction in the 2007 tax provision was primarily a result of enacted income tax rate reductions in germany and the united kingdom and a tax loss related to the company’s canadian operations which were offset by an increase in the tax provision for uncertain tax positions in 2007 to adjust for the final settlement negotiations concluded with the internal revenue service irs related to a companyowned life insurance plan discussed below 

during 2007 the company concluded final settlement negotiations with the irs on the deductibility of interest expense on incurred loans from a companyowned life insurance plan an additional accrual of 70 million was made in the third quarter of 2007 to adjust the accrued liability to the final settlement of 184 million including interest for the years 2000 through 2006 this settlement included agreement on the prospective treatment of interest deductibility on the policy loans which has not had a significant impact on earnings per share cash flow or liquidity further details are available in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report 

results of equity affiliates 

equity in the earnings of affiliates is primarily attributable to our 50 percent ownership in packaging investments in the us and brazil earnings were 138 million in 2009 145 million in 2008 and 129 million in 2007 

critical and significant accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements 

for information regarding the company’s critical and significant accounting policies as well as recent accounting pronouncements see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows and capital expenditures 

liquidity 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities and external committed borrowings we believe that cash flows from operations and cash provided by shortterm and committed revolver borrowings when necessary will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements scheduled principal and interest payments on debt dividend payments and anticipated capital expenditures we had in excess of 600 million of available funds under committed multicurrency revolving credit facilities at december 31 2009 

  

page 26 of 97 

  

cash flows provided by operations were 5597 million in 2009 compared to 6276 million in 2008 and 673 million in 2007 lower operating cash flows in 2009 compared to 2008 were the result of working capital increases and higher pension funding and income tax payments during the year the reduction in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily due to the payment of approximately 70 million in january 2008 of a legal settlement to a customer this reduction was partially offset by the net impact of increases in net earnings and depreciation lower tax payments lower pension contributions and a net increase in working capital during the year 

financial instrument collateral 

in our worldwide beverage can business we use financial derivative contracts as discussed in “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” within item 7a of this report to manage certain future aluminum price volatility for our customers as these derivative contracts are matched to customer sales contracts they have little or no economic impact on our earnings our agreements with our financial counterparties require us to post collateral in certain circumstances when the negative marktomarket value of the contracts exceeds specified levels additionally ball has similar collateral posting arrangements with certain customers on these derivative contracts the cash flows of the collateral postings are shown within the investing section of our consolidated statements of cash flows at december 31 2009 ball had 142 million of cash posted as collateral which was offset by cash collateral receipts from customers of 142 million at december 31 2008 ball had 2295 million of cash posted as collateral and had received 1240 million of cash from customers for a net amount of 1055 million 

 

management performance measures 

the following financial measurements are on a nonus gaap basis and should be considered in connection with the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report nonus gaap measures should not be considered in isolation and should not be considered superior to or a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with us gaap a presentation of earnings in accordance with us gaap is available in item 8 of this report 

free cash flow 

management internally uses a free cash flow measure 1 to evaluate the company’s operating results 2 to plan stock buyback levels 3 to evaluate strategic investments and 4 to evaluate the company’s ability to incur and service debt free cash flow is not a defined term under us generally accepted accounting principles and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures the company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less additions to property plant and equipment capital spending free cash flow is typically derived directly from the company’s cash flow statements however it may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods in 2007 we adjusted free cash flow to reflect our decision to contribute an additional 445 million 273 million after tax to our pension plans and to include the property insurance proceeds used to fund the replacement of the firedamaged assets in our hassloch germany plant 

 

based on the above definition our consolidated free cash flow is summarized as follows 

 

there were no reconciling items to cash flows from investing or financing activities as reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows within item 8 of this report 

based on information currently available we estimate cash flows from operating activities for 2010 to be approximately 735 million capital spending to be approximately 235 million and free cash flow to be in the 500 million range these estimates do not reflect that under new accounting guidance effective january 1 2010 our accounts receivable securitization program will likely be recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and the related activity shown in our consolidated cash flow statement as a financing activity rather than as an operating activity in 2010 we intend to allocate our operating cash flow to reducing our debt and growing our cash balances while increasing our stock repurchases and covering our capital spending programs

ebit and ebitda 

management internally uses adjusted earnings before interest and taxes adjusted ebit and adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda to evaluate the companys performance ebit and ebitda are typically derived directly from the company’s consolidated statement of earnings however they may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods management also uses interest coverage and net debt to adjusted ebitda ratios as metrics to monitor our credit quality 

based on the above definitions our calculation of adjusted ebit adjusted ebitda interest coverage ratio and net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio are summarized below 

 

debt facilities and refinancing 

interestbearing debt at december 31 2009 increased 1861 million to 26 billion from 24 billion at december 31 2008 the relatively small debt increase from 2008 was achieved despite our issuance of 700 million of new senior notes on august 20 2009 

at december 31 2009 663 million was available under our multicurrency revolving credit facilities these committed credit facilities are available until october 2011 we also had 305 million of shortterm uncommitted credit facilities available at the end of the year on which 635 million was outstanding 

given our free cash flow projections and unused credit facilities that are available until october 2011 our liquidity is strong and is expected to meet our ongoing operating cash flow and debt service requirements while the recent financial and economic conditions have raised concerns about credit risk with counterparties to derivative transactions the company mitigates its exposure by spreading the risk among various counterparties and limiting exposure to any one party we also monitor the credit ratings of our suppliers customers lenders and counterparties on a regular basis 

the financial and economic environment has exacerbated liquidity and credit risks with some of our customers and suppliers in october 2008 we advanced interestbearing funding of 22 million in support of one of our key suppliers which advance is secured by accounts receivable and inventory at december 31 2009 the amount advanced was included in accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheet included within item 8 of this report

we were in compliance with all loan agreements at december 31 2009 and all prior years presented and have met all debt payment obligations the us note agreements bank credit agreement and industrial development revenue bond agreements contain certain restrictions relating to dividends investments financial ratios guarantees and the incurrence of additional indebtedness additional details about our debt and receivables sales agreements are available in notes 15 and 8 respectively accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report 

accounts receivable securitization 

we have a receivables sales agreement that provides for the ongoing revolving sale of a designated pool of trade accounts receivable of ball’s north american packaging operations up to 250 million the agreement qualifies as offbalance sheet financing under accounting guidance in effect through december 31 2009 net funds received from the sale of the accounts receivable totaled 250 million at both december 31 2009 and 2008 and are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets under new accounting guidance that will be effective as of january 1 2010 it is likely that the sold accounts receivable will remain on our consolidated balance sheet resulting in a corresponding increase in debt this will create a onetime reduction in cash flows from operating activities in 2010 and an offsetting onetime increase in cash flows from financing activities 

other liquidity items 

cash payments required for longterm debt maturities rental payments under noncancellable operating leases purchase obligations and other commitments in effect at december 31 2009 are summarized in the following table 

 

 

 

 

contributions to the company’s defined benefit pension plans not including the unfunded german plans are expected to be in the range of 55 million in 2010 this estimate may change based on changes in the pension protection act and actual plan asset performance among other factors benefit payments related to these plans are expected to be 78 million 80 million 83 million 87 million and 91 million for the years ending december 31 2010 through 2014 respectively and a total of 520 million for the years 2015 through 2019 payments to participants in the unfunded german plans are expected to be approximately 24 million to 25 million in each of the years 2010 through 2014 and a total of 113 million for the years 2015 through 2019 

for the us pension plans in 2010 we intend to maintain our current return on asset assumption of 825 percent and to change our discount rate assumption to 600 percent from 625 percent in 2009 based on these assumptions us pension expense for 2010 is anticipated to increase approximately 5 million compared to 2009 expense of 481 million most of which will be included in cost of sales pension expense in europe and canada combined is expected to be higher than the 2009 expense of 258 million by approximately 2 million a reduction of the expected return on pension assets assumption by one quarter of a percentage point would result in an estimated 27 million increase in the 2010 pension expense while a quarter of a percentage point reduction in the discount rate applied to the pension liability would result in an estimated 32 million of additional pension expense in 2010 additional information regarding the company’s pension plans is provided in note 17 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend 

financial instruments and risk management 

in the ordinary course of business we employ established risk management policies and procedures which seek to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices interest rates foreign currencies and prices of the company’s common stock in respect of common share repurchases although there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be successful although the instruments utilized involve varying degrees of credit market and interest risk the counterparties to the agreements are expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements the company monitors counterparty credit risk including that of its lenders on a regular basis but we cannot be certain that all risks will be discerned or that our risk management policies and procedures will always be effective 

we have estimated our market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis market risk exposure has been defined as the changes in fair value of derivative instruments financial instruments and commodity positions to test the sensitivity of our market risk exposure we have estimated the changes in fair value of market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in market prices or rates the results of the sensitivity analyses are summarized below 

commodity price risk 

we manage our north american commodity price risk in connection with market price fluctuations of aluminum ingot primarily by entering into container sales contracts that include aluminum ingotbased pricing terms that generally reflect price fluctuations under our commercial supply contracts for aluminum sheet purchases the terms include fixed floating or passthrough aluminum ingot component pricing this matched pricing affects most of our north american metal beverage packaging net sales we also at times use certain derivative instruments such as option and forward contracts as cash flow hedges of commodity price risk where there is not a passthrough arrangement in the sales contract to match underlying purchase volumes and pricing with sales volumes and pricing 

most of the plastic packaging americas sales contracts include provisions to fully pass through resin cost changes as a result we believe we have minimal exposure related to changes in the cost of plastic resin most metal food and household products packaging americas sales contracts either include provisions permitting us to pass through some or all steel cost changes we incur or they incorporate annually negotiated steel costs in 2009 and in 2008 we were able to pass through to our customers the majority of the steel cost increases we anticipate at this time that we will be able to pass through the majority of the steel price increases that occur in 2010 

in europe and the prc the company manages the aluminum and steel raw material commodity price risks through annual and longterm contracts for the purchase of the materials as well as certain sales of containers that reduce the companys exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices within the current year these contracts include fixed price floating andor passthrough pricing arrangements we also use forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges to manage future aluminum price risk and foreign exchange exposures to match underlying purchase volumes and pricing with sales volumes and pricing for those sales contracts where there is not a passthrough arrangement to minimize the company’s exposure to significant price changes 

considering the effects of derivative instruments the company’s ability to pass through certain raw material costs through contractual provisions the market’s ability to accept price increases and the company’s commodity price exposures under its contract terms a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the company’s steel aluminum and resin prices could result in an estimated 35 million aftertax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period additionally if foreign currency exchange rates were to change adversely by 10 percent we estimate there could be a 123 million aftertax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period for foreign currency exposures on raw materials actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates 

the company is also exposed to fluctuations in prices for natural gas and electricity as well as the cost of diesel fuel as a component of freight cost a hypothetical 10 percent increase in our natural gas and electricity prices could result in an estimated 50 million aftertax reduction of net earnings over a oneyear period a hypothetical 10 percent increase in diesel fuel prices could result in an estimated 23 million aftertax reduction of net earnings over the same period actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates 

  

page 32 of 97 

  

interest rate risk 

our objective in managing our exposure to interest rate changes is to minimize the impact of such changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we use a variety of interest rate swaps collars and options to manage our mix of floating and fixedrate debt interest rate instruments held by the company at december 31 2009 included payfixed interest rate swaps and interest rate collars payfixed swaps effectively convert variable rate obligations to fixed rate instruments collars create an upper and lower threshold within which interest rates will fluctuate 

based on our interest rate exposure at december 31 2009 assumed floating rate debt levels throughout the next 12 months and the effects of derivative instruments a 100basis point increase in interest rates could result in an estimated 51 million aftertax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates and the timing of these changes 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to protect foreign cash flows and earnings from changes associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes through the use of various derivative contracts in addition we manage foreign earnings translation volatility through the use of various foreign currency option strategies and the change in the fair value of those options is recorded in the company’s earnings our foreign currency translation risk results from the european euro british pound canadian dollar polish zloty chinese renminbi hong kong dollar brazilian real argentine peso and serbian dinar we face currency exposures in our global operations as a result of purchasing raw materials in us dollars and to a lesser extent in other currencies sales contracts are negotiated with customers to reflect cost changes and where there is not a foreign exchange passthrough arrangement the company uses forward and option contracts to manage foreign currency exposures we additionally use various option strategies to manage the earnings translation of the company’s european operations into us dollars 

considering the company’s derivative financial instruments outstanding at december 31 2009 and the currency exposures a hypothetical 10 percent reduction us dollar strengthening in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the us dollar could result in an estimated 275 million aftertax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period this amount includes the 123 million currency exposure discussed above in the “commodity price risk” section this hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would also reduce our forecasted average debt balance by 573 million actual changes in market prices or rates may differ from hypothetical changes 

equity price risk 

the company’s deferred compensation stock program is subject to variable accounting and accordingly is marked to market using the company’s closing stock price at the end of a reporting period based on current share levels in the program each 1 change in the company’s stock price has an effect of 08 million on pretax earnings as a way to partially reduce cash flow and earnings volatility as well as stock price changes associated with our deferred compensation stock program from time to time the company sells equity put options on its common stock marktomarket accounting applies to these equity put options approximately 32 million of income was included in 2009 earnings to record the variance between the historical fair value and the current market value of outstanding equity put options all of the outstanding options expired without value during august 2009

our reporting segments 

ball corporation reports its financial performance in   five reportable segments organized along a combination of product lines after aggregating operating segments that have similar economic characteristics 1 metal beverage packaging americas and asia 2 metal beverage packaging europe 3 metal food and household products packaging americas 4 plastic packaging americas and 5 aerospace and technologies we also have investments in companies in the us the prc and brazil which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and accordingly those results are not included in segment sales or earnings due to first quarter 2008 management reporting changes ball’s operations in the prc with 2008 net sales of 2896 million are now aggregated and included in the metal beverage packaging americas and asia segment previously included within the company’s european operations prior periods required to be shown in this annual report on form 10k annual report have been conformed to the current presentation 

profitability is sensitive to selling prices production volumes labor transportation utility and warehousing costs as well as the availability and price of raw materials such as aluminum sheet tinplate steel plastic resin and other direct materials these raw materials are generally available from several sources and we have secured what we consider to be adequate supplies and are not experiencing any shortages there has been significant consolidation of suppliers in both north america and in europe raw materials and energy sources such as natural gas and electricity may from time to time be in short supply or unavailable due to external factors and the pass through of steel and aluminum costs to our customers may be limited in some instances we cannot predict the timing or effects if any of such occurrences on future operations 

a substantial part of ball’s packaging sales are made directly to companies in packaged beverage and food businesses including sabmiller plc and bottlers of pepsicola and cocacola branded beverages and their affiliates that utilize consolidated purchasing groups additional details about sales to major customers are included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements which can be found in item 8 of this annual report financial statements and supplementary data 

metal beverage packaging americas and asia segment 

industry background and ball’s operations 

according to publicly available information and company estimates the combined us and canada metal beverage container markets decreased in 2008 to 101 billion units from 105 billion units in 2007 five companies manufacture substantially all of the metal beverage containers in the us and canada two of these producers and three other independent producers also manufacture metal beverage containers in mexico ball produced in excess of 30 billion recyclable beverage cans in the us and canada in 2008 – about 30 percent of the total market sales volumes of metal beverage containers in north america tend to be highest during the period from april through september all of the beverage cans produced by ball in the us and canada are made of aluminum as are all beverage cans produced by our competitors in the us canada and mexico in 2008 we were able to pass through substantially all aluminumrelated cost increases levied by producers in north america four aluminum suppliers provide virtually all of our requirements some of those aluminum suppliers have experienced significant financial and liquidity constraints in recent years which may be exacerbated by the global economic crisis 

we believe we have limited our exposure related to changes in the costs of aluminum sheet as a result of the inclusion of provisions in most aluminum container sales contracts to pass through aluminum cost changes as well as the use of derivative instruments 

beverage containers are sold in a highly competitive market based on quality service and price which is relatively capital intensive and is characterized by plants that run more or less continuously in order to operate profitably in addition the aluminum beverage can competes aggressively with other packaging materials the glass bottle has shown resilience in the packaged beer industry while the pet container has grown significantly in the carbonated soft drink and water industries over the past quarter century in canada metal beverage containers have captured significantly lower percentages of packaged beverage industry volumes than in the us particularly in the packaged beer industry 

  

page 2 of 96 

  

metal beverage packaging americas and asia is ball’s largest segment accounting for 40 percent of consolidated net sales in 2008 metal beverage containers are primarily sold under multiyear supply contracts to fillers of carbonated soft drinks beer energy drinks and other beverages decorated twopiece aluminum beverage cans are produced at 14 manufacturing facilities in the us and one in canada can ends are produced within two of the us facilities as well as in a third facility that manufactures only ends through rocky mountain metal container llc a 5050 joint venture which is accounted for as an equity investment ball and millercoors llc operate beverage can and end manufacturing facilities in golden colorado on july 1 2008 the us and puerto rico businesses of coors brewing company coors and our largest north american brewery customer miller brewing company miller were combined to form millercoors llc 

the beverage can market in the prc is approximately 12 billion cans of which ball’s operations represent an estimated 22 percent with an additional 13 percent manufactured by two joint ventures in which we participate our percentage of the industry makes us one of the largest manufacturers of beverage cans in the prc six other manufacturers make up the remainder of the market our operations include the manufacture of aluminum cans and ends in three plants in the prc as well as in our two joint ventures we also manufacture and sell highdensity plastic containers in two prc plants primarily servicing the motor oil industry capacity grew rapidly in the prc in the late 1990s resulting in a supplydemand imbalance a number of can makers including ball responded by rationalizing capacity demand growth has resumed over the past several years and we expect the prc market to continue to grow over time after the effects of the current global economic crisis begin to dissipate 

we participate in a 5050 joint venture in brazil latapackball embalagens ltda that manufactures aluminum cans and ends and is accounted for as an equity investment the brazilian joint venture is expanding capacity at its existing facility near sao paulo and is building a new plant near rio de janeiro 

in order to more closely balance capacity and demand within our business during 2008 ball announced or completed the closure of three metal beverage packaging plants in north america 

 

 

where growth is projected in certain markets or for certain products ball is undertaking selected capacity increases in its existing facilities and may establish or obtain additional manufacturing capacity to the extent required by the growth of any of the markets we serve 

metal beverage packaging europe segment 

industry background and ball’s operations 

the european beverage can market is approximately 55 billion cans or more than half the size of the north american beverage can market while current economic conditions have slowed growth in the near term the european market is expected to grow and is highly regional in terms of growth and packaging mix growth in central and eastern europe has been particularly strong in recent years but has been impacted by the recent economic downturn causing the company to delay completion of its new plant in lublin poland western markets including the united kingdom and france continue to hold up on a relative basis 

  

page 3 of 96 

  

sales volumes of metal beverage containers in europe tend to be highest during the period from may through august with a smaller increase in demand during the winter holiday season for the united kingdom as in north america the metal beverage container competes aggressively with other packaging materials used by the european beer and carbonated soft drink industries the glass bottle is heavily utilized in the packaged beer industry while the pet container is increasingly utilized in the carbonated soft drink juice and mineral water industries 

ball packaging europe is the second largest metal beverage container producer in europe with an estimated 29 percent of european shipments and supplies twopiece beverage cans and can ends for producers of beer carbonated soft drinks mineral water fruit juices energy drinks and other beverages 

the metal beverage packaging europe segment which accounted for 25 percent of ball’s consolidated net sales in 2008 consists of 10 beverage can plants and two beverage can end plants in europe of the 12 european plants four are located in germany three in the united kingdom two in france and one each in the netherlands poland and serbia in addition ball packaging europe is currently renting additional space on the premises of a supplier in haslach germany in order to produce the ball resealable end bre the european plants produced approximately 16 billion cans in 2008 with approximately 56 percent of those being produced from aluminum and 44 percent from steel six of the can plants use aluminum and four use steel 

ball announced plans in january 2008 to build a new beverage can manufacturing plant in poland in order to meet the rapidly growing demand for beverage cans there and elsewhere in central and eastern europe the plant is being built in lublin which is in eastern poland near the borders of belarus and ukraine it will initially have one production line with an annual capacity of approximately 750 million cans per year however due to the recent global economic downturn we will delay the completion of the plant until market conditions warrant such startup in addition we are delaying construction of our planned beverage can plant in india due to current economic conditions in that country 

european raw material supply contracts are generally for a period of one year although ball packaging europe has negotiated some longer term agreements in europe three steel suppliers and four aluminum suppliers provide approximately 95 percent of our requirements aluminum is purchased primarily in us dollars while the functional currencies of ball packaging europe and its subsidiaries are nonus dollars the company generally tries to minimize the resulting foreign exchange rate risk through the use of derivative contracts in addition purchase and sales contracts include fixed price floating and passthrough pricing arrangements

the metal food and household products packaging americas segment competes primarily in the steel tinplate food and aerosol can markets in north america the steel tinplate food can market consists of approximately 31 billion cans annually of which about 43 percent are threepiece cans and 57 percent are twopiece cans the steel tinplate aerosol can market is approximately 32 billion cans annually we anticipate slight growth in the aerosol market while the food market is expected to be essentially flat over time 

sales volumes of metal food containers in north america tend to be highest from may through october as a result of seasonal fruit vegetable and salmon packs we estimate our 2008 shipments of more than 56 billion steel food containers to be approximately 19 percent of total us and canadian metal food container shipments we estimate our aerosol business accounts for approximately 50 percent of total annual us and canadian steel aerosol shipments 

competitors in the metal food container product line include two national and a small number of regional suppliers and self manufacturers several producers in mexico also manufacture steel food containers competition in the us steel aerosol can market primarily includes two national suppliers steel containers also compete with other packaging materials in the food and household products industry including glass aluminum plastic paper and the standup pouch as a result demand for this product line is dependent on product innovation and cost reduction service quality and price are among the other key competitive factors in north america two steel suppliers provide more than 70 percent of our tinplate steel some steel suppliers have experienced significant financial and liquidity constraints in recent years which may be exacerbated by the global economic crisis we believe we have limited our exposure related to changes in the costs of steel tinplate as a result of the inclusion of provisions in

certain steel container sales contracts to pass through steel cost changes and the existence of certain other steel container sales contracts that incorporate annually negotiated metal costs in 2008 we were able to pass through the majority of steel cost increases levied by producers 

the metal food and household products packaging americas segment accounted for 16 percent of consolidated net sales in 2008 the two major product lines in this segment are steel food and aerosol containers ball produces twopiece and threepiece steel food containers and ends for packaging vegetables fruit soups meat seafood nutritional products pet food and other products these containers and ends are manufactured in nine plants in the us and canada and sold primarily to food processors in north america 

the segment also manufactures and sells aerosol cans paint cans and custom and specialty containers in eight plants in the us and is the largest manufacturer of aerosol cans in north america in addition the company manufactures and sells aerosol cans in two plants in argentina 

in october 2007 as part of a restructuring of ball’s metal food and household products packaging americas segment ball announced plans to close aerosol container manufacturing plants in tallapoosa georgia and commerce california ball closed the commerce facility during the third quarter of 2008 and closed the tallapoosa facility in january 2009 the two plant closures result in a net reduction in manufacturing capacity of 10 production lines including the relocation of two highspeed aerosol lines into existing ball facilities and allow us to supply customers from a consolidated asset base these actions are expected to yield annual pretax cost savings in excess of 15 million in 2009 and improve aerosol plant manufacturing utilization to more than 85 percent from about 70 percent 

also in october 2007 ball announced its intention to exit the custom and decorative tinplate can business based in its baltimore maryland manufacturing plant during 2008 it was determined based on market conditions that we would remain in that business 

plastic packaging americas segment 

industry background and ball’s operations 

demand for containers made of pet and polypropylene has slowed in the beverage and food markets due to current economic conditions while pet and polypropylene beverage containers compete against metal glass and cardboard the historical increase in the sales of pet containers has come primarily at the expense of glass containers and through new market introductions 

competition in the pet plastic container industry is intense and includes several national and regional suppliers and self manufacturers in the smaller polypropylene container industry ball is one of three major competitors service quality and price are important competitive factors with price being by far the most important resulting in poor margins for most of the industry the ability to produce customized differentiated plastic containers is also a key competitive factor we believe we have limited our exposure related to changes in the costs of plastic resin as a result of the inclusion of provisions in substantially all plastic container sales contracts to pass through resin cost changes 

plastic packaging americas accounted for 9 percent of ball’s consolidated net sales in 2008 we estimate our 2008 shipments of 55 billion plastic bottles to be approximately 10 percent of total us pet container shipments in addition this segment shipped approximately 750 million polypropylene food and specialty containers during 2008 the company operates eight plastic container manufacturing facilities in the us 

most of ball’s pet containers are sold under longterm contracts to suppliers of bottled water and carbonated soft drinks including bottlers of pepsicola branded beverages and their affiliates that utilize consolidated purchasing groups most of our polypropylene containers are also sold under longterm contracts primarily to food packaging companies plastic beer containers are being produced for several of our customers and we are manufacturing plastic containers for the singleserve juice and wine markets our line of heattek® pet plastic bottles for hotfilled beverages such as sports drinks and juices includes sizes from 8 ounces to 64 ounces 

  

page 5 of 96 

  

ball’s emphasis in this segment is on customized differentiated containers this includes unique barrier plastics such as gamma® gammaclear® amazonhm® and khs corpoplast gmbh plasmax® barrier bottles the company is not investing in the carbonated soft drink and bottled water business which is a commodity business where return on investment has been unacceptable 

on june 26 2008 ball announced the closure of a plastic packaging manufacturing plant in brampton ontario which ceased operations in the third quarter of 2008 the brampton operations have been consolidated into the company’s other plastic packaging manufacturing facilities in the united states and the closure of this facility is expected to result in annual fixedcost savings of approximately 4 million beginning in 2009 

aerospace and technologies segment 

ball’s aerospace and technologies segment which accounted for 10 percent of consolidated net sales in 2008 includes national defense antenna and video technologies civil and operational space and systems engineering solutions businesses the segment develops spacecraft sensors and instruments radio frequency systems and other advanced technologies for the civil commercial and national security aerospace markets the majority of the aerospace and technologies business involves work under contracts generally from one to five years in duration as a prime contractor or subcontractor for the national aeronautics and space administration nasa the us department of defense dod and other us government agencies contracts funded by the various agencies of the federal government represented 91 percent of segment sales in 2008 

geopolitical events shifting executive and legislative branch priorities funding shortfalls combined with increased competition for new business have resulted in a decline in opportunities in areas matching ball’s aerospace and technologies segment’s core capabilities in space hardware although we have seen declines in our space hardware opportunities our traditional strength we have seen growth in opportunities related to our services and tactical components the businesses include hardware software and services sold primarily to us customers with emphasis on space science and exploration environmental and earth sciences and defense and intelligence applications major contractual activities frequently involve the design manufacture and testing of satellites remote sensors and ground station control hardware and software as well as related services such as launch vehicle integration and satellite operations 

other hardware activities include target identification warning and attitude control systems and components cryogenic systems for reactant storage and sensor cooling devices using either closedcycle mechanical refrigerators or opencycle solid and liquid cryogens star trackers which are generalpurpose stellar attitude sensors and faststeering mirrors additionally the aerospace and technologies segment provides diversified technical services and products to government agencies prime contractors and commercial organizations for a broad range of information warfare electronic warfare avionics intelligence training and space systems needs 

backlog in the aerospace and technologies segment was 597 million and 774 million at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively and consists of the aggregate contract value of firm orders excluding amounts previously recognized as revenue the 2008 backlog includes 378 million expected to be recognized in revenues during 2009 with the remainder expected to be recognized in revenues thereafter unfunded amounts included in backlog for certain firm government orders which are subject to annual funding were 309 million and 463 million at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively yeartoyear comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations 

on february 15 2008 the segment completed the sale of its shares in ball solutions group pty ltd bsg to qinetiq pty ltd for approximately 105 million including cash sold of 18 million bsg was previously a wholly owned australian subsidiary that provided services to the australian department of defense and related government agencies after an adjustment for working capital items the sale resulted in a pretax gain of 71 million 

ball’s aerospace and technologies segment has contracts with the us government or its contractors that have standard termination provisions the government retains the right to terminate contracts at its convenience however if contracts are terminated in this manner ball is entitled to reimbursement for allowable costs and profits on authorized work performed through the date of termination us government contracts are also subject to reduction or modification in the event of changes in government requirements or budgetary constraints

patents 

in the opinion of the company none of its active patents is essential to the successful operation of its business as a whole 

research and development 

research and development rd efforts in the north american packaging segments as well as in the european metal beverage container business are primarily directed toward packaging innovation specifically the development of new sizes and types of containers as well as new uses for the current containers other rd efforts in these segments seek to improve manufacturing efficiencies our north american packaging rd activities are primarily conducted in the ball technology  innovation center btic located in westminster colorado the european rd activities are primarily conducted in a technical center located in bonn germany 

in our aerospace business we continue to focus our rd activities on the design development and manufacture of innovative aerospace systems this includes the production of spacecraft instruments and sensors radio frequency and microwave technologies data exploitation solutions and a variety of advanced aerospace technologies and products that enable deep space missions our aerospace rd activities are conducted in various locations in the us 

note 23 research and development in the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report contains information on company research and development activity additional information is also included in item 2 “properties” 

sustainability and the environment 

throughout our company’s history we have focused on sustainability and the environment in all aspects of our businesses and recently have formalized our initiatives in light of the current environment we continue to make progress on the sustainability goals stated in the sustainability report we issued on june 30 2008 we have committed to formally report on the status of our sustainability efforts in 2010 

key issues for our company include reducing our use of electricity and natural gas reducing waste and increasing recycling at our facilities analyzing and reducing our water consumption reducing our existing volatile organic compounds and further improving safety performance in our facilities 

the 2007 recycling rate in the united states for aluminum cans was 54 percent the highest recycling rate for any beverage container according to the most recently published data the aluminum can sheet we buy contains an average of 41 percent post consumer recycled content and approximately 9 percent post industrial content reducing the amount of virgin material to 50 percent 

recycling rates vary throughout europe but average around 60 percent for aluminum and steel containers which exceeds the european union’s goal of 50 percent recycling for metals due in part to the intrinsic value of aluminum and steel metal packaging recycling rates in europe compare favorably to those of other packaging materials ball’s european operations help establish and financially support recycling initiatives in growing markets such as poland and serbia to educate consumers about the benefits of recycling aluminum and steel cans and to increase recycling rates we have also initiated a similar program in china to educate consumers in that market regarding the benefits of recycling 

compliance with federal state and local laws relating to protection of the environment has not had a material adverse effect upon the capital expenditures earnings or competitive position of the company as more fully described under item 3 “legal proceedings” the us environmental protection agency and various state environmental agencies have designated the company as a potentially responsible party along with numerous other companies for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites however the company’s information at this time indicates that these matters will not have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity results of operations or financial condition of the company 

  

page 7 of 96 

  

legislation that would prohibit tax or restrict the sale or use of certain types of containers or would require diversion of solid wastes including packaging materials from disposal in landfills has been or may be introduced anywhere we operate while container legislation has been adopted in some jurisdictions similar legislation has been defeated in public referenda and legislative bodies in numerous others the company anticipates that continuing efforts will be made to consider and adopt such legislation in many jurisdictions in the future if such legislation were widely adopted it could potentially have a material adverse effect on the business of the company including its liquidity results of operations or financial condition as well as on the container manufacturing industry generally in view of the company’s substantial global sales and investment in metal and pet container manufacturing however the packages we produce are widely used and perform well in us states canadian provinces and european countries that have deposit systems 

employee relations 

at the end of 2008 the company employed approximately 10400 employees in the us and 4100 in other countries an additional 1000 people were employed in unconsolidated joint ventures in which ball participates 

approximately 30 percent of balls north american packaging plant employees are unionized and most of our european plant employees are union workers collective bargaining agreements with various unions in the us have terms of three to five years and those in europe have terms of one to two years the agreements expire at regular intervals and are customarily renewed in the ordinary course after bargaining between union and company representatives the company believes that its employee relations are good and that its safety training education and retention practices assist in enhancing employee satisfaction levels

 item 1a risk factors 

any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the loss of a key customer or a reduction in its requirements could have a significant negative impact on our sales 

while we have diversified our customer base we do sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major beverage packaged food and household product companies some of which operate in north america south america europe and asia 

although approximately 65 percent of our customer contracts are longterm these contracts are terminable under certain circumstances such as our failure to meet quality or volume requirements because we depend on relatively few major customers our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss of any of these customers a reduction in the purchasing levels of these customers a strike or work stoppage by a significant number of these customers employees or an adverse change in the terms of the supply agreements with these customers 

the primary customers for our aerospace segment are us government agencies or their prime contractors these sales represented approximately 9 percent of balls consolidated 2008 net sales our contracts with these customers are subject to several risks including funding cuts and delays technical uncertainties budget changes competitive activity and changes in scope 

we face competitive risks from many sources that may negatively impact our profitability 

competition within the packaging industry is intense increases in productivity combined with existing or potential surplus capacity in the industry have maintained competitive pricing pressures the principal methods of competition in the general packaging industry are price service and quality some of our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources our current or potential competitors may offer products at a lower price or products that are deemed superior to ours the current global economic crisis may result in reductions in demand for our products which in turn could increase these competitive pressures 

we are subject to competition from alternative products which could result in lower profits and reduced cash flows 

our metal packaging products are subject to significant competition from substitute products particularly plastic carbonated soft drink bottles made from pet single serve beer bottles and other food and beverage containers made of glass cardboard or other materials competition from plastic carbonated soft drink bottles is particularly intense in the united states and the united kingdom certain of our aerospace products are also subject to competition from alternative solutions there can be no assurance that our products will successfully compete against alternative products which could result in a reduction in our profits or cash flow 

we have a narrow product range and our business would suffer if usage of our products decreased 

for the 12 months ended december 31 2008 65 percent of our consolidated net sales were from the sale of metal beverage cans and we expect to derive a significant portion of our future revenues from the sale of metal beverage cans our business would suffer if the use of metal beverage cans decreased accordingly broad acceptance by consumers of aluminum and steel cans for a wide variety of beverages is critical to our future success if demand for glass and pet bottles increases relative to cans or the demand for aluminum and steel cans does not develop as expected our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

  

page 9 of 96 

  

our business financial condition and results of operations are subject to risks resulting from increased international operations 

we derived 31 percent of our consolidated net sales from outside of the us for the year ended december 31 2008 this sizeable scope of international operations may lead to more volatile financial results and make it more difficult for us to manage our business reasons for this include but are not limited to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any of these factors some of which are also present in the us could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations 

for the 12 months ended december 31 2008 73 percent of our consolidated net sales were attributable to operations with the us dollar as their functional currency 15 percent with the euro as the functional currency and 12 percent were attributable to operations having functional currencies other than the us dollar or the euro 

our reporting currency is the us dollar historically balls foreign operations including assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses have been denominated in various currencies other than the us dollar and we expect that our foreign operations will continue to be so denominated as a result the us dollar value of balls foreign operations has varied and will continue to vary with exchange rate fluctuations ball has been and is presently primarily exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate of the euro british pound canadian dollar polish zloty chinese renminbi brazilian real argentine peso and serbian dinar 

a decrease in the value of any of these currencies especially the euro british pound polish zloty chinese renminbi and canadian dollar relative to the us dollar could reduce our profits from foreign operations and the value of the net assets of our foreign operations when reported in us dollars in our financial statements this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations as reported in us dollars in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to currencies in which the earnings are generated may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations 

we actively manage our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations particularly our exposure to fluctuations in the euro to us dollar exchange rate in order to attempt to mitigate the effect of foreign cash flow and earnings volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes we primarily use forward contracts and options to manage our foreign currency exposures and as a result we experience gains and losses on these derivative positions offset in part by the impact of currency fluctuations on existing assets and liabilities our inability to properly manage our exposure to currency fluctuations could materially impact our results 

our business operating results and financial condition are subject to particular risks in certain regions of the world 

we may experience an operating loss in one or more regions of the world for one or more periods which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition moreover overcapacity which often leads to lower prices exists in a number of the regions in which we operate and may persist even if demand grows our ability to manage such operational fluctuations and to maintain adequate longterm strategies in the face of such developments will be critical to our continued growth and profitability 

if we fail to retain key management and personnel we may be unable to implement our key objectives 

we believe that our future success depends in part on our experienced management team losing the services of key members of our management team could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet our objectives 

  

page 10 of 96 

  

decreases in our ability to apply new technology and knowhow may affect our competitiveness 

our success depends partially on our ability to improve production processes and services we must also introduce new products and services to meet changing customer needs if we are unable to implement better production processes or to develop new products we may not be able to remain competitive with other manufacturers as a result our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

bad weather and climate changes may result in lower sales 

we manufacture packaging products primarily for beverages and foods unseasonably cool weather can reduce demand for certain beverages packaged in our containers in addition poor weather conditions or changes in climate that reduce crop yields of fruits and vegetables can adversely affect demand for our food containers the effects of global warming on climate could have various effects on the demand for our products in different regions around the world 

we are vulnerable to fluctuations in the supply and price of raw materials 

we purchase aluminum steel plastic resin and other raw materials and packaging supplies from several sources while all such materials are available from independent suppliers raw materials are subject to fluctuations in price attributable to a number of factors including general economic conditions commodity price fluctuations particularly aluminum on the london metal exchange the demand by other industries for the same raw materials and the availability of complementary and substitute materials although we enter into commodities purchase agreements from time to time and use derivative instruments to manage our risk we cannot ensure that our current suppliers of raw materials will be able to supply us with sufficient quantities at reasonable prices economic and financial factors could impact our suppliers thereby causing supply shortages increases in raw material costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations because our north american contracts often pass raw material costs directly on to the customer increasing raw material costs may not impact our nearterm profitability but could decrease our sales volumes over time in europe some contracts do not allow us to pass on increased raw material costs and we regularly use derivative agreements to manage this risk our hedging procedures may be insufficient and our results could be materially impacted if costs of materials increase 

prolonged work stoppages at plants with union employees could jeopardize our financial position 

as of december 31 2008 approximately 30 percent of our employees in north america and most of our employees in europe were covered by one or more collective bargaining agreements these collective bargaining agreements have staggered expirations during the next several years although we consider our employee relations to be generally good a prolonged work stoppage or strike at any facility with union employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition we cannot ensure that upon the expiration of existing collective bargaining agreements new agreements will be reached without union action or that any such new agreements will be on terms satisfactory to us potential legislation has been discussed in the united states which may if enacted facilitate the ability of unions to unionize workers and to establish collective bargaining agreements with employers including the company 

our aerospace and technologies segment is subject to certain risks specific to that business including those outlined below 

in our aerospace business existing us government contracts are subject to continued appropriations by congress and may be terminated or delayed if future funding is not made available 

 

our backlog includes both costtype and fixedprice contracts costtype contracts generally have lower profit margins than fixedprice contracts our earnings and margins may vary depending on the types of government contracts undertaken the nature of the work performed under those contracts the costs incurred in performing the work the achievement of other performance objectives and their impact on our ability to receive fees 

 

our business is subject to substantial environmental remediation and compliance costs 

our operations are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental hazards such as emissions to air discharges to water the handling and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes and the cleanup of hazardous substances the us environmental protection agency has designated us along with numerous other  

  

page 11 of 96 

  

companies as a potentially responsible party for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites based on available information we do not believe that any costs incurred in connection with such sites will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations capital expenditures or competitive position the new us executive administration could bring renewed focus and attention to the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental issues

 

there can be no assurance that any acquired business will be successfully integrated into the acquiring company 

while we have what we believe to be well designed integration plans if we cannot successfully integrate newly acquired businesses with those of ball we may experience negative consequences to our business financial condition or results of operations the integration of companies that have previously been operated separately involves a number of risks including difficulties in assimilating and integrating new businesses additional demands on management expenses related to undisclosed or potential liabilities retention of major customers and other risks 

if we have a fair value impairment in a business segment net earnings and net worth could be materially adversely affected by a write down of goodwill 

we have 18255 million of goodwill recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2008 we are required to periodically determine if our goodwill has become impaired in which case we would write down the impaired portion of goodwill if we were required to write down all or a significant part of our goodwill our net earnings and net worth could be materially adversely affected 

if the investments in balls pension plans do not perform as expected we may have to contribute additional amounts to the plans which would otherwise be available to cover operating expenses 

ball maintains defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of its north american and united kingdom employees which we fund based on certain actuarial assumptions the plans ’ assets consist primarily of common stocks fixed income securities and in the us alternative investments due to the significant fall in worldwide equity prices during 2008 the company will increase contributions to the plans during 2009 at this time the company estimates the additional us pension plan contribution to be within the range of 35 million to 40 million pretax however we are monitoring legislative activity and equity markets to determine the final amount we will contribute to ensure that the plans will be able to pay out benefits as scheduled further equity market declines longevity increases or legislative changes could result in a decrease in our available cash flow and net earnings and the recognition of such an increase could result in a reduction to our shareholders equity 

restricted access to capital markets could adversely affect o ur shortterm liquidity and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the notes issued pursuant to our bond indentures 

on december 31 2008 we had total debt of 24101 million and unused committed credit lines in excess of 500 million our ratio of earnings to fixed charges as of that date was 37 times see exhibit 12 attached to this annual report a reduction of financial liquidity could have important consequences including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition approximately 60 percent of our debt bears interest at variable rates if market interest rates increase variablerate debt will create higher debt service requirements which would adversely affect our cash flow while we sometimes enter into agreements limiting our exposure any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk 

  

page 12 of 96 

  

the current global credit financial and economic crisis could have a negative impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

the current global credit financial and economic crisis could have significant negative effects on our operations including but not limited to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

we are subject to us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap under which we are often required to make changes in our accounting and reported results 

us gaap changes are routine and have become more frequent and significant over the past few years these changes can have significant effects on our reported results when compared to prior periods and may even require us to retrospectively adjust prior periods in the application of us gaap management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingencies and reported amounts of revenues and expenses these estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions the proposed steps to adopt international financial reporting standards in the us could exacerbate these risks

 item 3 legal proceedings 

as previously reported the company is investigating potential violations of the foreign corrupt practices act in argentina which came to our attention on or about october 15 2007 the department of justice and the sec were also made aware of this matter on or about the same date based on our investigation to date we do not believe this matter involved senior management or management or other employees who have significant roles in internal control over financial reporting 

as previously reported on october 6 2005 ball metal beverage container corp bmbcc a wholly owned subsidiary of the company was served with an amended complaint filed by crown packaging technology inc et al crown in the us district court for the southern district of ohio western division at dayton ohio the complaint alleges that the manufacture sale and use of certain ends by bmbcc and its customers infringes certain claims of crown’s us patents the complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages fees and declaratory and injunctive relief bmbcc has formally denied the allegations of the complaint a markman order construing the claim terms has been issued in this case and motions for summary judgment have been filed by both parties a trial has been tentatively set to begin in may 2009 based on the information available to the company at the present time the company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity results of operations or financial condition of the company 

as previously reported the us environmental protection agency usepa considers the company a potentially responsible party prp with respect to the lowry landfill site located east of denver colorado on june 12 1992 the company was served with a lawsuit filed by the city and county of denver denver and waste management of colorado inc seeking contributions from the company and approximately 38 other companies the company filed its answer denying the allegations of the complaint on july 8 1992 the company was served with a thirdparty complaint filed by sw shattuck chemical company inc seeking contribution from the company and other companies for the costs associated with cleaning up the lowry landfill the company denied the allegations of the complaints 

in july 1992 the company entered into a settlement and indemnification agreement with chemical waste management inc and waste management of colorado inc collectively waste management and denver pursuant to which waste management and denver dismissed their lawsuit against the company and waste management agreed to defend indemnify and hold harmless the company from claims and lawsuits brought by governmental agencies and other parties relating to actions seeking contributions or remedial costs from the company for the cleanup of the site waste management inc has agreed to guarantee the obligations for waste management waste management and denver may seek additional payments from the company if the response costs related to the site exceed 319 million in 2003 waste management inc indicated that the cost of the site might exceed 319 million in 2030 approximately three years before the projected completion of the project the company might also be responsible for payments based on 1992 dollars for any additional wastes that may have been disposed of by the company at the site but which are identified after the execution of the settlement agreement while remediating the site contaminants were encountered which could add an additional cleanup cost of approximately 10 million this additional cleanup cost could in turn add approximately 1 million to total site costs for the prp group 

at this time there are no lowry landfill actions in which the company is actively involved based on the information available to the company at this time the company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity results of operations or financial condition of the company 

as previously reported the usepa has sent notice of potential liability to ball and other prps with respect to four parcels at the rocky flats industrial park site and other adjacent sites located in jefferson county colorado as well as with respect to the solvents recovery of new england site located in southington connecticut based on the information available to the company at the present time the company believes that these matters will not have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity results of operations or financial condition of the company 

 

on december 30 2002 the company received a letter from the usepa pursuant to the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla requesting answers to certain questions regarding the waste disposal practices of heekin can company which the company acquired in 1993 and the relationship between the company and heekin can company region 5 of the usepa is involved in the cleanup

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

management’s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes ball corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as “ball” or “the company” or “we” or “our” in the following discussion and analysis 

business overview 

ball corporation is one of the world’s leading suppliers of metal and plastic packaging to the beverage food and household products industries our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses and are manufactured in plants around the world we also supply aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers 

we sell our packaging products primarily to major beverage food and household products companies with which we have developed longterm customer relationships this is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of longterm supply contracts while we have a diversified customer base we sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major companies in north america europe the people ’ s republic of china prc and argentina as do our equity joint ventures in brazil the us and the prc we also purchase raw materials from relatively few suppliers because of our customer and supplier concentration our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss of a major customer or supplier or a change in a supply agreement with a major customer or supplier although our contracts and longterm relationships help us to mitigate those risks in the majority of circumstances 

in the rigid packaging industry sales and earnings can be improved by reducing costs increasing prices developing new products and expanding volume over the past two years we have closed several packaging facilities in support of our ongoing objective of matching our supply with market demand we have also identified and implemented plans to improve our return on invested capital through the redeployment of assets within our worldwide beverage can business 

while the north american beverage container manufacturing industry is relatively mature the european prc and brazilian beverage can markets are growing and are expected to continue to grow in the medium to longterm while we are able to capitalize on this growth by increasing capacity in some of our european can manufacturing facilities by speeding up certain lines and by expansion we have put on hold various projects including the completion of the construction of the poland plant and new construction in india due to the current worldwide economic environment we are proceeding with the recently announced new oneline metal beverage can plant in our brazil joint venture and are adding further can capacity in the existing brazilian can plant these brazilian expansion efforts will be owned by ball’s unconsolidated 50percentowned joint venture latapackball embalagens ltda and the expansion is being funded by cash flows from operations and incurrence of debt by the joint venture 

as part of our packaging strategy we are focused on developing and marketing new and existing products that meet the needs of our customers and the ultimate consumer these innovations include new shapes sizes opening features and other functional benefits of both metal and plastic packaging this packaging development activity helps us maintain and expand our supply positions with major beverage food and household products customers as part of this focus we installed a new aluminum bottle line as well as a 24ounce beverage can production line in our monticello indiana facility both of which became operational during the third quarter of 2008 

ball’s consolidated earnings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and we attempt to mitigate this exposure through the use of derivative financial instruments as discussed in “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” within item 7a of this report

the primary customers for the products and services provided by our aerospace and technologies segment are us government agencies or their prime contractors it is possible that federal budget reductions and priorities or changes in agency budgets could limit future funding and new contract awards or delay or prolong contract performance we expect that the delay of certain program awards as well as federal budget considerations under the new administration will have an unfavorable impact on this segment in 2009 and we are taking steps to adjust our resources accordingly 

we recognize sales under longterm contracts in the aerospace and technologies segment using the costtocost percentage of completion method of accounting our present contract mix consists of approximately twothirds percent costtype contracts which are billed at our costs plus an agreed upon andor earned profit component while the remainder are fixedprice contracts we include time and material contracts in the fixedprice category because such contracts typically provide for the sale of engineering labor at fixed hourly rates failure to be awarded certain key contracts could further adversely affect segment performance during 2009 compared to 2008 

throughout the period of contract performance we regularly reevaluate and if necessary revise our estimates of batc’s total contract revenue total contract cost and progress toward completion because of contract payment schedules limitations on funding and other contract terms our sales and accounts receivable for this segment include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed 

management uses various measures to evaluate company performance the primary financial metric we use is economic value added taxeffected operating earnings as defined by the company less a charge for net operating assets employed our goal is to increase economic value added on an annual basis other financial metrics we use are earnings before interest and taxes ebit earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda diluted earnings per share operating cash flow and free cash flow generally defined by the company as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures these financial measures may be adjusted at times for items that affect comparability between periods nonfinancial measures in the packaging segments include production efficiency and spoilage rates quality control figures environmental health and safety statistics and production and sales volumes additional measures used to evaluate performance in the aerospace and technologies segment include contract revenue realization award and incentive fees realized proposal win rates and backlog including awarded contracted and funded backlog 

we recognize that attracting developing and retaining highly talented employees are essential to the success of ball and because of this we strive to pay employees competitively and encourage their ownership of the company’s common stock as part of a diversified portfolio for most management employees a meaningful portion of compensation is at risk as an incentive dependent upon economic valueadded operating performance for more senior positions more compensation is at risk through economic valueadded performance and various stock compensation plans through our employee stock purchase plan and 401k plan which matches employee contributions with ball common stock employees regardless of organizational level have opportunities to own ball stock 

consolidated sales and earnings 

the company has five reportable segments organized along a combination of product lines after aggregating operating segments that have similar economic characteristics 1 metal beverage packaging americas and asia 2 metal beverage packaging europe 3 metal food and household products packaging americas 4 plastic packaging americas and 5 aerospace and technologies we also have investments in companies in the us the prc and brazil which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and accordingly those results are not included in segment sales or earnings 

due to first quarter 2008 management reporting changes ball’s operations in the prc with 2008 net sales of 2896 million are now aggregated and included in the metal beverage packaging americas and asia segment previously included within the company’s european operations also effective january 1 2007 a plastic pail product line with 2007 net sales of 521 million was transferred from the metal food and household products packaging americas segment to the plastic packaging americas segment prior periods have been retrospectively adjusted to the current presentation

metal beverage packaging americas and asia 

the metal beverage packaging americas and asia segment consists of operations located in the us canada puerto rico through fiscal year 2008 and the prc which manufacture metal container products used in beverage packaging as well as nonbeverage plastic containers manufactured and sold mainly in the prc 

this segment accounted for 40 percent of consolidated net sales in 2008 41 percent in 2007 including the impact from the 856 million legal settlement with miller discussed below and 42 percent in 2006 excluding the effect of the legal settlement sales were 4 percent lower in 2008 than in 2007 primarily as a result of 2008 decreases in north american sales volumes of approximately 5 percent the decrease in north american sales volumes was due primarily to lower unit volume sales to carbonated soft drink customers consistent with the industry and lost beer sales volumes on discontinuance of a contract that did not provide sufficient profitability this decrease was somewhat offset by sales volume increases in the prc of 14 percent during 2008 sales were 10 percent higher in 2007 than in 2006 7 percent higher including the effect from the legal settlement with flat volumes being offset by higher sales prices which were primarily due to rising aluminum prices and the pass through of various cost increases to customers based on publicly available information we estimate that our shipments of metal beverage containers were approximately 30 percent of total us and canadian shipments and 22 percent of total prc shipments in 2008 we continue to focus efforts on the growing custom beverage can business which includes cans of different shapes diameters and fill volumes and cans with added functional attributes for new products and product line extensions 

during the second quarter of 2007 miller asserted various claims against a wholly owned subsidiary of the company primarily related to the pricing of the aluminum component of the containers supplied by the subsidiary and on october 4 2007 the dispute was settled in mediation miller received 856 million 518 million after tax on settlement of the dispute and ball retained all of miller’s beverage can and end supply through 2015 miller received a onetime payment of 703 million 425 million after tax in january 2008 recorded on the december 31 2007 consolidated balance sheet in other current liabilities with the remainder of the settlement to be recovered over the life of the supply contract which extends through 2015 on july 1 2008 miller’s business was combined with the us business of coors brewing company which we also supply to form millercoors llc 

segment earnings in 2008 were 2435 million 2841 million excluding business consolidation costs discussed in more detail below compared to 2408 million 3264 million excluding the legal settlement in 2007 and 2858 million in 2006 excluding the 406 million in business consolidation charges in 2008 and 856 million settlement in 2007 earnings in 2008 were lower than in 2007 by 13 percent primarily due to raw material inventory gains of 52 million realized in 2007 which did not recur in 2008 earnings in 2008 were also negatively impacted by lower north american sales volumes which were partially offset by the higher sales volumes in the prc positive cost impacts from a new end technology project commenced in 2006 and other cost optimization measures partially offset the prior year nonrecurring inventory gain and the unfavorable net sales volume decreases the higher segment earnings in 2007 before the legal settlement compared to 2006 were due to raw material inventory gains in 2007 that exceeded 2006 by approximately 30 million also contributing were approximately 9 million of lower manufacturing costs related to the new end technology project and improved production efficiencies these gains were offset by increased repair and maintenance costs and higher labor and other conversion costs a portion of which could not be passed through to our customers 

on april 23 2008 ball announced that by the end of 2008 it would close a metal beverage packaging plant in kent washington and in 2008 recorded pretax charges of 71 million 43 million after tax including the sale of the plant facility in the fourth quarter the closure of the kent facility is expected to result in net fixed costs savings of approximately 10 million in 2009 also in the second quarter of 2008 a gain of 72 million 44 million after tax was recorded for the recovery of previously expensed pension employee severance and other benefit closure obligation costs no longer required this reflects a decision made in the second quarter to continue to operate existing endmaking equipment and not install a new beverage can end module that would have been part of our multiyear project 

on october 30 2008 ball announced the closure of two north american metal beverage can plants a plant in kansas city missouri which primarily manufactures specialty beverage cans will be closed by the end of the first quarter 2009 with manufacturing volumes absorbed by other north american beverage can plants a plant in puerto rico which manufactured 12ounce beverage cans was closed at the end of 2008 a pretax charge of 

  

page 22 of 96 

  

approximately 407 million 252 million after tax was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008 with an additional 5 million 3 million after tax expected in 2009 cost reductions associated with these plant closings are expected to be up to 30 million in 2009 and be 7 million cash positive upon final disposition of the assets 

metal beverage packaging europe 

the metal beverage packaging europe segment includes metal beverage packaging products manufactured in europe ball packaging europe which represents an estimated 29 percent of total european metal beverage container manufacturing capacity has manufacturing plants located in germany the united kingdom france the netherlands poland and serbia and is the second largest metal beverage container business in europe 

this segment accounted for 25 percent of consolidated net sales in 2008 22 percent in 2007 and 20 percent in 2006 segment sales in 2008 as compared to 2007 were 13 percent higher due largely to approximately 8 percent higher sales volume consistent with overall market growth higher sales prices and foreign currency sales gains of 8 percent on the strength of the euro these positive impacts were offset by certain small unfavorable cost changes including product mix changes towards smaller containers segment sales in 2007 were 26 percent higher than in 2006 due primarily to over 9 percent higher sales volume higher sales prices and foreign currency sales gains of 9 percent on the strength of the euro higher segment volumes in both periods were aided by the growth in europe of specialty can volumes including the successful introduction of the ball sleek can into italy the slow return of the metal beverage can to the german market following the mandatory deposit legislation previously reported on is being offset by stronger demand outside germany 

segment earnings were 2309 million in 2008 2289 million in 2007 and 2523 million 1768 million excluding a 755 million property insurance gain in 2006 earnings in 2008 were positively impacted by an increase in net margins of 55 million due to the combined impact of the increased sales volumes and price recovery initiatives which exceeded the negative impact from product mix as well as approximately 20 million related to a stronger euro these improvements were partially offset by 36 million of higher other costs including a negative foreign exchange impact from the conversion of the british pound to the euro and 351 million for business interruption recoveries in 2007 that were not repeated in 2008 for further details see below earnings in 2007 compared to 2006 excluding the 755 million property insurance gain received in 2006 due to a fire at the company’s hassloch germany metal beverage can plant further details are provided below were positively impacted by an increase in net margins of 76 million due to the combined impact of increased sales volumes and price recovery initiatives 16 million from cost control programs and 13 million related to a stronger euro these improvements were partially offset by 26 million of other higher costs and 159 million of lower business interruption insurance recognition in 2007 

on april 1 2006 a fire in the metal beverage can plant in hassloch germany damaged a significant portion of the building and machinery and equipment the property insurance proceeds recorded for the combined years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 which were based on replacement cost were €863 million 1099 million a €267 million 338 million fixed asset write down was recorded to reflect the estimated impairment of the assets damaged as a result of the fire as a result a pretax gain of €596 million 755 million was recorded in the 2006 consolidated statement of earnings to reflect the difference between the net book value of the impaired assets and the property insurance proceeds an additional €272 million 351 million and €40 million 51 million were recorded in cost of sales in 2007 and 2006 respectively for insurance recoveries related to business interruption costs as well as €113 million 143 million in 2006 to offset cleanup costs 

metal food and household products packaging americas 

the metal food and household products packaging americas segment consists of operations located in the us canada and argentina the company acquired us can corporation us can on march 27 2006 and with that acquisition added to its metal food can business the production and sale of aerosol cans paint cans plastic pails and decorative specialty cans effective january 1 2007 responsibility for the plastic pail product line with 2007 net sales of 521 million was transferred to the plastic packaging americas segment accordingly 2006 segment amounts have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the transfer 

  

page 23 of 96 

  

this segment accounted for 16 percent of consolidated net sales in 2008 16 percent in 2007 and 17 percent in 2006 segment sales in 2008 increased 3 percent as compared to 2007 mostly due to higher selling prices offset by an approximate 3 percent decrease in sales volumes primarily as a result of decisions by management to discontinue low margin business which led to the announced closure of our commerce california and tallapoosa georgia facilities in 2007 we estimate our 2008 shipments account for approximately 19 percent and 50 percent of total annual us and canadian steel food container and steel aerosol container shipments respectively segment sales in 2007 increased 4 percent as compared to 2006 due to an approximate 10 percent increase in sales for the inclusion of a full year’s sales from the acquisition of us can partially offset by a 3 percent decline in sales from lost business as well as customer operating issues in food cans including a fire in a customer’s factory and unfavorable weather conditions in the midwest 

segment earnings were 697   million 681 million excluding a 16 million gain from business consolidation activities in 2008 compared to a loss of 8 million earnings of 362 million excluding business consolidation costs of 442 million in 2007 and earnings of 24 million 379 million excluding business consolidation costs of 355 million in 2006 excluding the business consolidation activities for each period earnings in 2008 exceeded 2007 by approximately 88 percent primarily related to improved pricing better manufacturing performance and the settlement of a claim in the amount of almost 7 million offset by the negative impact of 3 percent lower sales volumes in 2008 the 4 percent lower earnings in 2007 compared to 2006 excluding the business consolidation charges were primarily related to increased steel and coating material costs partially offset by improved manufacturing performance in 2007 and higher cost of sales in the second quarter of 2006 related to 61 million of purchase accounting adjustments for inventory valuations associated with the acquired us can finished goods inventory while pricing pressures continue on all of our raw materials other direct materials and freight and utility costs we continue to seek price increases in the market place 

in october 2007 ball announced plans to close aerosol manufacturing plants in tallapoosa georgia and commerce california and announced its intent to exit the custom and decorative tinplate can business located in baltimore maryland a pretax charge of 442 million 268 million after tax was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2007 primarily related to these closures ball incurred additional net pretax charges of 35 million primarily related to lease cancellation costs for the closure of the commerce facility during 2008 additionally during the fourth quarter of 2008 it was determined based on market conditions that we would remain in the custom and decorative tinplate can business which resulted in the reversal of 54 million in business consolidation charges previously recorded we closed the tallapoosa facility early in the first quarter of 2009 and do not anticipate further charges related to this closure when completed in 2009 the actions are expected to yield annualized pretax cost savings in excess of 15 million and improve the aerosol plant utilization rate to more than 85 percent from about 70 percent the cash costs of these actions are expected to be offset by proceeds on asset dispositions and tax recoveries 

in the fourth quarter of 2006 as part of the realignment of the metal food and household products packaging americas segment a charge of 355 million 287 million after tax was recorded primarily related to the closure of a plant in burlington ontario for employee termination and pension costs plant decommissioning costs and fixed asset impairment charges the burlington plant was sold during the third quarter of 2008 completing the restructuring plan except for pension costs which resulted in an additional 03 million in business consolidation charges 

as reported in our second quarter form 10q during the third quarter our aerosol business experienced a tinplate supply issue due to a major supplier’s failure to deliver committed metal while this matter affected a limited seasonal part of this segment’s product mix it caused a supply disruption with some of our customers that resulted in lost sales and profitability for ball during the year we have made every effort to fulfill our customers’ requests and minimize the impact on our customer base we are now receiving the necessary tinplate to produce products for our customers and future raw material supply arrangements are scheduled 

plastic packaging americas 

the plastic packaging americas segment consists of operations located in the us and canada through most of the third quarter of 2008 which manufacture pet and polypropylene plastic container products used mainly in beverage and food packaging as well as high density polyethylene and polypropylene containers for industrial and household product applications on march 28 2006 ball acquired certain north american plastic bottle container 

  

page 24 of 96 

  

assets from alcan packaging alcan including two plastic container manufacturing plants in the us and one in canada as well as certain manufacturing equipment and other assets from other alcan facilities effective january 1 2007 the plastic packaging americas segment assumed responsibility for plastic pail assets acquired as part of the us can acquisition accordingly 2006 segment amounts have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the transfer manufacturing operations ceased in canada during the third quarter of 2008 with the closure of the brampton ontario plant 

this segment accounted for 9 percent of consolidated net sales in 2008 10 percent in both 2007 and 2006 segment sales in 2008 decreased 2 percent or approximately 17 million as compared to 2007 due to a decrease of approximately 9 percent in sales volume offset by higher raw material cost increases passed through to customers during 2008 the volume loss included decreases in carbonated soft drink and water bottle sales due in part to lower convenience store sales by our customers which were partially offset by higher sales in specialty business markets eg custom hotfill alcohol food and juice drinks reduced preform sales also contributed to the 2008 sales decrease due in part to the bankruptcy filing of a preform customer segment sales in 2007 increased 8 percent as compared to 2006 primarily due to an increase in sales of 7 percent related to the march 2006 acquisition of alcan and the inclusion of the acquired us can plastic pail business as well as an increase of 3 percent for higher sales volumes related to the legacy business 

segment earnings were 75   million in 2008 259 million in 2007 and 283 million in 2006 excluding the business consolidation charges of 83 million in 2008 further details are provided below and 04 million in 2007 earnings in 2008 were lower than in 2007 by approximately 40 percent primarily due to the previously mentioned volume losses and a 18 million charge due to a customer bankruptcy filing during the second quarter of 2008 earnings in 2007 were lower than in 2006 primarily due to lower sales margins related to approximately 5 million of customer pricing concessions and 2 million of higher labor and overhead costs the earnings inhibitors were partially offset by approximately 2 million from volume growth in specialty pet sales combined with the incremental margin impact of sales in the first quarter of 2007 related to the acquired alcan and us can plants in view of the low pet margins we continue to focus our efforts on price and margin recovery initiatives as well as pet development efforts in the custom hotfill beer wine flavored alcoholic beverage and specialty container markets in the polypropylene plastic container arena development efforts are primarily focused on custom packaging markets 

we estimate our 2008 shipments of pet plastic bottles to be approximately 10 percent of total us and canadian pet container shipments in addition the plastic packaging americas segment shipped approximately 750 million polypropylene food and specialty containers during 2008 

on june 26 2008 ball announced the closure of a plastic packaging manufacturing plant in brampton ontario which ceased operations in the third quarter of 2008 a pretax charge of 83 million 78 million after tax was recorded during 2008 for employee termination and other benefit costs lease cancellation costs and fixed asset impairment the brampton operations have been consolidated into the company’s other plastic packaging manufacturing facilities in the united states and the closure of this facility is expected to result in annual fixedcost savings of approximately 4 million beginning in 2009 

aerospace and technologies 

aerospace and technologies segment sales represented 10 percent of consolidated net sales in 2008 11 percent in 2007 and 10 percent in 2006 segment sales in 2008 were 5 percent lower as compared to 2007 as a result of a combination of large programs nearing completion program terminations delays in program awards and government funding constraints the reductions were partially offset by new program starts and increased scope on previously awarded contracts segment sales in 2007 were 17 percent higher than in 2006 due to new programs cost overruns on fixedprice contracts increased scope on previously awarded contracts and growth in our commercial contracts 

some of the segment’s highprofile contracts include the worldview 2 advanced commercial remote sensing satellites the james webb space telescope a successor to the hubble space telescope the spacebased space surveillance system which will detect and track space objects such as satellites and orbital debris npoess the nextgeneration satellite weather monitoring system and a number of antennas for the joint strike fighter

segment earnings in 2008 were 833 million 762 million excluding the sale of an australian subsidiary discussed in more detail below 646 million in 2007 and 50 million in 2006 excluding the pretax gain on the sale of bsg of 71 million in the first quarter of 2008 earnings in 2008 were up 18 percent in comparison to 2007 earnings improved year over year as the sales volume decline described above was more than offset by improved margins on contracts due to improvements in program execution risk retirement on several fixed price programs as well as a reduction of unreimbursable pension and benefit expenses earnings improvement in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to higher net sales particularly related to the worldview and other commercial space contracts an improved contract mix and better program execution 

on february 15 2008 ball completed the sale of its shares in bsg to qinetiq pty ltd for approximately 105 million including cash sold of 18 million bsg provided services to the australian department of defense and related government agencies after an adjustment for working capital items the sale resulted in a pretax gain of 71 million 

sales to the us government either directly as a prime contractor or indirectly as a subcontractor represented 91 percent of segment sales in 2008 84 percent in 2007 and 90 percent in 2006 contracted backlog for the aerospace and technologies segment at december 31 2008 and 2007 was 597 million and 774 million respectively 

additional segment information 

for additional information regarding the company’s segments see the summary of business segment information in note 2 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report the charges recorded for business consolidation activities were based on estimates by ball management and were developed from information available at the time if actual outcomes vary from the estimates the differences will be reflected in current period earnings in the consolidated statement of earnings and identified as business consolidation gains and losses additional details about our business consolidation activities and associated costs are provided in note 6 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report 

undistributed corporate expenses net 

undistributed corporate expenses net were 396 million 383 million and 375 million for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively included in the undistributed corporate expenses for 2008 was 115 million for marktomarket losses related to aluminum derivative instruments that will reverse and result in a gain in 2009 these aluminum derivative instruments are fully matched with customer sales arrangements that mature in 2009 therefore the marktomarket losses will reverse in 2009 resulting in 115 million of pretax earnings 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative sga expenses were 2882 million 3237 million and 2872 million for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the decreases in sga expenses in 2008 compared to 2007 were due to 76 million of lower general and administrative costs as a result of the sale in february 2008 of the aerospace and technologies segment’s australian subsidiary lower aerospace research and development costs and bid and proposal costs of 37 million life insurance death benefits of 65 million settlement of a claim for approximately 7 million the favorable net yearoveryear change in foreign currency hedges and exchange impacts of 116 million and other miscellaneous net cost reductions 

the increase in sga expenses in 2007 compared to 2006 were 45 million of additional sga from the us can acquisition higher research and development costs and aerospace bid and proposal costs of 94 million increased sales and marketing efforts of 54 million and 158 million of compensation and benefit increases including yearoveryear incentive compensation costs 

for the us pension plans we intend to maintain our current return on asset assumption of 825 percent and our discount rate assumption of 625 percent for 2009 based on these assumptions and excluding 2008 curtailment expense us pension expense for 2009 is anticipated to increase 39 million compared to 2008 most of which will be included in cost of sales pension expense in europe and canada combined is expected to be comparable to the 2008 expense a reduction of the expected return on pension assets assumption by one quarter of a percentage 

  

page 26 of 96 

  

point would result in an approximate 24 million increase in the 2009 pension expense while a quarter of a percentage point reduction in the discount rate applied to the pension liability would result in an estimated 28 million of additional pension expense in 2009 additional information regarding the company’s pension plans is provided in note 17 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report 

interest and taxes 

consolidated interest expense was 1377 million in 2008 1494 million in 2007 and 1344 million in 2006 the reduced expense in 2008 was primarily due to lower interest rates on floating rate debt as us and european central banks cut interest rates amid the global financial crisis the higher expense in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to the additional borrowings used to finance the acquisitions of us can and the alcan assets combined with higher interest rates in 2007 

ball’s consolidated effective income tax rate for 2008 was 326 percent compared to 263 percent in 2007 and 294 percent in 2006 the lower tax rate in 2007 as compared to 2008 and 2006 was primarily the result of earnings mix higher foreign earnings taxed at lower rates and net tax benefit adjustments of 172 million recorded in 2007 additionally the inability to fully use canadian net operating losses on plant closures in 2008 and 2006 contributed to higher rates in those years the 2008 rate was partially reduced by a 45 million tax benefit recognized during the third quarter of 2008 for an enacted tax law change in the united kingdom which was offset by the impact of nondeductible losses in the cash surrender value of certain companyowned life insurance plans the 172 million net reduction in the 2007 tax provision was primarily a result of enacted income tax rate reductions in germany and the united kingdom and a tax loss related to the company’s canadian operations which were offset by an increase in the tax provision in 2007 to adjust for the final settlement negotiations concluded with the internal revenue service irs related to a companyowned life insurance plan discussed below based on current estimates the 2009 effective income tax rate is expected to be around 335 percent 

during 2007 the company concluded final settlement negotiations with the irs on the deductibility of interest expense on incurred loans from a companyowned life insurance plan an additional accrual of 7 million was made in the third quarter of 2007 to adjust the accrued liability to the final settlement of 184 million including interest for the years 20002004 which were under examination and for the unaudited years 20052006 this settlement included agreement on the prospective treatment of interest deductibility on the policy loans which will not have a significant impact on earnings per share cash flow or liquidity in future periods further details are available in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report 

results of equity affiliates 

equity in the earnings of affiliates is primarily attributable to our 50 percent ownership in packaging investments in the us and brazil earnings were 145 million in 2008 129 million in 2007 and 147 million in 2006

our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities and external committed borrowings we believe that cash flows from operations and cash provided by shortterm and committed revolver borrowings when necessary will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements scheduled principal and interest payments on debt dividend payments and anticipated capital expenditures we had in excess of half a billion dollars of available funds under committed multicurrency revolving credit facilities at december 31 2008 however our liquidity could be impacted significantly by a decrease in demand for our products which could arise from competitive circumstances the current global credit financial and economic crisis or any of the other factors we describe in item 1a “risk factors”

in our worldwide beverage can business we use financial derivative contracts as discussed in “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” within item 7a of this report to manage future aluminum price volatility for our customers as these derivative contracts are matched to customer sales contracts they have little or no economic impact on our earnings ball’s financial counterparties to these derivative contracts require ball to post collateral in certain circumstances when the negative marktomarket value of the contracts exceeds specified levels additionally ball has similar collateral posting arrangements with certain customers and other financial counterparties on these derivative contracts at december 31 2008 ball had 2295 million of cash posted as collateral and had received 124 million of cash from customers for a net amount of 1055 million the cash flows of the collateral postings are shown in the investing section of our consolidated statements of cash flows assuming aluminum prices remain unchanged we would expect to recover all of these cash deposits in 2009 

cash flows provided by operations were 6276 million in 2008 compared to 673 million in 2007 and 4014 million in 2006 the reduction in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily due to the payment of approximately 70 million in january 2008 of a legal settlement to a customer this reduction was partially offset by the net impact of increases in net earnings and depreciation lower tax payments lower pension contributions and a net increase in working capital during the year the improvement in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to higher net earnings before the legal settlement in 2007 and the insurance gain in 2006 related to the hassloch fire the improvement in 2007 was also the result of reduced changes in working capital components and lower income tax payments partially offset by higher pension contributions 

management internally uses a free cash flow measure 1 to evaluate the company’s operating results 2 to plan stockbuy back levels 3 to evaluate strategic investments and 4 to evaluate the company’s ability to incur and service debt free cash flow is not a defined term under us generally accepted accounting principles and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures the company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less additions to property plant and equipment capital spending free cash flow is typically derived directly from the company’s cash flow statements however it may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods an example of such an item included the company’s decision in 2007 to contribute an additional 445 million 273 million after tax to its pension plans additional examples include property insurance proceeds for the replacement of the firedamaged assets in our hassloch germany plant which are included in capital spending amounts in 2006 

based on this our consolidated free cash flow is summarized as follows 

 

based on information currently available we estimate cash flows from operating activities for 2009 to be approximately 625 million capital spending to be approximately 250 million and free cash flow to be in the 375 million range capital spending of 3069 million in 2008 exceeded depreciation and amortization expense of 2974 million we have reduced our expected capital spending year over year and we do not intend to buy back stock until the capital markets show sufficient signs of recovery initially in 2009 we will focus on reducing our debt and growing our cash balances 

debt facilities and refinancing 

interestbearing debt at december 31 2008 increased 515 million to 241 billion from 236 billion at december 31 2007 the 2008 debt increase from 2007 was primarily due to the financing of 1055 million in net cash collateral deposits in 2009 we intend to allocate our operating cash flow to reducing our debt and growing our cash balances while covering our capital spending programs dividends and incremental pension funding 

 

at december 31 2008 502 million was available under the company’s multicurrency revolving credit facilities the company also had 332 million of shortterm uncommitted credit facilities available at the end of the year of which 1556 million was outstanding the committed credit facilities are available until october 2011 

 

  

page 28 of 96 

  

 

given our free cash flow projections and unused credit facilities that are available until october 2011 the company’s liquidity is strong and is expected to meet its ongoing operating cash flow and debt service requirements while the current financial and economic conditions have raised concerns about credit risk with counterparties to derivative transactions the company mitigates its exposure by spreading the risk among various counterparties thus limiting exposure with any one party the company also monitors the credit ratings of its suppliers customers lenders and counterparties on a regular basis 

 

the current financial and economic environment has exacerbated liquidity and credit risks with some of our customers and suppliers in october 2008 we advanced interestbearing funding of 22 million in support of one of our key suppliers which advance is secured by accounts receivable and inventory 

the company has a receivables sales agreement that provides for the ongoing revolving sale of a designated pool of trade accounts receivable of ball’s north american packaging operations up to 250 million the agreement qualifies as offbalance sheet financing under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 140 as amended by sfas no 156 net funds received from the sale of the accounts receivable totaled 250 million and 170 million at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively and are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets 

the company was in compliance with all loan agreements at december 31 2008 and all prior years presented and has met all debt payment obligations the us note agreements bank credit agreement and industrial development revenue bond agreements contain certain restrictions relating to dividends investments financial ratios guarantees and the incurrence of additional indebtedness additional details about the company’s debt and receivables sales agreements are available in notes 15 and 9 respectively accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report 

other liquidity items 

cash payments required for longterm debt maturities rental payments under noncancellable operating leases purchase obligations and other commitments in effect at december 31 2008 are summarized in the following table

contributions to the company’s defined benefit pension plans not including the unfunded german plans may be in the range of 88 million to 93 million in 2009 this estimate may change based on changes in the pension protection act and actual plan asset performance among other factors benefit payments related to these plans are expected to be 695 million 737 million 764 million 81 million and 845 million for the years ending december 31 2009 through 2013 respectively and a total of 4827 million for the years 2014 through 2018 payments to participants in the unfunded german plans are expected to be approximately 24 million to 25 million in each of the years 2009 through 2013 and a total of 1256 million for the years 2014 through 2018

 

our share repurchases in 2008 aggregated 2996 million net of issuances compared to 2113 million net of repurchases in 2007 and 457 million in 2006 the net repurchases in 2008 included a 31 million settlement on january 7 2008 of a forward contract entered into in december 2007 for the repurchase of 675000 shares additionally in 2007 net repurchases included a 519 million settlement on january 5 2007 of a forward contract entered into in december 2006 for the repurchase of 1200000 shares we do not expect to repurchase a significant number of common shares in 2009 

on december 12 2007 in a privately negotiated transaction ball entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement to buy 100 million of its common shares using cash on hand and available borrowings the company advanced the 100 million on january 7 2008 and received 2038657 shares which represented 90 percent of the total shares as calculated using the previous day’s closing price the agreement was settled on july 11 2008 and the company received an additional 138521 shares 

annual cash dividends paid on common stock were 40 cents per share in 2008 2007 and 2006 total dividends paid were 375 million in 2008 406 million in 2007 and 41 million in 2006 

contingencies 

the company is subject to various risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of business due in part to the competitive nature of the industries in which the company participates we do business in countries outside the us have changing commodity prices for the materials used in the manufacture of our packaging products and participate in changing capital markets we attempt to reduce these risks and uncertainties through the establishment of risk management policies and procedures including at times the use of certain derivative financial instruments as explained in item 7a of this report 

from time to time the company is subject to routine litigation incident to its businesses additionally the us environmental protection agency has designated ball as a potentially responsible party along with numerous other companies for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites 

pursuant to the merger agreement with the former shareholders of us can a certain portion of the common share consideration issued for the acquisition of us can was placed in escrow and was subsequently converted into cash which was to be used for the settlement of certain postacquisition claims pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement during the second quarter of 2007 ball asserted claims against the former shareholders of us can which were disputed the representative for the former shareholders of us can filed a lawsuit against the company in the first quarter of 2008 seeking a declaration of the parties’ rights and obligations with respect to the claims asserted by the company this matter was settled during the fourth quarter of 2008 

our information at this time does not indicate that these matters will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity results of operations or financial condition of the company 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period future events could affect these estimates see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report for a summary of the company’s critical and significant accounting policies 

management believes that evaluation of ball’s performance during the periods covered by these consolidated financial statements should be based upon historical financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial instruments and risk management 

in the ordinary course of business we employ established risk management policies and procedures which seek to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices interest rates foreign currencies and prices of the company’s common stock in regard to common share repurchases although there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be successful although the instruments utilized involve varying degrees of credit market and interest risk the counterparties to the agreements are expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements the company monitors counterparty credit risk including lenders on a regular basis but we cannot be certain that all risks will be discerned or that its risk management policies and procedures will always be effective 

we have estimated our market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis market risk exposure has been defined as the changes in fair value of derivative instruments financial instruments and commodity positions to test the sensitivity of our market risk exposure we have estimated the changes in fair value of market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in market prices or rates the results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized below 

commodity price risk 

we manage our north american commodity price risk in connection with market price fluctuations of aluminum ingot primarily by entering into container sales contracts that include aluminum ingotbased pricing terms that generally reflect price fluctuations under our commercial supply contracts for aluminum sheet purchases the terms include fixed floating or passthrough aluminum ingot component pricing this matched pricing affects most of our north american metal beverage packaging net sales we also at times use certain derivative instruments such as option and forward contracts as cash flow and fair value hedges of commodity price risk where there is not a passthrough arrangement in the sales contract to match underlying purchase volumes and pricing with sales volumes and pricing 

most of the plastic packaging americas sales contracts include provisions to fully pass through resin cost changes as a result we believe we have minimal exposure related to changes in the cost of plastic resin most metal food and household products packaging americas sales contracts either include provisions permitting us to pass through some or all steel cost changes we incur or they incorporate annually negotiated steel costs in 2008 and in 2007 we were able to pass through to our customers the majority of steel cost increases we anticipate at this time that we will be able to pass through the majority of the steel price increases that occur over the next 12 months 

in europe and the prc the company manages the aluminum and steel raw material commodity price risks through annual and longterm contracts for the purchase of the materials as well as certain sales of containers that reduce the companys exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices within the current year these purchase and sales contracts include fixed price floating and passthrough pricing arrangements we also use forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges to manage future aluminum price risk and foreign exchange exposures to match underlying purchase volumes and pricing with sales volumes and pricing for those sales contracts where there is not a passthrough arrangement to minimize the company’s exposure to significant price changes 

considering the effects of derivative instruments the company’s ability to pass through certain raw material costs through contractual provisions the market’s ability to accept price increases and the company’s commodity price exposures under its contract terms a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the company’s steel aluminum and resin prices could result in an estimated 6 million aftertax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period additionally if foreign currency exchange rates were to change adversely by 10 percent we estimate there could be an 8 million aftertax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period for foreign currency exposures on raw materials actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates 

the company is also exposed to fluctuations in prices for natural gas and electricity as well as the cost of diesel fuel as a component of freight cost a hypothetical 10 percent increase in our natural gas and electricity prices without considering such passthrough provisions could result in an estimated 7 million aftertax reduction of net earnings 

  

page 32 of 96 

  

over a oneyear period a hypothetical 10 percent increase in diesel fuel prices could result in an estimated 2 million aftertax reduction of net earnings over the same period actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates subsequent to year end the company has taken further steps to reduce its exposure to natural gas and diesel fuel prices in 2009 

interest rate risk 

our objective in managing our exposure to interest rate changes is to minimize the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we use a variety of interest rate swaps collars and options to manage our mix of floating and fixedrate debt interest rate instruments held by the company at december 31 2008 included payfixed interest rate swaps and interest rate collars payfixed swaps effectively convert variable rate obligations to fixed rate instruments collars create an upper and lower threshold within which interest rates will fluctuate 

based on our interest rate exposure at december 31 2008 assumed floating rate debt levels throughout the next 12 months and the effects of derivative instruments a 100basis point increase in interest rates could result in an estimated 7 million aftertax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates and the timing of these changes 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to protect foreign cash flows and earnings from changes associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes through the use of various derivative contracts in addition we manage foreign earnings translation volatility through the use of various foreign currency option strategies and the change in the fair value of those options is recorded in the company’s earnings our foreign currency translation risk results from the european euro british pound canadian dollar polish zloty chinese renminbi hong kong dollar brazilian real argentine peso and serbian dinar we face currency exposures in our global operations as a result of purchasing raw materials in us dollars and to a lesser extent in other currencies sales contracts are negotiated with customers to reflect cost changes and where there is not a foreign exchange passthrough arrangement the company uses forward and option contracts to manage foreign currency exposures we additionally use various option strategies to manage the earnings translation of the company’s european operations into us dollars 

considering the company’s derivative financial instruments outstanding at december 31 2008 and the currency exposures a hypothetical 10 percent reduction us dollar strengthening in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the us dollar could result in an estimated 18 million aftertax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period this amount includes the 8 million currency exposure discussed above in the “commodity price risk” section this hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would also reduce our forecasted average debt balance by 84 million actual changes in market prices or rates may differ from hypothetical changes 

common share repurchases 

as part of the company’s ongoing share repurchase program and as a way to partially reduce the earnings volatility of the company’s variable deferred compensation stock program from time to time the company sells equity put options on its common stock the company currently has 500000 shares of equity put options outstanding at a strike price of 40 per share that expire in less than 12 months 

on december 3 2007 ball entered into a forward repurchase agreement for the purchase of 675000 shares of its common stock this agreement was settled for 31 million on january 7 2008 and the shares were delivered that day on december 12 2007 we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement for approximately 100 million the agreement provided for the delivery of 2038657 shares which represented 90 percent of the total estimated shares to ultimately be delivered the 100 million was paid on january 7 2008 at the time the shares were delivered the agreement was settled on july 11 2008 and the company received an additional 138521 shares

ball corporation ball we the company or our is one of the largest packaging companies in the world our predecessor company ball brothers glass manufacturing company was founded in 1880 by five ball brothers today in addition to metal and plastic packaging products we provide aerospace products and services through a wholly owned subsidiary ball aerospace  technologies corp ball aerospace in 2007 our total consolidated net sales were 74 billion packaging is responsible for 89 percent of that number ball aerospace contributes the rest 

 

we are headquartered in broomfield colorado and employ approximately 15500 people worldwide our stock is traded on the new york stock exchange and the chicago stock exchange under the ticker symbol bll 

 

today ball’s packaging businesses make metal and plastic packaging for beverages foods and household products our largest product lines are aluminum and steel beverage cans which contributed 63 percent of our 2007 total net sales and 85 percent of our 2007 total segment earnings before interest and taxes we also produce steel food cans steel aerosol cans polyethylene terepthalate pet and polypropylene plastic bottles for beverages and foods plastic pails steel paint cans and decorative steel tins our ongoing packaging business dates back to 1969 when ball began supplying beverage cans 

ball aerospace is a leader in the design development and manufacture of innovative aerospace systems it produces spacecraft instruments and sensors radio frequency and microwave technologies data exploitation solutions and a variety of advanced aerospace technologies and products that enable deep space missions our packaging and aerospace businesses share a long history and a common financial philosophy and we benefit from the presence of each 

our corporate strategy is to grow our worldwide beverage can business and our us aerospace business to improve the performance of the metal food and household products packaging americas and plastic packaging americas segments and to utilize free cash flow and earnings growth to increase shareholder value 

our financial philosophy 

ball corporation maintains a clear and disciplined financial strategy focused on improving shareholder returns through 

 

 

 

the compensation of a majority of our employees is tied directly to the company’s performance through our eva® incentive program when the company performs well our employees are paid more if the company doesn’t perform well our employees get paid less or no incentive compensation 

we use free cash flow as a lever as we manage our capital structure the cash generated by our businesses is used primarily 1 to evaluate the companys operating results 2 to plan stock buyback levels 3 to evaluate strategic investments and 4 to evaluate the companys ability to incur and service debt we also will when we believe it will benefit the company and our shareholders make strategic acquisitions or divest parts of our business

our core purpose and values 

we believe that our core purpose and core values are integral to our company’s performance they play an important role in our relationships with employees customers suppliers investors and other key stakeholders we realize that other companies have similar principles under a variety of names the proof is in the way a company and its employees conduct business every day ball corporation has existed for 128 years we believe our core purpose and core values have had much to do with our longevity and success 

ball corporation is in business to add value to all of its stakeholders whether it is providing quality products and services to customers an attractive return on investment to shareholders a meaningful work life for employees or a contribution of time effort and resources to our communities in all of our interactions we ask how we can get better for our own good and the good of those who have a stake in our success our core values include integrity respect motivation flexibility innovation and teamwork 

information pertaining to our packaging business 

a substantial part of ball’s packaging sales are made directly to companies in packaged beverage and food businesses including sabmiller and bottlers of pepsicola and cocacola branded beverages and their affiliates that utilize consolidated purchasing groups sales to sabmiller plc and pepsico inc represented 11 percent and 9 percent of ball’s consolidated net sales respectively for the year ended december 31 2007 additional details about sales to major customers are included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements which can be found in item 8 of this annual report financial statements and supplementary data 

our principal packaging businesses are the manufacture and sale of aluminum steel polyethylene terephthalate pet and polypropylene containers primarily for beverages foods and household products our packaging products are sold in highly competitive markets primarily based on quality service and price the packaging business is capital intensive requiring significant investment in machinery and equipment 

profitability is sensitive to selling prices production volumes labor transportation utility and warehousing costs as well as the availability and price of raw materials such as aluminum steel plastic resin and other direct materials these raw materials are generally available from several sources and we have secured what we consider to be adequate supplies and are not experiencing any shortages there is a high concentration of suppliers in both north america and in europe in north america two steel suppliers provide more than 70 percent of our tinplate steel and four aluminum suppliers provide virtually all of our requirements in europe three steel suppliers and three aluminum suppliers provide approximately 95 percent of our requirements 

we believe we have limited our exposure related to changes in the costs of aluminum steel and plastic resin as a result of 1 the inclusion of provisions in most aluminum container sales contracts to pass through aluminum cost changes as well as the use of derivative instruments 2 the inclusion of provisions in certain steel container sales contracts to pass through steel cost changes and the existence of certain other steel container sales contracts that incorporate annually negotiated metal costs and 3 the inclusion of provisions in substantially all plastic container sales contracts to pass through resin cost changes in 2007 we were able to pass through the majority of steel cost increases levied by producers and we continually attempt to reduce manufacturing and other material costs as much as possible while raw materials and energy sources such as natural gas and electricity may from time to time be in short supply or unavailable due to external factors and the pass through of steel and aluminum costs to our customers may be limited in some instances we cannot predict the timing or effects if any of such occurrences on future operations 

research and development rd efforts in the north american packaging segments as well as in the european metal beverage container business are primarily directed toward packaging innovation specifically the development of new sizes and types of containers as well as new uses for the current containers other rd efforts in these segments seek to improve manufacturing efficiencies our north american packaging rd activities are primarily conducted in the ball technology  innovation center btic located in westminster colorado the european rd activities are primarily conducted in a technical center located in bonn germany

beverage container production capacity in the us canada and mexico exceeds demand in order to more closely balance capacity and demand within our business from time to time we consolidate our can and end manufacturing capacity into fewer more efficient facilities and we are actively considering additional plant rationalizations we also attempt to efficiently match capacity with the changes in customer demand for our packaging products to that end during 2005 ball commenced a project to upgrade and streamline its north american beverage can end manufacturing capabilities a project expected to result in productivity improvements and reduced manufacturing costs we have installed the majority of production modules in this multiyear project the final modules are in the design and installation phase and the project is expected to be mostly completed in 2009 in connection with this project the can end manufacturing operations at the reidsville north carolina plant were shut down during the fourth quarter of 2006 

the aluminum beverage can competes aggressively with other packaging materials the glass bottle has shown resilience in the packaged beer industry while the pet container continues its growth in the carbonated soft drink and water industry in canada metal beverage containers have captured significantly lower percentages of packaged beverage industry volumes than in the us particularly in the packaged beer industry 

the 2006 recycling rate in the united states for aluminum cans was 52 percent the highest recycling rate for any beverage container the aluminum can sheet we currently buy contains an average of 41 percent post consumer recycled content and approximately 9 percent post industrial content reducing the amount of virgin material to 50 percent 

ball’s operations 

metal beverage packaging americas represents ball’s largest segment accounting for 37 percent of consolidated net sales in 2007 metal beverage containers are primarily sold under multiyear supply contracts to fillers of carbonated soft drinks beer energy drinks and other beverages decorated twopiece aluminum beverage cans are produced at 16 manufacturing facilities in the us and one each in canada and puerto rico can ends are produced within three of the us facilities as well as in a fourth facility that manufactures only ends 

through rocky mountain metal container llc a 5050 joint venture which is accounted for as an equity investment ball and coors brewing company coors a wholly owned subsidiary of molson coors brewing company operate beverage can and end manufacturing facilities in golden colorado coors and our largest north american brewery customer miller brewing company have announced plans to combine their us businesses in 2008 subject to regulatory approvals we also participate in a 5050 joint venture in brazil latapackball embalagens ltda that manufactures aluminum cans and ends and is accounted for as an equity investment

metal beverage packaging europeasia segment 

industry background 

the european beverage can market is approximately 50 billion cans about half the size of the north american beverage can market the european market is growing significantly however and is highly regional in terms of growth and packaging mix growth in central and eastern europe has been particularly strong in recent years in poland alone the beverage can market grew by approximately 30 percent from 2006 to 2007 in germany the return of the beverage can market is continuing after it was essentially eliminated in 2003 due to issues surrounding the implementation of mandatory deposit legislation total production grew to about 32 billion cans in 2007 still far below its peak of 73 billion cans in 2001 however the german consumption is only approximately 500 million cans while the majority of german production is still being exported 

sales volumes of metal beverage containers in europe tend to be highest during the period from may through august with a smaller increase in demand during the christmas season as in north america the metal beverage container competes aggressively with other packaging materials used by the european beer and carbonated soft drink industries the glass bottle is heavily utilized in the packaged beer industry while the pet container is increasingly utilized in the carbonated soft drink juice and mineral water industries recycling rates vary throughout europe but average around 53 percent for aluminum and steel containers which exceeds the european union’s goal of 50 percent recycling for metals due in part to the intrinsic value of aluminum and steel metal packaging recycling rates in europe compare favorably to those of other packaging materials ball’s european operations helped establish and financially support recycling initiatives in growing markets such as poland serbia and the people’s republic of china prc to educate consumers about the benefits of recycling aluminum and steel cans and to increase recycling rates 

the beverage can market in the prc is approximately 11 billion cans of which ball’s consolidated operations represent an estimated 22 percent with an additional 13 percent manufactured by two joint ventures in which we participate six other manufacturers make up the remainder of the market capacity grew rapidly in the prc in the late 1990s resulting in a supplydemand imbalance a number of can makers including ball responded by rationalizing capacity demand growth has resumed and projected annual growth is expected to be in the 6 percent range in the near term 

ball’s operations 

ball packaging europe is the largest metal beverage container manufacturer in germany france and the benelux countries and the second largest metal beverage container manufacturer in the united kingdom and poland ball asia pacific limited is one of the largest manufacturers of beverage cans in china 

the metal beverage packaging europeasia segment which accounted for 26 percent of ball’s consolidated net sales in 2007 consists of 10 beverage can plants and two beverage can end plants in europe as well as operations in the prc of the 12 european plants four are located in germany three in the united kingdom two in france and one each in the netherlands poland and serbia the european plants produced slightly more than 14 billion cans in 2007 with approximately 60 percent of those being produced from aluminum and 40 percent from steel six of the can plants use aluminum and four use steel we have also announced plans to construct a second beverage can plant in poland with production scheduled to commence in 2009 overall ball packaging europe is the second largest metal beverage container producer in europe with an estimated 29 percent of european shipments and produces twopiece beverage cans and can ends for producers of beer carbonated soft drinks mineral water fruit juices energy drinks and other beverages 

on april 1 2006 a fire in our hassloch germany plant damaged the majority of the plant’s building and machinery and equipment property insurance proceeds largely covered equipment replacement and cleanup costs and business interruption insurance proceeds generally covered lost volumes and other costs in june 2007 we successfully started up a rebuilt hassloch plant which operates two steel beverage can manufacturing lines also in the first half of 2007 we started up a new aluminum beverage can manufacturing line in our hermsdorf germany plant 

  

page 4 of 94 

  

in 2005 ball completed the construction of an aluminum beverage can manufacturing plant in belgrade serbia to serve the growing demand for beverage cans in southern and eastern europe ball announced plans in january 2008 to build a new beverage can manufacturing plant in poland in order to meet the rapidly growing demand for beverage cans there and elsewhere in central and eastern europe the plant will be built in lublin which is in eastern poland near the borders of belarus and ukraine it will initially have one production line with an annual capacity of approximately 750 million cans per year and is expected to begin production in the first half of 2009 in addition during the fourth quarter of 2007 ball announced plans for a beverage can plant in india that primarily will use existing manufacturing equipment from other ball facilities 

european raw material supply contracts are generally for a period of one year although ball packaging europe has negotiated some longer term agreements aluminum is purchased primarily in us dollars while the functional currencies of ball packaging europe and its subsidiaries are nonus dollars the company minimizes the resulting foreign exchange rate risk through the use of derivative contracts in addition purchase and sales contracts include fixed price floating and passthrough pricing arrangements 

capacity in the prc has continued to grow in recent years resulting in a continuing supplydemand imbalance demand growth in the prc continues to be strong and is projected to grow by approximately 6 percent annually in the near term ball is undertaking selected capacity increases in its existing facilities in order to participate in the projected growth and may establish or obtain additional manufacturing capacity in the coming years if growth in demand continues our operations include the manufacture of aluminum cans and ends in three plants in the prc located in the north central and south regions in addition we participate in two joint ventures that manufacture aluminum cans and ends in the prc 

we also manufacture and sell highdensity plastic containers in two prc plants primarily servicing the motor oil industry 

metal food  household products packaging americas segment 

industry background 

the metal food and household products packaging americas segment competes primarily in the steel tinplate food and aerosol can markets in north america the steel tinplate food can market consists of approximately 31 billion cans annually of which about 40 percent are threepiece cans and 60 percent are twopiece cans the steel tinplate aerosol can market is approximately 32 billion cans annually growth in both markets is expected to be essentially flat over time service quality and price are important competitive factors 

sales volumes of metal food containers in north america tend to be highest from june through october as a result of seasonal fruit vegetable and salmon packs we estimate our 2007 shipments of more than 56 billion steel food containers to be approximately 18 percent of total us and canadian metal food container shipments we estimate our aerosol business accounts for approximately 51 percent of total annual us and canadian steel aerosol shipments 

competitors in the metal food container product line include two national and a small number of regional suppliers and self manufacturers several producers in mexico also manufacture steel food containers competition in the us steel aerosol can market primarily includes two national suppliers steel containers also compete with other packaging materials in the food and household products industry including glass aluminum plastic paper and the standup pouch as a result demand for this product line is dependent on product innovation and cost reduction service quality and price are among the other key competitive factors 

ball’s operations 

the metal food and household products packaging americas segment accounted for 16 percent of consolidated net sales in 2007 the two major product lines in this segment are steel food and subsequent to the acquisition of us can in march 2006 aerosol containers 

  

page 5 of 94 

  

ball produces twopiece and threepiece steel food containers and ends for packaging vegetables fruit soups meat seafood nutritional products pet food and other products these containers and ends are manufactured in nine plants in the us and canada and sold primarily to food processors in north america 

the segment also manufactures and sells aerosol cans paint cans and custom and specialty containers in eight plants in the us and is the largest manufacturer of aerosol cans in north america in addition the company manufactures and sells aerosol cans in two plants in argentina 

in october 2007 as part of a restructuring of ball’s metal food and household products packaging division americas ball announced plans to close aerosol container manufacturing plants in tallapoosa georgia and commerce california ball also announced its intention to exit the custom and decorative tinplate can business based in its baltimore maryland manufacturing plant the company recorded a largely noncash aftertax charge of approximately 27 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 primarily related to the plant closures and equipment relocation when completed throughout 2008 the actions are expected to yield annual pretax cost savings in excess of 15 million and improve the aerosol business’ plant utilization rate to more than 85 percent from about 70 percent 

in december 2006 the company closed a leased facility in alliance ohio which was one of the manufacturing locations acquired from us can and a metal food can manufacturing plant in burlington ontario which was part of the metal food can operations prior to the us can acquisition the closure of the alliance plant was treated as an opening balance sheet item related to the acquisition a pretax charge of 336 million 274 million after tax was recorded in the fourth quarter in respect of the burlington plant closure as part of these realignment projects responsibility for the us can plastic container business was transferred to the company’s plastic packaging americas segment effective january 1 2007 

plastic packaging americas segment 

industry background 

demand for containers made of pet and polypropylene has increased in the beverage and food markets with improved barrier technologies and other advances this growth in demand is expected to continue while pet and polypropylene beverage containers compete against metal glass and cardboard the historical increase in the sales of pet containers has come primarily at the expense of glass containers and through new market introductions competition in the pet plastic container industry is intense and includes several national and regional suppliers and self manufacturers while ball is one of three major competitors in the polypropylene container industry service quality and price are important competitive factors with price being by far the most important resulting in poor margins for most of the industry the ability to produce customized differentiated plastic containers is also a key competitive factor 

ball’s operations 

plastic packaging americas accounted for 10 percent of ball’s consolidated net sales in 2007 we estimate our 2007 shipments of 6 billion plastic bottles to be approximately 9 percent of total us pet container shipments in addition this segment produced approximately 900 million food and specialty containers during 2007 the company operates eight plastic container manufacturing facilities in the us and one in canada 

most of ball’s pet containers are sold under longterm contracts to suppliers of bottled water and carbonated soft drinks including bottlers of pepsicola branded beverages and their affiliates that utilize consolidated purchasing groups most of our polypropylene containers are also sold under longterm contracts primarily to food packaging companies plastic beer containers are being produced for several of our customers and we are manufacturing plastic containers for the single serve juice and wine markets our line of heattek® pet plastic bottles for hotfilled beverages such as sports drinks and juices includes sizes from 8 ounces to 64 ounces 

ball’s emphasis in this segment is on customized differentiated containers this includes unique barrier plastics such as ball’s heattek® and sig technology ags plasmax ® heat set bottles the company is not investing in the carbonated soft drink and bottled water business which is a commodity business where return on investment has been unacceptable

aerospace and technologies segment 

ball’s aerospace and technologies segment which accounted for 11 percent of consolidated net sales in 2007 includes national defense solutions advanced technologies and products and civil and operational space businesses the segment develops spacecraft sensors and instruments radio frequency systems and other advanced technologies for the civil commercial and national security aerospace markets the majority of the aerospace and technologies business involves work under contracts generally from one to five years in duration as a prime contractor or subcontractor for the national aeronautics and space administration nasa the us department of defense dod and other us government agencies contracts funded by the various agencies of the federal government represented 84 percent of segment sales in 2007 the percentage representing us government sales decreased in 2007 due to higher revenues related to the worldview 1 and worldview 2 contracts with digitalglobe inc worldview 1 and worldview 2 are remote sensing satellites used to provide detailed maps and data about the earth’s surface for civil government mapping landuse planning disaster relief exploration defense and intelligence and visualization and simulation environments 

 

geopolitical events and executive and legislative branch priorities have yielded considerable growth opportunities in areas matching ball aerospace’s core capabilities however there is strong competition for new business the civil space systems defense solutions and operational space businesses include hardware software and services sold primarily to us customers with emphasis on space science and exploration environmental and earth sciences and defense and intelligence applications major contractual activities frequently involve the design manufacture and testing of satellites remote sensors and ground station control hardware and software as well as related services such as launch vehicle integration and satellite operations 

 

other hardware activities include target identification warning and attitude control systems and components cryogenic systems for reactant storage and sensor cooling devices using either closedcycle mechanical refrigerators or opencycle solid and liquid cryogens star trackers which are generalpurpose stellar attitude sensors and faststeering mirrors additionally the aerospace and technologies segment provides diversified technical services and products to government agencies prime contractors and commercial organizations for a broad range of information warfare electronic warfare avionics intelligence training and space systems needs 

 

backlog in the aerospace and technologies segment was 774 million and 886 million at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively and consists of the aggregate contract value of firm orders excluding amounts previously recognized as revenue the 2007 backlog includes 473 million expected to be recognized in revenues during 2008 with the remainder expected to be recognized in revenues thereafter unfunded amounts included in backlog for certain firm government orders which are subject to annual funding were 463 million and 492 million at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively yeartoyear comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations on december 24 2007 ball aerospace entered into an agreement to sell its small australian defense services business to a subsidiary of qinetiq plc this sale was completed on february 15 2008 

 

the company’s aerospace and technologies segment has contracts with the us government or its contractors that have standard termination provisions the government retains the right to terminate contracts at its convenience however if contracts are terminated in this manner ball is entitled to reimbursement for allowable costs and profits on authorized work performed through the date of termination us government contracts are also subject to reduction or modification in the event of changes in government requirements or budgetary constraints 

patents 

in the opinion of the company none of its active patents is essential to the successful operation of its business as a whole

sustainability and the environment 

sustainability is a systematic way of thinking about the things we do every day as a global company and how our activities interact with our world whether it is being more environmentally protective helping our customers become more sustainable or investing further in our communities we are committed to making ball a more sustainable enterprise environmental awareness a key component of sustainability is not new to us for many years we have found ways to reduce our own environmental footprint while providing a safe and healthy environment for our diverse workforce 

ball views the global emergence of sustainability as an opportunity in 2007 we started a formal sustainability initiative and have created a crossfunctional employee task force that is developing processes for capturing sustainabilityrelated data and identifying existing and new opportunities in all of our activities we are using the triple bottom line – environmental economic and social aspects of sustainability – in our approach key issues for our company include recycling climate change energy use water conservation diversity and regulated chemicals and emissions those areas of focus may be expanded or become more specific as we continue this process we plan to issue a corporate sustainability report in 2008 using the g3 reporting framework issued by the global reporting initiative as a reporting framework we are engaging our key stakeholders to help us develop and implement our plans as we move forward we will be posting additional information on our website compliance with federal state and local laws relating to protection of the environment has not had a material adverse effect upon the capital expenditures earnings or competitive position of the company as more fully described under item 3 “legal proceedings” the us environmental protection agency and various state environmental agencies have designated the company as a potentially responsible party along with numerous other companies for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites however the company’s information at this time indicates that these matters will not have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity results of operations or financial condition of the company 

 

legislation that would prohibit tax or restrict the sale or use of certain types of containers or would require diversion of solid wastes including packaging materials from disposal in landfills has been or may be introduced anywhere we operate while container legislation has been adopted in some jurisdictions similar legislation has been defeated in public referenda and legislative bodies in numerous others the company anticipates that continuing efforts will be made to consider and adopt such legislation in many jurisdictions in the future if such legislation were widely adopted it potentially could have a material adverse effect on the business of the company including its liquidity results of operations or financial condition as well as on the container manufacturing industry generally in view of the company’s substantial global sales and investment in metal and pet container manufacturing however the packages we produce are widely used and perform well in us states canadian provinces and european countries that have deposit systems 

employees 

at the end of december 2007 the company employed approximately 15500 people worldwide including 11100 employees in the us and 4400 in other countries there are an additional 1000 people employed in unconsolidated joint ventures in which ball participates approximately onethird of balls north american packaging plant employees are unionized and most of our european plant employees are union workers collective bargaining agreements with various unions in the us have terms of three to five years and those in europe have terms of one to two years the agreements expire at regular intervals and are customarily renewed in the ordinary course after bargaining between union and company representatives the company believes that its employee relations are good and that its safety training education and retention practices assist in enhancing employee satisfaction levels

 item 1a risk factors 

any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the loss of a key customer could have a significant negative impact on our sales 

while we have diversified our customer base we do sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major beverage packaged food and household product companies some of which operate in north america south america europe and asia 

although more than 70 percent of our customer contracts are longterm these contracts are terminable under certain circumstances such as our failure to meet quality or volume requirements because we depend on relatively few major customers our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss of any of these customers a reduction in the purchasing levels of these customers a strike or work stoppage by a significant number of these customers employees or an adverse change in the terms of the supply agreements with these customers 

the primary customers for our aerospace segment are us government agencies or their prime contractors these sales represented approximately 9 percent of balls consolidated 2007 net sales our contracts with these customers are subject to several risks including funding cuts and delays technical uncertainties budget changes competitive activity and changes in scope 

we face competitive risks from many sources that may negatively impact our profitability 

competition within the packaging industry is intense increases in productivity combined with existing or potential surplus capacity in the industry have maintained competitive pricing pressures the principal methods of competition in the general packaging industry are price service and quality some of our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources our current or potential competitors may offer products at a lower price or products that are deemed superior to ours 

  

page 9 of 94 

  

we are subject to competition from alternative products which could result in lower profits and reduced cash flows 

our metal packaging products are subject to significant competition from substitute products particularly plastic carbonated soft drink bottles made from pet single serve beer bottles and containers made of glass cardboard or other materials competition from plastic carbonated soft drink bottles is particularly intense in the united states and the united kingdom there can be no assurance that our products will successfully compete against alternative products which could result in a reduction in our profits or cash flow 

we have a narrow product range and our business would suffer if usage of our products decreased 

for the 12 months ended december 31 2007 63 percent of our consolidated net sales were from the sale of metal beverage cans and we expect to derive a significant portion of our future revenues from the sale of metal beverage cans our business would suffer if the use of metal beverage cans decreased accordingly broad acceptance by consumers of aluminum and steel cans for a wide variety of beverages is critical to our future success if demand for glass and pet bottles increases relative to cans or the demand for aluminum and steel cans does not develop as expected our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our business financial condition and results of operations are subject to risks resulting from increased international operations 

we derived 29 percent of our consolidated net sales from outside of the us for the year ended december 31 2007 this sizeable scope of international operations may lead to more volatile financial results and make it more difficult for us to manage our business reasons for this include but are not limited to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any of these factors could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations 

for the 12 months ended december 31 2007 72 percent of our consolidated net sales were attributable to operations with the us dollar as their functional currency 12 percent with the euro as the functional currency and 16 percent were attributable to operations having functional currencies other than the us dollar or the euro 

our reporting currency is the us dollar historically balls foreign operations including assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses have been denominated in various currencies other than the us dollar and we expect that our foreign operations will continue to be so denominated as a result the us dollar value of balls foreign operations has varied and will continue to vary with exchange rate fluctuations ball has been and is presently primarily exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate of the euro british pound canadian dollar polish zloty chinese renminbi brazilian real argentine peso and serbian dinar 

a decrease in the value of any of these currencies especially the euro british pound polish zloty chinese renminbi and canadian dollar relative to the us dollar could reduce our profits from foreign operations and the value of the net assets of our foreign operations when reported in us dollars in our financial statements this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations as reported in us dollars in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to currencies in which the earnings are generated may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations 

  

page 10 of 94 

  

we actively manage our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations particularly our exposure to fluctuations in the euro to us dollar exchange rate in order to mitigate the effect of foreign cash flow and reduce earnings volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes we primarily use forward contracts and options to manage our foreign currency exposures and as a result we experience gains and losses on these derivative positions offset in part by the impact of currency fluctuations on existing assets and liabilities our inability to properly manage our exposure to currency fluctuations could materially impact our results 

our business operating results and financial condition are subject to particular risks in certain regions of the world 

we may experience an operating loss in one or more regions of the world for one or more periods which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition moreover overcapacity which often leads to lower prices exists in a number of regions including north america south america and asia and may persist even if demand grows as growth continues in the european and other markets other overcapacity situations could occur as our competitors also expand to meet growth expectations our ability to manage such operational fluctuations and to maintain adequate longterm strategies in the face of such developments will be critical to our continued growth and profitability 

if we fail to retain key management and personnel we may be unable to implement our key objectives 

we believe that our future success depends in part on our experienced management team losing the services of key members of our management team could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet our objectives 

decreases in our ability to apply new technology and knowhow may affect our competitiveness 

our success depends partially on our ability to improve production processes and services we must also introduce new products and services to meet changing customer needs if we are unable to implement better production processes or to develop new products we may not be able to remain competitive with other manufacturers as a result our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

bad weather and climate changes may result in lower sales 

we manufacture packaging products primarily for beverages and foods unseasonably cool weather can reduce demand for certain beverages packaged in our containers in addition poor weather conditions or changes in climate that reduce crop yields of fruits and vegetables can adversely affect demand for our food containers the effects of global warming on climate could have various effects on the demand for our products in different regions around the world 

we are vulnerable to fluctuations in the supply and price of raw materials 

we purchase aluminum steel plastic resin and other raw materials and packaging supplies from several sources while all such materials are available from independent suppliers raw materials are subject to fluctuations in price attributable to a number of factors including general economic conditions commodity price fluctuations particularly aluminum on the london metal exchange the demand by other industries for the same raw materials and the availability of complementary and substitute materials although we enter into commodities purchase agreements from time to time and use derivative instruments to hedge our risk we cannot ensure that our current suppliers of raw materials will be able to supply us with sufficient quantities at reasonable prices increases in raw material costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations because our north american contracts often pass raw material costs directly on to the customer increasing raw material costs may not impact our nearterm profitability but could decrease our sales volumes over time in europe our contracts do not typically allow us to pass on increased raw material costs and we regularly use derivative agreements to manage this risk our hedging procedures may be insufficient and our results could be materially impacted if materials costs increase 

  

page 11 of 94 

  

prolonged work stoppages at plants with union employees could jeopardize our financial position 

as of december 31 2007 approximately one third of our employees in north america and most of our employees in europe were covered by one or more collective bargaining agreements these collective bargaining agreements have staggered expirations during the next several years although we consider our employee relations to be generally good a prolonged work stoppage or strike at any facility with union employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition we cannot ensure that upon the expiration of existing collective bargaining agreements new agreements will be reached without union action or that any such new agreements will be on terms satisfactory to us 

our business is subject to substantial environmental remediation and compliance costs 

our operations are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental hazards such as emissions to air discharges to water the handling and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes and the cleanup of hazardous substances the us environmental protection agency has designated us along with numerous other companies as a potentially responsible party for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites based on available information we do not believe that any costs incurred in connection with such sites will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations capital expenditures or competitive position 

there can be no assurance that any acquisition including the us can and alcan businesses will be successfully integrated into the acquiring company see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report for details of recent acquisitions 

while we have what we believe to be well designed integration plans if we cannot successfully integrate us can’s and alcan’s operations with those of ball we may experience material negative consequences to our business financial condition or results of operations the integration of companies that have previously been operated separately involves a number of risks including difficulties in assimilating and integrating new businesses additional demands on management expenses related to undisclosed or potential liabilities retention of major customers and other risks 

prior to the acquisitions ball us can and alcan operated as separate businesses we may not be able to achieve potential synergies or maintain the levels of revenue earnings or operating efficiency that each business had achieved or might achieve separately the successful integration of us can’s and alcan’s operations will depend on our ability to manage those operations realize opportunities for revenue growth presented by strengthened product offerings and to some degree eliminate redundant and excess costs 

if we were required to write down all or part of our goodwill our net earnings and net worth could be materially adversely affected 

we have 18631 million of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2007 we are required to periodically determine if our goodwill has become impaired in which case we would write down the impaired portion of our goodwill if we were required to write down all or a significant part of our goodwill our net earnings and net worth could be materially adversely affected 

if the investments in balls pension plans do not perform as expected we may have to contribute additional amounts to the plans which would otherwise be available to cover operating expenses 

ball maintains noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of its north american and united kingdom employees which we fund based on certain actuarial assumptions the plans ’ assets consist primarily of common stocks fixed income securities and in the us alternative investments our north american pension plans were substantially funded as of december 31 2007 however if the investments in the plans do not perform at expected levels or if longevity increases we will have to contribute additional funds to ensure that the plans will be able to pay out benefits as scheduled such an increase in funding could result in a decrease in our available cash flow and net earnings and the recognition of such an increase could result in a reduction to our shareholders ’ equity 

  

page 12 of 94 

  

our significant debt level could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the notes issued pursuant to our bond indentures 

on december 31 2007 we had total debt of 23586 million our ratio of earnings to fixed charges as of that date was 3 times see exhibit 12 attached to this annual report our level of debt could have important consequences including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition approximately onehalf of our debt bears interest at variable rates if market interest rates increase variablerate debt will create higher debt service requirements which would adversely affect our cash flow while we sometimes enter into agreements limiting our exposure any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk 

we will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and fund other investment opportunities our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 

our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt including the notes and to fund planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that may be beyond our control 

based on our current level of operations we believe our cash flow from operations available cash and available borrowings under our credit facilities will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the next several years barring any unforeseen circumstances beyond our control 

we cannot be certain that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facilities or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt including the notes or to fund our other liquidity needs we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt including the notes on or before maturity we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our debt including our credit facilities and our senior notes on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

we are subject to us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap under which we are often required to make changes in our accounting and reported results 

us gaap changes are routine and have become more frequent and significant over the past few years these changes can have significant effects on our reported results when compared to prior periods and may even require us to retrospectively adjust prior periods in the application of us gaap management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingencies and reported amounts of revenues and expenses these estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

management’s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes ball corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as “ball” or “the company” or “we” or “our” in the following discussion and analysis 

business overview 

ball corporation is one of the world’s leading suppliers of metal and plastic packaging to the beverage food and household products industries our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses and are manufactured in plants around the world we also supply aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers 

we sell our packaging products primarily to major beverage and food companies and producers of household products with which we have developed longterm customer relationships this is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of longterm supply contracts while we have diversified our customer base we do sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major companies in north america europe the people’s republic of china prc and argentina as do our equity joint ventures in brazil the us and the prc we also purchase raw materials from relatively few suppliers because of our customer and supplier concentration our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss of a major customer or supplier or a change in a supply agreement with a major customer or supplier although our longterm relationships and contracts mitigate these risks 

in the rigid packaging industry sales and earnings can be improved by reducing costs developing new products expanding volume and increasing prices in 2009 we expect to complete a project to upgrade and streamline our north american beverage can end manufacturing capabilities a project that in 2007 began to generate productivity gains and cost reductions in the metal beverage packaging americas segment while the us and canadian beverage container manufacturing industry is relatively mature the european asian and brazilian beverage can markets are growing and are expected to continue to grow we are capitalizing on this growth by increasing capacity in some of our european can manufacturing facilities and by announcing plans to establish a plant in india to better position the company in the european market the capacity from the firedamaged hassloch germany plant was replaced with a mix of steel beverage can manufacturing capacity in the hassloch plant and aluminum beverage can manufacturing capacity in the company’s hermsdorf germany plant all three lines were in commercial production by the end of the second quarter of 2007 additionally the company has announced plans for speeding up certain lines in europe and building a new plant in poland we are also considering additional can and end manufacturing capacity there and in the prc 

the company regularly evaluates expansion opportunities in growing international markets including existing and developing markets in europe the prc brazil and other parts of the world we recently announced our intention to build a beverage can manufacturing plant in india as well as the new plant in poland to meet the rapidly growing demand for beverage cans there and in central and eastern europe we also recently announced the company’s participation in a oneline metal beverage can plant in brazil this plant will be owned by ball’s unconsolidated 50 percent owned joint venture latapackball embalagens ltda and its construction will be financed by cash flows from the joint venture 

as part of our packaging strategy we are focused on developing and marketing new and existing products that meet the needs of our customers and the ultimate consumer these innovations include new shapes sizes opening features and other functional benefits of both metal and plastic packaging this packaging development activity helps us maintain and expand our supply positions with major beverage food and household products customers as part of this focus we are installing a new 24ounce can production line in our monticello indiana facility expected to be operational in mid2008 

ball’s consolidated earnings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations we attempt to mitigate this exposure through the use of derivative financial instruments as discussed in “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” within item 7a of this report 

  

page 22 of 94 

  

the primary customers for the products and services provided by our aerospace and technologies segment are us government agencies or their prime contractors it is possible that federal budget reductions and priorities or changes in agency budgets could limit future funding and new contract awards or delay or prolong contract performance 

we recognize sales under longterm contracts in the aerospace and technologies segment using the costtocost percentage of completion method of accounting our present contract mix consists of approximately 70 percent costtype contracts which are billed at our costs plus an agreed upon andor earned profit component while the remainder are fixed price contracts we include time and material contracts in the fixed price category because such contracts typically provide for the sale of engineering labor at fixed hourly rates failure to be awarded certain key contracts could adversely affect segment performance during 2008 compared to 2007 

throughout the period of contract performance we regularly reevaluate and if necessary revise our estimates of total contract revenue total contract cost and progress toward completion because of contract payment schedules limitations on funding and other contract terms our sales and accounts receivable for this segment include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed 

management uses various measures to evaluate company performance the primary financial metric we use is economic value added taxeffected operating earnings as defined by the company less a charge for net operating assets employed our goal is to increase economic value added on an annual basis other financial metrics we use are earnings before interest and taxes ebit earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda diluted earnings per share operating cash flow and free cash flow generally defined by the company as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures these financial measures may be adjusted at times for items that affect comparability between periods nonfinancial measures in the packaging segments include production efficiency and spoilage rates quality control figures environmental health and safety statistics and production and shipment volumes additional measures used to evaluate performance in the aerospace and technologies segment include contract revenue realization award and incentive fees realized proposal win rates and backlog including awarded contracted and funded backlog 

we recognize that attracting and retaining highly talented employees are essential to the success of ball and because of this we strive to pay employees competitively and encourage their ownership of the company’s common stock as part of a diversified portfolio for most management employees a meaningful portion of compensation is at risk as an incentive dependent upon economic valueadded operating performance for more senior positions more compensation is at risk through economic valueadded performance and various stock compensation plans through our employee stock purchase plan and 401k plan which matches employee contributions with ball common stock employees regardless of organizational level have opportunities to own ball stock 

consolidated sales and earnings 

the company has five reportable segments organized along a combination of product lines and geographic areas 1 metal beverage packaging americas 2 metal beverage packaging europeasia 3 metal food and household products packaging americas 4 plastic packaging americas and 5 aerospace and technologies we also have investments in companies in the us the prc and brazil which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and accordingly those results are not included in segment sales or earnings 

effective january 1 2007 a plastic pail product line with 2007 net sales of 521 million was transferred from the metal food and household products packaging americas segment to the plastic packaging americas segment prior periods have been retroactively adjusted to the current presentation

metal beverage packaging americas 

the metal beverage packaging americas segment consists of operations located in the us canada and puerto rico which manufacture metal container products used in beverage packaging during the second quarter of 2007 miller brewing company miller a us customer asserted various claims against a wholly owned subsidiary of the company primarily related to the pricing of the aluminum component of the containers supplied by the subsidiary and on october 4 2007 the dispute was settled in mediation miller received 856 million 518 million after tax on settlement of the dispute and ball retained all of miller’s beverage can and end supply through 2015 miller received a onetime payment of approximately 70 million 42 million after tax in january 2008 recorded on the december 31 2007 consolidated balance sheet in other current liabilities with the remainder of the settlement to be recovered over the life of the supply contract through 2015 

including the reduction in net sales resulting from the legal settlement this segment accounted for 37 percent of consolidated net sales in 2007 39 percent in 2006 sales were 6 percent higher in 2007 than in 2006 with flat volumes being offset by higher sales prices which were primarily due to rising aluminum prices and the pass through of various cost increases to customers these favorable factors were offset by the legal settlement which decreased sales by 3 percent in 2007 as compared to 2006 sales were 9 percent higher in 2006 than in 2005 due to an increase in beverage can shipments in excess of 4 percent coupled with higher aluminum prices passed through to our customers the higher can shipments over 2005 were driven by favorable weather in many parts of the us and canada as well as the promotion of 12ounce can packages by beer and soft drink companies based on publicly available information we estimate that our shipments of metal beverage containers were approximately 31 percent of total us and canadian shipments in 2007 we continue to focus efforts on the growing custom beverage can business which includes cans of different shapes diameters and fill volumes and cans with added functional attributes for new products and product line extensions 

including the effect of the legal settlement earnings in the segment were 2136 million in 2007 compared to 2694 million in 2006 and 2348 million in 2005 contributing to the higher segment earnings in 2007 before the legal settlement compared to 2006 were gains from sourcing of raw materials that totaled approximately 30 million also contributing were approximately 9 million of lower manufacturing costs related to the new end technology project and improved production efficiencies these gains were offset by increased repairs and maintenance costs and higher labor and other conversion costs a portion of which could not be passed through to our customers 

the third quarter of 2005 included a pretax charge of 193 million 117 million after tax related to a project to significantly upgrade and streamline our north american beverage can end manufacturing capabilities the project is expected to be largely completed in 2009 segment earnings growth in 2006 compared to 2005 before the end project charge although aided by 9 percent higher sales in 2006 was constrained by product mix and continued yearoveryear cost growth particularly higher energy other direct material and freight costs which combined were approximately 20 million higher than in 2005 

metal beverage packaging europeasia 

the metal beverage packaging europeasia segment includes metal beverage packaging products manufactured and sold in europe and asia as well as plastic containers manufactured and sold in asia this segment accounted for 26 percent of consolidated net sales in 2007 23 percent in 2006 ball packaging europe which represents an estimated 29 percent of total european metal beverage container manufacturing capacity has manufacturing plants located in germany the united kingdom france the netherlands poland and serbia 

segment sales in 2007 were 26 percent higher than in 2006 due to over 9 percent sales volume growth higher pricing and a 9 percent yearoveryear impact from the increase in the euro higher segment volumes were aided by overall market dynamics in europe that favor beverage cans as well as growth in europe of custom can volumes offsetting these favorable volume trends were the impacts of the colder and wetter than normal summer weather in many parts of europe 

  

page 24 of 94 

  

segment can shipments were more than 9 percent higher in 2006 than in 2005 higher segment sales volumes were aided by strong european demand favorable european weather germany hosting the world cup soccer championship during june and july 2006 and continued growth in the prc market segment sales which grew 12 percent in 2006 also benefited slightly from the strength of the euro the new beverage can plant in belgrade serbia built to serve the growing demand for beverage cans in southern and eastern europe became fully operational during the third quarter of 2005 the serbian plant was constructed to accommodate a second can production line and a can end manufacturing module for future growth ball has announced its intention to increase capacity in this segment through the construction of a beverage can manufacturing plant in india as well as a second beverage can plant in poland 

earnings in the segment were 2561 million in 2007 2687 million in 2006 and 1805 million in 2005 segment earnings in 2006 included a 755 million property insurance gain related to a fire at the company’s hassloch germany metal beverage can plant further details are provided below the fourth quarter of 2005 included a 93 million gain primarily resulting from the final settlement of all tax obligations related to liquidating prc operations for amounts less than originally estimated first quarter 2005 segment earnings included a 34 million expense for the write off of the remaining carrying value of an equity investment in the prc 

segment earnings in 2007 compared to 2006 excluding the 755 million property insurance gain increased due to a combination of 76 million in net margin increases from higher sales volumes and price recovery initiatives 16 million from cost control programs and 13 million due to a stronger euro these earnings improvements were partially offset by 159 million of lower business interruption insurance recognition in 2007 and 26 million of other higher costs segment earnings in 2006 were higher than in 2005 due largely to 9 percent sales higher volumes certain price recovery initiatives and effective manufacturing and selling general and administrative cost controls these gains were partially offset by higher raw material freight and energy costs and pricecost compression in the prc 

on april 1 2006 a fire in the metal beverage can plant in hassloch germany damaged a significant portion of the building and machinery and equipment the property insurance proceeds recorded for the year ended december 31 2006 which were based on replacement cost were €863 million 1093 million of which €26 million 324 million was received in april 2006 €227 million 289 million was received in october 2006 and the remainder of €376 million 486 million which was recorded in other longterm assets at december 31 2006 was received in january 2007 a €267 million 338 million fixed asset write down was recorded to reflect the estimated impairment of the assets damaged as a result of the fire as a result a pretax gain of €596 million 755 million was recorded in the 2006 consolidated statement of earnings to reflect the difference between the net book value of the impaired assets and the property insurance proceeds an additional €272 million 351 million and €40 million 51 million were recorded in cost of sales in 2007 and 2006 respectively for insurance recoveries related to business interruption costs as well as €113 million 143 million in 2006 to offset cleanup costs 

 

metal food and household products packaging americas 

the metal food and household products packaging americas segment consists of operations located in the us canada and argentina the company acquired us can corporation us can on march 27 2006 and with that acquisition added to its metal food can business the production and sale of aerosol cans paint cans plastic pails and decorative specialty cans effective january 1 2007 responsibility for the plastic pail product line with 2007 net sales of 521 million was transferred to the plastic packaging americas segment accordingly 2006 segment amounts have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the transfer 

segment sales in 2007 constituted 16 percent of consolidated net sales 17 percent in 2006 and were 4 percent higher than 2006 sales the higher 2007 sales were impacted by 10 percent for the inclusion of a full year’s sales from the acquisition of us can partially offset by lost business that resulted in a 2007 sales decline of 3 percent as well as customer operating issues in food cans including a fire in a customer’s factory and unfavorable weather conditions in the midwest 

  

page 25 of 94 

  

segment sales in 2006 were 38 percent higher than 2005 sales the primary reason for the increase was 45 percent higher sales due to the acquisition of us can combined with the pass through of higher raw material costs partially offset by 12 percent lower third quarter food can volumes during 2007 2006 and 2005 we were not able to pass through all of the steel price increases and surcharges levied by steel producers and this resulted in margin compression based on publicly available trade information we estimate our 2007 shipments of 56 billion steel food containers and 16 billion aerosol containers to be approximately 18 percent and 51 percent of total us and canadian metal food container and steel aerosol container shipments respectively 

a segment loss of 8 million was incurred in 2007 compared to earnings of 24 million in 2006 and 191 million in 2005 these amounts included pretax charges of 442 million in 2007 355 million in 2006 and 112 million in 2005 respectively for business consolidation activities the 4 percent lower earnings in 2007 compared to 2006 before the business consolidation activity charges were due to increased steel and coating material costs partially offset by improved manufacturing performance in 2007 and higher cost of sales in the second quarter of 2006 related to 61 million of purchase accounting adjustments for inventory valuations associated with the acquired us can finished goods inventory higher sales volumes related to the us can acquisition helped improve segment earnings in the last nine months of 2006 despite the negative impact of lower food can volumes attributable to the loss of a customer in late 2005 and a poor salmon harvest in 2006 additionally segment earnings in 2006 were reduced by the 61 million of purchase accounting adjustments discussed previously partially offset by lower freight and other direct material costs of 4 million while pricing pressures continue on all of our raw materials other direct materials and freight and utility costs we continue to seek price increases in the market place to improve our margins 

on october 24 2007 ball announced plans to close two manufacturing facilities and to exit the custom and decorative tinplate can business located in baltimore maryland ball will close its food and household products packaging facilities in tallapoosa georgia and commerce california both of which manufacture aerosol and general line cans the two plant closures will result in a net reduction in manufacturing capacity of 10 production lines including the relocation of two highspeed aerosol lines into existing ball facilities and will allow us to supply customers from a consolidated asset base when completed throughout 2008 the actions are expected to yield annualized pretax cost savings in excess of 15 million and improve the aerosol plant utilization rate to more than 85 percent from about 70 percent the cash costs of these actions are expected to be offset by proceeds on asset dispositions and tax recoveries a pretax charge of 419 million 254 million after tax was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2007 related to these closures we also recorded a 23 million 14 million after tax pension annuity expense related to a previously closed plant 

in october 2006 the company announced plans to close two manufacturing facilities in north america by the end of that year as part of the realignment of the metal food and household products packaging americas segment following the acquisition of us can earlier in the year the company closed a leased facility in alliance ohio which was one of 10 manufacturing locations acquired from us can and a plant in burlington ontario which was part of the metal food can operations prior to the us can acquisition the closure of the ohio plant was treated as an opening balance sheet item a pretax charge of 355 million 287 million after tax was recorded in 2006 primarily related to the burlington closure for employee termination and pension costs plant decommissioning costs and fixed asset impairment as well as the shut down of a metal food can manufacturing line in the whitby ontario plant when the burlington building is sold the estimated costs of the closures will be cash flow neutral after tax benefits and anticipated proceeds 

the year ended december 31 2005 included a net pretax charge of 112 million 75 million after tax for pension severance and other employee benefit costs related to a reduction in force in the burlington plant combined with the closure of a threepiece food can manufacturing plant in quebec 

the company continues to evaluate the segment’s manufacturing structure and expects to identify other opportunities to improve efficiencies additional details regarding business consolidation activities are available in note 5 accompanying the consolidated financial statements included within item 8 of this annual report

plastic packaging americas 

the plastic packaging americas segment consists of operations located in the us and canada that manufacture polyethylene terephthalate pet and polypropylene plastic container products used mainly in beverage and food packaging as well as high density polyethylene and polypropylene containers for industrial and household product applications on march 28 2006 ball acquired certain north american plastic bottle container assets from alcan packaging alcan including two plastic container manufacturing plants in the us and one in canada as well as certain manufacturing equipment and other assets from other alcan facilities effective january 1 2007 the plastic packaging americas segment assumed responsibility for plastic pail assets acquired as part of the us can acquisition accordingly 2006 segment amounts have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the transfer 

segment sales in 2007 comprised 10 percent of consolidated net sales 10 percent in 2006 and increased 8 percent compared to 2006 primarily due to an increase of 7 percent related to the march 2006 acquisition of alcan and the inclusion of the acquired us can plastic pail business as well as an increase of 3 percent for higher sales volumes segment sales in 2006 increased 42 percent compared to 2005 including 34 percent related to plant and other asset acquisitions from alcan and us can and 6 percent related to higher sales volumes in view of the substandard performance related to our pet soft drink margins we continue to focus on price recovery initiatives as well as our pet development efforts in the custom hotfill beer wine flavored alcoholic beverage and specialty container markets in the polypropylene plastic container arena development efforts are primarily focused on custom packaging markets 

segment earnings were 259 million in 2007 283 million in 2006 and 167 million in 2005 earnings were lower in 2007 than in 2006 primarily due to lower sales margins related to approximately 5 million of customer pricing concessions and 2 million of higher labor and overhead costs the earnings inhibitors were partially offset by approximately 2 million from volume growth in specialty pet sales combined with the incremental margin impact of sales in the first quarter of 2007 related to the acquired alcan and us can plants 

segment earnings in 2006 were higher than in 2005 largely due to the margin impact of the incremental sales related to the alcan and us can acquisitions partially offset by 9 million of higher energy and labor costs and approximately 2 million incurred for a litigation claim that was favorably resolved in july 2006 earnings in the second quarter of 2006 also included purchase accounting adjustments of 12 million which increased cost of sales due to the valuation of inventories associated with the acquired alcan finished goods inventory 

we estimate our 2007 shipments of 6 billion pet plastic bottles to be approximately 9 percent of total us and canadian pet container shipments in addition the plastic packaging americas segment produced approximately 900 million food and specialty containers during 2007 

aerospace and technologies 

aerospace and technologies segment sales represented 11 percent of 2007 consolidated net sales 10 percent in 2006 and were 17 percent higher than in 2006 sales in 2006 were 3 percent lower than in 2005 the higher sales in 2007 were due to new programs cost overruns and increased scope on previously awarded contracts with 58 million attributable to the worldview and other commercial space operations contracts lower sales in 2006 compared to 2005 were largely due to contracts being completed during the period as well as the impact of government funding reductions and program delays the aerospace and technologies business won a number of large strategic contracts and delivered a considerable amount of sophisticated space and defense instrumentation throughout the threeyear period 

segment earnings were 646 million in 2007 50 million in 2006 and 547 million in 2005 earnings improvement in 2007 was primarily due to higher net sales particularly 12 million related to the worldview and other commercial space contracts an improved contract mix and better program execution earnings in 2006 were negatively affected by lower sales due to program delays and unfavorable contract mix the first quarter of 2005 included expense of 38 million for the write down to net realizable value of an equity investment in an aerospace company this investment was sold in october 2005 for approximately its carrying value

some of the segment’s highprofile contracts include the worldview 1 and worldview 2 advanced commercial remote sensing satellites the james webb space telescope a successor to the hubble space telescope the spacebased space surveillance system which will detect and track space objects such as satellites and orbital debris npoess the nextgeneration satellite weather monitoring system and a number of antennas for the joint strike fighter 

sales to the us government either directly as a prime contractor or indirectly as a subcontractor represented 84 percent of segment sales in 2007 90 percent of segment sales in 2006 and 87 percent in 2005 contracted backlog for the aerospace and technologies segment at december 31 2007 and 2006 was 774 million and 886 million respectively yeartoyear comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations 

additional segment information 

for additional information regarding the company’s segments see the summary of business segment information in note 2 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report the charges recorded for business consolidation activities were based on estimates by ball management actuaries and others and were developed from information available at the time if actual outcomes vary from the estimates the differences will be reflected in current period earnings in the consolidated statement of earnings and identified as business consolidation gains and losses additional details about our business consolidation activities and associated costs are provided in note 5 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative sga expenses were 3237 million 2872 million and 2338 million for 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively contributing to higher expenses in 2007 compared to 2006 were 45 million of additional sga from the us can acquisition higher research and development costs and aerospace bid and proposal costs of 94 million increased sales and marketing efforts of 54 million and 158 million of compensation and benefit increases including yearoveryear incentive compensation costs also a 58 million outofperiod foreign currency adjustment was included in sga expenses in the first quarter of 2006 discussed in further detail in note 19 accompanying the consolidated financial statements included within item 8 of this report 

the increase in sga expenses in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily the result of 20 million of incremental sga after realized synergies from the acquired us can operations the 58 million outofperiod foreign currency adjustment higher expense of 63 million associated with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 2 million for higher rates associated with the company’s receivables sales agreement 5 million of increased legal fees related to patent litigation 67 million for an initial marktomarket adjustment to one of the company’s deferred compensation stock plans due to a plan amendment as well as compensation and benefit increases 

interest and taxes 

consolidated interest expense was 1494 million in 2007 1344 million in 2006 and 1164 million including debt refinancing costs of 193 million in 2005 the higher expense for each successive year was primarily due to the additional borrowings used to finance the acquisitions of us can and the alcan assets combined with higher interest rates in 2007 the debt refinancing costs in 2005 of 193 million were costs associated with the refinancing of the company’s senior credit facilities and the redemption in the last half of 2005 of the company’s 775 senior notes which were due in august 2006 

ball’s consolidated effective income tax rate for 2007 was 263 percent compared to 294 percent in 2006 and 292 percent in 2005 the lower effective rate in 2007 was the result of earnings mix higher foreign earnings taxed at lower rates and net tax benefit adjustments of 172 million recorded in the third quarter of 2007 as compared to 64 million in 2006 these net tax benefit adjustments were the result of enacted income tax rate reductions in germany and the united kingdom and a tax loss related to the company’s canadian operations these benefits were offset by a tax provision to adjust for the final settlement negotiations concluded in the quarter with the internal revenue service irs related to a companyowned life insurance plan discussed below based on current estimates the 2008 effective income tax rate is expected to be around 33 percent 

  

page 28 of 94 

  

during 2007 the company concluded final settlement negotiations with the irs on the deductibility of interest expense on incurred loans from a companyowned life insurance plan an additional accrual of 7 million was made in the third quarter to adjust the accrued liability to the final settlement of 184 million including interest for the years 20002004 which were under examination and for the unaudited years 20052007 this settlement included agreement on the prospective treatment of interest deductibility on the policy loans which will not have a significant impact on earnings per share cash flow or liquidity in future periods further details are available in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report 

while the effective tax rates for 2006 and 2005 are similar the 2006 rate was impacted by a tax benefit of 81 million associated with a foreign exchange loss as a result of the change in the functional currency of a european subsidiary in the local statutory accounts the onetime benefit was somewhat offset by a higher foreign tax rate differential due to taxation of the german property insurance gain at the marginal rate of 39 percent and a valuation allowance on a canadian net operating loss resulting from the 2006 business consolidation costs the 2005 rate was impacted by the tax benefit recorded on the repatriation of foreign earnings at legislated reduced rates plus the tax benefit on business consolidation costs applied at the higher marginal rate 

results of equity affiliates 

equity in the earnings of affiliates is primarily attributable to our 50 percent ownership in packaging investments in the us and brazil earnings were 129 million in 2007 147 million in 2006 and 155 million in 2005

for information regarding the company’s critical and significant accounting policies as well as recent accounting pronouncements see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows and capital expenditures 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities and external borrowings we believe that cash flows from operations and cash provided by shortterm and revolver borrowings when necessary will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements scheduled principal and interest payments on debt dividend payments and anticipated capital expenditures however our liquidity could be impacted significantly by a decrease in demand for our products which could arise from competitive circumstances or any of the other factors we describe in item 1a “risk factors” 

cash flows from operating activities were 673 million in 2007 compared to 4014 million in 2006 and 5588 million in 2005 the improvement over 2006 was primarily due to higher net earnings before the legal settlement in 2007 and the insurance gain in 2006 related to the hassloch fire the improvement in 2007 was also the result of reduced changes in working capital components and lower income tax payments partially offset by higher pension contributions 

cash flows from operating activities in 2006 were negatively affected by higher cash pension funding and higher working capital levels compared to the prior year the higher working capital was a combination of higher than planned raw material inventory levels higher income tax payments and higher accounts receivable balances the latter resulting primarily from the repayment of a portion of the accounts receivable securitization program and late payments from customers in europe 

management internally uses a free cash flow measure 1 to evaluate the company’s operating results 2 to plan stockbuy back levels 3 to evaluate strategic investments and 4 to evaluate the company’s ability to incur and service debt free cash flow is not a defined term under us generally accepted accounting principles and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures the company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less additions to property plant and equipment capital spending free cash flow is typically derived directly from the company’s cash flow statements however it may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods an example of such an item included in 2006 is the property insurance proceeds for the replacement of the firedamaged assets in our hassloch germany plant which 

  

page 29 of 94 

  

are included in capital spending amounts another example is the company’s decision in 2007 to contribute an additional 445 million 273 million to its pension plans as part of its overall debt reduction plan 

based on this our consolidated free cash flow is summarized as follows 

 

based on information currently available we estimate cash flows from operating activities for 2008 to be approximately 650 million capital spending to be approximately 350 million and free cash flow to be in the 300 million range capital spending of 2599 million net of 486 million in insurance recoveries in 2007 was below depreciation and amortization expense of 281 million we continue to invest capital in our best performing operations including projects to increase custom can capabilities improve beverage can and end making productivity and add more beverage can capacity in europe as well as expenditures in the aerospace and technologies segment of the 350 million of planned capital spending for 2008 approximately 180 million will be spent on topline sales growth projects 

debt facilities and refinancing 

interestbearing debt at december 31 2007 decreased 931 million to 23586 million from 24517 million at december 31 2006 the 2007 debt decrease from 2006 was primarily attributed to debt payments offset by higher foreign exchange rates 

at december 31 2007 705 million was available under the company’s multicurrency revolving credit facilities the company also had 345 million of shortterm uncommitted credit facilities available at the end of the year of which 497 million was outstanding 

on october 13 2005 ball refinanced its senior secured credit facilities and during the third and fourth quarters of 2005 ball redeemed its 775 senior notes due august 2006 primarily through the drawdown of funds under the new credit facilities the refinancing and redemption resulted in a pretax debt refinancing charge of 193 million 123 million after tax to reflect the call premium associated with the senior notes and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs 

the company has a receivables sales agreement that provides for the ongoing revolving sale of a designated pool of trade accounts receivable of ball’s north american packaging operations up to 250 million the agreement qualifies as offbalance sheet financing under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 140 as amended by sfas no 156 net funds received from the sale of the accounts receivable totaled 170 million and 2013 million at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively and are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets 

the company was not in default of any loan agreement at december 31 2007 and has met all payment obligations the us note agreements bank credit agreement and industrial development revenue bond agreements contain certain restrictions relating to dividends investments financial ratios guarantees and the incurrence of additional indebtedness 

additional details about the company’s receivables sales agreement and debt are available in notes 7 and 13 respectively accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report

contributions to the company’s defined benefit pension plans not including the unfunded german plans are expected to be 49 million in 2008 this estimate may change based on plan asset performance benefit payments related to these plans are expected to be 66 million 70 million 74 million 77 million and 82 million for the years ending december 31 2008 through 2012 respectively and a total of 473 million for the years 2013 through 2017 payments to participants in the unfunded german plans are expected to be approximately 26 million in each of the years 2008 through 2012 and a total of 136 million for the years 2013 through 2017 

 

in accordance with united kingdom pension regulations ball has provided an £8 million guarantee to the plan for its defined benefit plan in the united kingdom if the company’s credit rating falls below specified levels ball will be required to either 1 contribute an additional £8 million to the plan 2 provide a letter of credit to the plan in that amount or 3 if imposed by the appropriate regulatory agency provide a lien on company assets in that amount for the benefit of the plan the guarantee can be removed upon approval by both ball and the pension plan trustees 

 

our share repurchase program in 2007 was 2113 million net of issuances compared to 457 million net repurchases in 2006 and 3581 million in 2005 the net repurchases included the 519 million settlement on january 5 2007 of a forward contract entered into in december 2006 for the repurchase of 1200000 shares however the 2007 net repurchases did not include a forward contract entered into in december 2007 for the repurchase of 675000 shares the contract was settled on january 7 2008 for 31 million in cash 

on december 12 2007 in a privately negotiated transaction ball entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement to buy 100 million of its common shares using cash on hand and available borrowings the company advanced the 100 million on january 7 2008 and received approximately 2 million shares which represented 90 percent of the total shares as calculated using the previous day’s closing price the exact number of shares to be repurchased under the agreement which will be determined on the settlement date no later than june 5 2008 is subject to an adjustment based on a weighted average price calculation for the period between the initial purchase date and the settlement date the company has the option to settle the contract in either cash or shares including the settlements of the forward share purchase contract and the accelerated share repurchase agreement we expect to repurchase approximately 300 million of our common shares net of issuances in 2008 

annual cash dividends paid on common stock were 40 cents per share in 2007 2006 and 2005 total dividends paid were 406 million in 2007 41 million in 2006 and 425 million in 2005

contingencies 

the company is subject to various risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of business due in part to the competitive nature of the industries in which we participate our operations in developing markets outside the us changing commodity prices for the materials used in the manufacture of our products and changing capital markets where practicable we attempt to reduce these risks and uncertainties through the establishment of risk management policies and procedures including at times the use of derivative financial instruments as explained in item 7a of this report 

from time to time the company is subject to routine litigation incident to its business additionally the us environmental protection agency has designated ball as a potentially responsible party along with numerous other companies for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites our information at this time does not indicate that these matters will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity results of operations or financial condition of the company 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period future events could affect these estimates see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report for a summary of the company’s critical and significant accounting policies 

the us and european economies have experienced minor general inflation during the past several years management believes that evaluation of ball’s performance during the periods covered by these consolidated financial statements should be based upon historical financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

financial instruments and risk management 

in the ordinary course of business we employ established risk management policies and procedures to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices interest rates foreign currencies and prices of the company’s common stock in regard to common share repurchases although the instruments utilized involve varying degrees of credit market and interest risk the counterparties to the agreements are expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements 

we have estimated our market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis market risk exposure has been defined as the changes in fair value of derivative instruments financial instruments and commodity positions to test the sensitivity of our market risk exposure we have estimated the changes in fair value of market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in market prices or rates the results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized below 

commodity price risk 

we manage our north american commodity price risk in connection with market price fluctuations of aluminum primarily by entering into container sales contracts that include aluminumbased pricing terms that generally reflect price fluctuations under our commercial supply contracts for aluminum purchases the terms include fixed floating or passthrough aluminum component pricing this matched pricing affects substantially all of our metal beverage packaging americas net sales we also at times use certain derivative instruments such as option and forward contracts as cash flow and fair value hedges of commodity price risk where there is not a passthrough arrangement in the sales contract 

most of the plastic packaging americas sales contracts include provisions to fully passthrough resin cost changes as a result we believe we have minimal exposure related to changes in the cost of plastic resin most metal food and household products packaging americas sales contracts either include provisions permitting us to pass through some or all steel cost changes we incur or they incorporate annually negotiated steel costs in 2007 and 2006 we were able to pass through to our customers the majority of steel cost increases we anticipate that we will be able to pass through the majority of the steel price increases that occur through the end of 2008 

in europe and asia the company manages the aluminum and steel raw material commodity price risks through annual and longterm contracts for the purchase of the materials as well as certain sales of containers that reduce the company ’ s exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices within the current year these purchase and sales contracts include fixed price floating and passthrough pricing arrangements we also use forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges to manage future aluminum price risk and foreign exchange exposures for those sales contracts where there is not a passthrough arrangement to minimize the company’s exposure to significant price changes we also use option contracts to limit the impacts of european inflation in certain multiyear contracts 

considering the effects of derivative instruments the market’s ability to accept price increases and the company’s commodity price exposures a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the company’s steel aluminum and resin prices could result in an estimated 6 million aftertax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period additionally if foreign currency exchange rates were to change adversely by 10 percent we estimate there could be a 12 million aftertax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period for foreign currency exposures on raw materials actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates sensitivity to foreign currency exposures related to metal increased over prior years due to an increase in metal purchases and related payables at our foreign operations which are subject to foreign currency fluctuations 

the company is also exposed to fluctuations in prices for utilities such as natural gas and electricity as well as the cost of diesel fuel as a component of freight cost a hypothetical 10 percent increase in our utility prices could result in an estimated 10 million aftertax reduction of net earnings over a oneyear period a hypothetical 10 percent increase in our diesel fuel surcharge could result in an estimated 2 million aftertax reduction of net earnings over the same period actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates 

  

page 34 of 94 

  

interest rate risk 

our objective in managing our exposure to interest rate changes is to manage the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we use a variety of interest rate swaps collars and options to manage our mix of floating and fixedrate debt interest rate instruments held by the company at december 31 2007 included payfixed interest rate swaps and interest rate collars payfixed swaps effectively convert variable rate obligations to fixed rate instruments collars create an upper and lower threshold within which interest rates will fluctuate 

based on our interest rate exposure at december 31 2007 assumed floating rate debt levels throughout 2008 and the effects of derivative instruments a 100 basis point increase in interest rates could result in an estimated 8 million aftertax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates and the timing of these changes 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to protect foreign cash flows and earnings from changes associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes through the use of cash flow hedges in addition we manage foreign earnings translation volatility through the use of foreign currency options our foreign currency translation risk results from the european euro british pound canadian dollar polish zloty chinese renminbi brazilian real argentine peso and serbian dinar we face currency exposures in our global operations as a result of purchasing raw materials in us dollars and to a lesser extent in other currencies sales contracts are negotiated with customers to reflect cost changes and where there is not a foreign exchange passthrough arrangement the company uses forward and option contracts to manage foreign currency exposures 

considering the company’s derivative financial instruments outstanding at december 31 2007 and the currency exposures a hypothetical 10 percent reduction us dollar strengthening in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the us dollar could result in an estimated 23 million aftertax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period this amount includes the 12 million currency exposure discussed above in the “commodity price risk” section this hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would also reduce our forecasted average debt balance by 84 million actual changes in market prices or rates may differ from hypothetical changes 

common share repurchases 

in connection with the company’s ongoing share repurchases the company periodically sells put options which give the purchasers of those options the right to sell shares of the company’s common stock to the company on specified dates at specified prices upon the exercise of those options our objective in selling put options is to lower the average purchase price of acquired shares there were no put option contracts outstanding at the end of 2007 

on december 3 2007 ball entered into a forward repurchase agreement for the purchase of 675000 shares of its common stock this agreement was settled for 31 million on january 7 2008 and the shares were delivered that day on december 12 2007 we also entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement for approximately 100 million the agreement provided for the delivery of approximately 2 million shares which represented 90 percent of the total estimated shares to ultimately be delivered the 100 million was paid on january 7 2008 at the time the shares were delivered the remaining shares and average price per share will be determined at the conclusion of the contract which is expected to occur no later than june 5 2008

ball corporation was organized in 1880 and incorporated in indiana in 1922 its principal executive offices are located at 10 longs peak drive broomfield colorado 800212510 the terms ball the company we and our as used herein refer to ball corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries 

ball is a manufacturer of metal and plastic packaging primarily for beverages foods and household products and a supplier of aerospace and other technologies and services to government and commercial customers 

information pertaining to the business of the company 

the company has five reportable segments organized along a combination of product lines and geographic areas 1 metal beverage packaging americas 2 metal beverage packaging europeasia 3 metal food and household products packaging americas 4 plastic packaging americas and 5 aerospace and technologies prior periods required to be shown in this annual report on form 10k annual report have been conformed to the current presentation 

a substantial part of our north american and international packaging sales are made directly to companies in packaged beverage and food businesses including sabmiller and bottlers of pepsicola and cocacola branded beverages and their affiliates that utilize consolidated purchasing groups sales to sabmiller plc pepsico inc and cocacola enterprises represented 11 percent 9 percent and 9 percent of ball’s consolidated net sales respectively for the year ended december 31 2006 additional details about sales to major customers are included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements which can be found in item 8 of this annual report “financial statements and supplementary data” 

north american packaging segments 

our principal businesses in north america are the manufacture and sale of aluminum steel polyethylene terephthalate pet and polypropylene containers primarily for beverages foods and household products our packaging products are sold in highly competitive markets primarily based on quality service and price the north american packaging business is capital intensive requiring significant investment in machinery and equipment profitability is sensitive to selling prices production volumes labor transportation utility and warehousing costs as well as the availability and price of raw materials such as aluminum steel plastic resin and other direct materials these raw materials are generally available from several sources and we have secured what we consider to be adequate supplies and are not experiencing any shortages we believe we have limited our exposure related to changes in the costs of aluminum steel and plastic resin as a result of 1 the inclusion of provisions in most aluminum container sales contracts to pass through aluminum cost changes as well as the use of derivative instruments 2 the inclusion of provisions in certain steel container sales contracts to pass through steel cost changes and the existence of certain other steel container sales contracts that incorporate annually negotiated metal costs and 3 the inclusion of provisions in substantially all plastic container sales contracts to pass through resin cost changes in 2006 we were able to pass through the majority of steel cost increases levied by producers and we continually attempt to reduce manufacturing and other material costs as much as possible while raw materials and energy sources such as natural gas and electricity may from time to time be in short supply or unavailable due to external factors and the pass through of steel costs to our customers may be limited in some instances we cannot predict the timing or effects if any of such occurrences on future operations 

research and development rd efforts in the north american packaging segments are primarily directed toward packaging innovation specifically the development of new sizes and types of metal and plastic beverage food and household product containers as well as new uses for the current containers other research and development efforts in these segments seek to improve manufacturing efficiencies our north american packaging rd activities are conducted in the ball technology and innovation center btic located in westminster colorado including the relocated rd activities relating to the plastic bottle assets acquired march 28 2006 from alcan packaging

metal beverage packaging americas 

metal beverage packaging americas represents ball’s largest segment accounting for 39 percent of consolidated net sales in 2006 decorated twopiece aluminum beverage cans are produced at 16 manufacturing facilities in the us and one each in canada and puerto rico can ends are produced within three of the us facilities as well as in a fourth facility that manufactures only ends metal beverage containers are primarily sold under multiyear supply contracts to fillers of carbonated soft drinks beer energy drinks and other beverages sales volumes of metal beverage containers in north america tend to be highest during the period from april through september 

through rocky mountain metal container llc a 5050 joint venture which is accounted for as an equity investment ball and coors brewing company coors a wholly owned subsidiary of molson coors brewing company operate beverage can and end manufacturing facilities in golden colorado the joint venture supplies coors with beverage cans and ends for its golden colorado brewery and supplies ends to its shenandoah virginia filling location ball receives management fees and technology licensing fees under agreements with the joint venture in addition to beverage containers supplied to coors from the joint venture ball supplies from its own facilities substantially all of coors’ metal container requirements for its shenandoah virginia filling location as well as other sizes of containers not manufactured by the joint venture 

we also participate in a 5050 joint venture in brazil that manufactures aluminum cans and ends and is accounted for as an equity investment 

based on publicly available industry information we estimate that our north american metal beverage container shipments in 2006 of approximately 33 billion cans were approximately 32 percent of total us and canadian shipments of metal beverage containers three producers manufacture substantially all of the remaining metal beverage containers two of these producers and three other independent producers also manufacture metal beverage containers in mexico available information indicates that north american metal beverage container shipments have been relatively flat during the past several years although in 2006 the us industry experienced a 23 percent growth in can shipments it is difficult to predict whether this higher growth rate will become a trend 

beverage container production capacity in the us canada and mexico exceeds demand in order to more closely balance capacity and demand within our business from time to time we consolidate our can and end manufacturing capacity into fewer more efficient facilities we also attempt to efficiently match capacity with the changes in customer demand for our packaging products to that end during 2005 ball commenced a project to upgrade and streamline its north american beverage can end manufacturing capabilities a project expected to result in productivity improvements and reduced manufacturing costs in connection with these activities the company recorded a pretax charge of 193 million 117 million after tax in the third quarter of 2005 we have installed the first three production modules in this multiyear project and the fourth and fifth modules are in the installation phase and the project is expected to be fully completed in 2008 in connection with this project the can end manufacturing operations at the reidsville north carolina plant were shut down during the fourth quarter of 2006 

the aluminum beverage container continues to compete aggressively with other packaging materials in the beer and carbonated soft drink industries the glass bottle has shown resilience in the packaged beer industry while carbonated soft drink and beer industry use of pet containers has grown in canada metal beverage containers have captured significantly lower percentages of the packaged beverage industry than in the us particularly in the packaged beer industry 

metal food  household products packaging americas 

metal food and household products packaging americas accounted for 18 percent of consolidated net sales in 2006 the two major product lines in this segment are steel food and aerosol containers aerosol containers were added with the acquisition of us can corporation us can on march 27 2006 discussed below ball produces twopiece and threepiece steel food containers and ends for packaging vegetables fruit soups meat seafood nutritional products pet food and other products these containers and ends are manufactured in 9 plants in the us and canada and sold primarily to food processors in north america sales volumes of metal food containers in north america tend to be highest from june through october as a result of seasonal vegetable and salmon packs we estimate our 2006 shipments of more than 6 billion steel food containers to be approximately 20 percent of total us and canadian metal food container shipments 

page 2 of 98 

on march 27 2006 ball corporation acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of us can for consideration of 444756 ball common shares together with the repayment of 598 million of existing us can debt including 27 million of bond redemption premiums and fees the acquired business manufactures and sells aerosol cans paint cans plastic containers and custom and specialty containers in 10 plants in the us and is the largest manufacturer of aerosol cans in north america in addition the company manufactures and sells aerosol cans in two plants in argentina the acquired operations employ 2300 people and have annual sales of approximately 600 million the acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and accordingly its results have been included in our consolidated financial statements in the metal food and household products packaging americas segment from march 27 2006 we estimate the us can aerosol business accounts for approximately 53 percent of total annual us and canadian steel aerosol shipments 

in december 2006 as part of a product realignment plan the company closed a leased facility in alliance ohio which was one of the 10 manufacturing locations acquired from us can and a metal food can manufacturing plant in burlington ontario which was part of the metal food can operations prior to the us can acquisition the closure of the alliance plant was treated as an opening balance sheet item related to the acquisition a pretax charge of 336 million 274 million after tax was recorded in the fourth quarter in respect of the burlington plant closure as part of the realignment plan responsibility for the us can plastic container business was transferred to the company’s plastic packaging americas segment effective january 1 2007 

also in 2006 a pretax charge of 14 million 09 million after tax was recorded to shut down a metal food can production line in the whitby ontario plant production from the line has ceased and other shut down activities are expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2007 

in 2005 the company recorded a pretax charge of 112 million 75 million after tax related to a work force reduction in the burlington plant and to close a food can plant in quebec the quebec plant was closed and ceased operations in the third quarter of 2005 and the land and building were sold 

competitors in the metal food container product line include two national and a small number of regional suppliers and self manufacturers several producers in mexico also manufacture steel food containers competition in the us steel aerosol can market primarily includes two national suppliers steel containers also compete with other packaging materials in the food and household products industry including glass aluminum plastic paper and the standup pouch as a result demand for this product line is dependent on product innovation and cost reduction service quality and price are among the key competitive factors 

plastic packaging americas 

plastic packaging americas accounted for 10 percent of ball’s consolidated net sales in 2006 demand for containers made of pet and polypropylene has increased in the beverage and food markets with improved barrier technologies and other advances this growth in demand is expected to continue while pet and polypropylene beverage containers compete against metal glass and cardboard the historical increase in the sales of pet containers has come primarily at the expense of glass containers and through new market introductions we estimate our 2006 shipments of more than 57 billion plastic containers to be approximately 9 percent of total us and canadian pet container shipments in addition this segment produced more than 640 million food and specialty containers during 2006 as a result of the alcan packaging alcan acquisition discussed below the company operates seven plastic container manufacturing facilities in the us and one in canada 

on march 28 2006 ball corporation acquired certain north american plastic container net assets from alcan packaging for a total cash consideration of 185 million ball acquired plastic container manufacturing plants in batavia illinois bellevue ohio and brampton ontario as well as certain equipment and other assets at an alcan research facility in neenah wisconsin and at a plant in newark california subsequent to the acquisition the rd activities were relocated from neenah to the btic in westminster colorado and plastic bottle production at the newark california plant was terminated the costs of these activities were treated as opening balance sheet items the acquired business primarily manufactures and sells barrier polypropylene plastic bottles used in food packaging and to a lesser extent manufactures and sells barrier pet plastic bottles used for beverages and foods the acquired business employs approximately 470 people and has annual sales of approximately 150 million the acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and accordingly its results have been included in our consolidated financial statements in the plastic packaging americas segment from march 28 2006

competition in the pet plastic container industry includes several national and regional suppliers and self manufacturers while ball is one of three major competitors in the polypropylene container industry service quality and price are important competitive factors the ability to produce customized differentiated plastic containers is also a key competitive factor 

most of ball’s pet containers are sold under longterm contracts to suppliers of bottled water and carbonated soft drinks including bottlers of pepsicola branded beverages and their affiliates that utilize consolidated purchasing groups most of our polypropylene containers are also sold under longterm contracts primarily to food packaging companies plastic beer containers are being produced for several of our customers and we are manufacturing plastic containers for the single serve juice and wine markets our line of heattektm pet plastic bottles for hotfilled beverages such as sports drinks and juices includes sizes from 8 ounces to 64 ounces 

metal beverage packaging europeasia 

the metal beverage packaging europeasia segment which accounted for 23 percent of ball’s consolidated net sales in 2006 consists of 10 beverage can plants and two beverage can end plants in europe as well as operations in the people’s republic of china prc of the 12 european plants four are located in germany three in the united kingdom two in france and one each in the netherlands poland and serbia the european plants produced approximately 13 billion cans in 2006 with approximately 60 percent of those being produced from aluminum and 40 percent from steel six of the can plants use aluminum and four use steel 

ball packaging europe is the second largest metal beverage container producer in europe with an estimated 29 percent of european shipments and produces twopiece beverage cans and can ends for producers of beer carbonated soft drinks mineral water fruit juices energy drinks and other beverages ball packaging europe is the largest metal beverage container manufacturer in germany france and the benelux countries and the second largest metal beverage container manufacturer in the united kingdom and poland in 2005 ball completed the construction of an aluminum beverage can manufacturing plant in belgrade serbia to serve the growing demand for beverage cans in southern and eastern europe 

on april 1 2006 a fire in the company’s hassloch germany plant damaged the majority of the plant’s building and machinery and equipment property insurance proceeds will largely cover equipment replacement cost and cleanup costs and business interruption insurance proceeds generally cover lost volumes and other costs in june 2006 the company announced its intention to rebuild the hassloch plant with two steel lines and to add an aluminum line in its hermsdorf germany plant to replace the lost volume all three lines are expected to be operational during the second quarter of 2007 

as in north america the metal beverage container competes aggressively with other packaging materials used by the european beer and carbonated soft drink industries the glass bottle is heavily utilized in the packaged beer industry while the pet container is increasingly utilized in the carbonated soft drink juice and mineral water industries 

the european beverage can business is capital intensive requiring significant investments in machinery and equipment profitability is sensitive to selling prices foreign exchange rates transportation costs production volumes labor and the costs and availability of certain raw materials such as aluminum and steel the european aluminum and steel industries are highly consolidated with three steel suppliers and three aluminum suppliers providing 95 percent of european requirements raw material supply contracts are generally for a period of one year although ball packaging europe has negotiated some longer term agreements aluminum is purchased primarily in us dollars while the functional currencies of ball packaging europe and its subsidiaries are nonus dollars this inherently results in a foreign exchange rate risk which the company minimizes through the use of derivative contracts in addition purchase and sales contracts include fixed price floating and passthrough pricing arrangements 

page 4 of 98 

rd efforts in europe are directed toward the development of new sizes and types of metal containers as well as new uses for the current containers other research and development objectives in this segment include improving manufacturing efficiencies the european rd activities are conducted in a technical center located in bonn germany 

through ball asia pacific limited we are one of the largest beverage can manufacturers in the prc and believe that our facilities are among the most modern in that country capacity grew rapidly in the prc in the late 1990s resulting in a supplydemand imbalance to which we responded by rationalizing capacity demand growth has resumed and projected annual growth is expected to be in the 5 to 10 percent range in the near term ball is undertaking selected capacity increases in its existing facilities in order to participate in the projected growth our operations include the manufacture of aluminum cans and ends in three plants in the prc located in the north central and south regions we also manufacture and sell highdensity plastic containers in two prc plants in addition we participate in two joint ventures that manufacture aluminum cans and ends in the prc 

in the fourth quarter of 2006 we acquired the minority interest ownership in the highdensity plastic hdp container business for 46 million in cash and signed a longterm supply contract with the former minority owner this business operates two hdp container plants in the prc

aerospace and technologies 

the aerospace and technologies segment which accounted for 10 percent of consolidated net sales in 2006 includes national defense solutions advanced technologies and products civil space systems and operational space businesses the segment develops spacecraft sensors and instruments radio frequency systems and other advanced technologies for the civil commercial and national security aerospace markets 

the majority of the aerospace and technologies business involves work under contracts generally from one to five years in duration as a prime contractor or subcontractor for the national aeronautics and space administration nasa the us department of defense dod and other us government agencies contracts funded by the various agencies of the federal government represented 90 percent of segment sales in 2006 geopolitical events and executive and legislative branch priorities have yielded considerable growth opportunities in areas matching our core capabilities however there is strong competition for new business 

the civil space systems defense solutions and operational space businesses include hardware software and services sold primarily to us customers with emphasis on space science and exploration environmental and earth sciences and defense and intelligence applications major contractual activities frequently involve the design manufacture and testing of satellites remote sensors and ground station control hardware and software as well as related services such as launch vehicle integration and satellite operations 

other hardware activities include target identification warning and attitude control systems and components cryogenic systems for reactant storage and sensor cooling devices using either closedcycle mechanical refrigerators or opencycle solid and liquid cryogens star trackers which are generalpurpose stellar attitude sensors and faststeering mirrors additionally the aerospace and technologies segment provides diversified technical services and products to government agencies prime contractors and commercial organizations for a broad range of information warfare electronic warfare avionics intelligence training and space systems needs 

backlog in the aerospace and technologies segment was 886 million and 761 million at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively and consists of the aggregate contract value of firm orders excluding amounts previously recognized as revenue the 2006 backlog includes 528 million expected to be recognized in revenues during 2007 with the remainder expected to be recognized in revenues thereafter unfunded amounts included in backlog for certain firm government orders which are subject to annual funding were 492 million and 500 million at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively yeartoyear comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations 

page 5 of 98 

the company’s aerospace and technologies segment has contracts with the us government or its contractors which have standard termination provisions the government retains the right to terminate contracts at its convenience however if contracts are terminated in this manner ball is entitled to reimbursement for allowable costs and profits on authorized work performed through the date of termination us government contracts are also subject to reduction or modification in the event of changes in government requirements or budgetary constraints 

patents 

in the opinion of the company none of its active patents is essential to the successful operation of its business as a whole 

research and development 

note 19 research and development in the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report contains information on company research and development activity additional information is also included in item 2 “properties” 

environment 

aluminum steel and plastic containers are recyclable and significant amounts of used containers are being diverted from the solid waste stream and recycled using the most recent data available in 2005 approximately 52 percent of aluminum containers 63 percent of steel containers and 23 percent of the pet containers sold in the us were recycled recycling rates vary throughout europe but generally average 60 percent for aluminum and steel containers which exceeds the european union’s goal of 50 percent recycling for metals due in part to the intrinsic value of aluminum and steel metal packaging recycling rates in the us and europe compare favorably to those of other packaging materials 

compliance with federal state and local laws relating to protection of the environment has not had a material adverse effect upon the capital expenditures earnings or competitive position of the company as more fully described under item 3 “legal proceedings” the us environmental protection agency and various state environmental agencies have designated the company as a potentially responsible party along with numerous other companies for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites however the company’s information at this time indicates that these matters will not have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity results of operations or financial condition of the company 

legislation which would prohibit tax or restrict the sale or use of certain types of containers and would require diversion of solid wastes such as packaging materials from disposal in landfills has been or may be introduced anywhere we operate while container legislation has been adopted in some jurisdictions similar legislation has been defeated in public referenda and legislative bodies in numerous others the company anticipates that continuing efforts will be made to consider and adopt such legislation in many jurisdictions in the future if such legislation were widely adopted it potentially could have a material adverse effect on the business of the company including its liquidity results of operations or financial condition this legislation could also have a material adverse effect on the container manufacturing industry generally in view of the company’s substantial global sales and investment in metal and pet container manufacturing however the packages we produce are widely used and perform well in most jurisdictions that have deposit systems 

employees 

at the end of december 2006 the company employed approximately 15500 people worldwide including 11200 employees in the us and 4300 in other countries there are an additional 1000 people employed in unconsolidated joint ventures in which ball participates approximately onethird of balls north american packaging plant employees are unionized and most of our european plant employees are union workers collective bargaining agreements with various unions in the us have terms of three to five years and those in europe have terms of one to two years the agreements expire at regular intervals and are customarily renewed in the ordinary course after bargaining between union and company representatives the company believes that its employee relations are good and that its training education and retention practices assist in enhancing employee satisfaction levels

 item 1a risk factors 

any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

there can be no assurance that the us can and alcan businesses or any acquisition will be successfully integrated into the acquiring company see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report for details of the acquisitions 

while we have what we believe to be well designed integration plans if we cannot successfully integrate us can’s and alcan’s operations with those of ball we may experience material negative consequences to our business financial condition or results of operations the integration of companies that have previously been operated separately involves a number of risks including but not limited to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prior to the acquisitions ball us can and alcan operated as separate businesses we may not be able to achieve potential synergies or maintain the levels of revenue earnings or operating efficiency that each business had achieved or might achieve separately the successful integration of us can’s and alcan’s operations will depend on our ability to manage those operations realize opportunities for revenue growth presented by strengthened product offerings and to some degree to eliminate redundant and excess costs 

page 7 of 98 

the loss of a key customer could have a significant negative impact on our sales 

while we have diversified our customer base we do sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major beverage packaged food and household product companies which operate in north america south america europe and asia 

although approximately 70 percent of our customer contracts are longterm these contracts are terminable under certain circumstances such as our failure to meet quality or volume requirements because we depend on relatively few major customers our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss of any of these customers a reduction in the purchasing levels of these customers a strike or work stoppage by a significant number of these customers employees or an adverse change in the terms of the supply agreements with these customers 

the primary customers for our aerospace segment are us government agencies or their prime contractors these sales represented approximately 9 percent of balls consolidated 2006 net sales our contracts with these customers are subject to among other things the following risks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we face competitive risks from many sources that may negatively impact our profitability 

competition within the packaging industry is intense increases in productivity combined with surplus capacity in the industry have maintained competitive pricing pressures the principal methods of competition in the general packaging industry are price service and quality some of our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources our current or potential competitors may offer products at a lower price or products that are deemed superior to ours 

we are subject to competition from alternative products which could result in lower profits and reduced cash flows 

our packaging products are subject to significant competition from substitute products particularly plastic carbonated soft drink bottles made from pet single serve beer bottles and containers made of glass cardboard or other materials competition from plastic carbonated soft drink bottles is particularly intense in the united states and the united kingdom there can be no assurance that our products will successfully compete against alternative products which could result in a reduction in our profits or cash flow 

we have a narrow product range and our business would suffer if usage of our products decreased 

for the 12 months ended december 31 2006 62 percent of our consolidated net sales were from the sale of metal beverage cans and we expect to derive a significant portion of our future revenues from the sale of metal beverage cans we sell no pet bottles in europe our business would suffer if the use of metal beverage cans decreased accordingly broad acceptance by consumers of aluminum and steel cans for a wide variety of beverages is critical to our future success if demand for glass and pet bottles increases relative to cans or the demand for aluminum and steel cans does not develop as expected our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

page 8 of 98 

our business financial condition and results of operations are subject to risks resulting from increased international operations 

we derived 23 percent of our consolidated net sales from outside of north and south america in the year ended december 31 2006 this sizeable scope of international operations may lead to more volatile financial results and make it more difficult for us to manage our business reasons for this include but are not limited to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any of these factors could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations 

for the 12 months ended december 31 2006 77 percent of our consolidated net sales were attributable to operations with the us dollar as their functional currency 11 percent with the euro as the functional currency and 12 percent were attributable to operations having functional currencies other than the us dollar or the euro 

our reporting currency is the us dollar historically balls foreign operations including assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses have been denominated in various currencies other than the us dollar and we expect that our foreign operations will continue to be so denominated as a result the us dollar value of balls foreign operations has varied and will continue to vary with exchange rate fluctuations ball has been and is presently primarily exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate of the euro british pound canadian dollar polish zloty chinese renminbi brazilian real argentine peso and serbian dinar 

a decrease in the value of any of these currencies especially the euro and the british pound relative to the us dollar could reduce our profits from foreign operations and the value of the net assets of our foreign operations when reported in us dollars in our financial statements this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations as reported in us dollars 

in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to currencies in which the earnings are generated may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations for purposes of accounting the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations where the local currency is the functional currency are translated using periodend exchange rates and the revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are translated using average exchange rates during each period translation gains and losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of shareholders equity 

we actively manage our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations particularly our exposure to fluctuations in the euro to us dollar exchange rate in order to mitigate the effect of foreign cash flow and reduce earnings volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes we primarily use forward contracts and options to manage our foreign currency exposures and as a result we experience gains and losses on these derivative positions offset in part by the impact of currency fluctuations on existing assets and liabilities our inability to properly manage our exposure to currency fluctuations could materially impact our results 

our business operating results and financial condition are subject to particular risks in certain regions of the world 

we may experience an operating loss in one or more regions of the world for one or more periods which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition moreover overcapacity which often leads to lower prices exists in a number of regions including north america south america and asia and may persist even if demand grows our ability to manage such operational fluctuations and to maintain adequate longterm strategies in the face of such developments will be critical to our continued growth and profitability 

page 9 of 98 

if we fail to retain key management and personnel we may be unable to implement our key objectives 

we believe that our future success depends in part on our experienced management team losing the services of key members of our management team could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet our objectives 

decreases in our ability to apply new technology and knowhow may affect our competitiveness 

our success depends in part on our ability to improve production processes and services we must also introduce new products and services to meet changing customer needs if we are unable to implement better production processes or to develop new products we may not be able to remain competitive with other manufacturers as a result our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

bad weather and climate changes may result in lower sales 

we manufacture packaging products primarily for beverages and foods unseasonably cool weather can reduce demand for certain beverages packaged in our containers in addition poor weather conditions or changes in climate that reduce crop yields of fruits and vegetables can adversely affect demand for our food containers creating potentially adverse effects on our business natural or other catastrophes such as earthquakes hurricanes fires and floods could significantly damage or destroy one or more of our facilities as well as those of our suppliers and customers which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we are vulnerable to fluctuations in the supply and price of raw materials 

we purchase aluminum steel plastic resin and other raw materials and packaging supplies from several sources while all such materials are available from independent suppliers raw materials are subject to fluctuations in price attributable to a number of factors including general economic conditions commodity price fluctuations particularly aluminum on the london metal exchange the demand by other industries for the same raw materials and the availability of complementary and substitute materials although we enter into commodities purchase agreements from time to time and use derivative instruments to hedge our risk we cannot ensure that our current suppliers of raw materials will be able to supply us with sufficient quantities or at reasonable prices increases in raw material costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations because our north american contracts often pass raw material costs directly on to the customer increasing raw materials costs may not impact our nearterm profitability but could decrease our sales volume over time in europe our contracts do not typically allow us to pass on increased raw material costs and we regularly use derivative agreements to manage this risk our hedging procedures may be insufficient and our results could be materially impacted if materials costs increase 

prolonged work stoppages at plants with union employees could jeopardize our financial position 

as of december 31 2006 approximately a third of our employees in north america and most of our employees in europe were covered by one or more collective bargaining agreements these collective bargaining agreements have staggered expirations during the next three years although we consider our employee relations to be generally good a prolonged work stoppage or strike at any facility with union employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition we cannot assure you that upon the expiration of existing collective bargaining agreements new agreements will be reached without union action or that any such new agreements will be on terms satisfactory to us 

our business is subject to substantial environmental remediation and compliance costs 

our operations are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental hazards such as emissions to air discharges to water the handling and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes and the cleanup of hazardous substances the us environmental protection agency has designated us along with numerous other companies as a potentially responsible party for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites based on available information we do not believe that any costs incurred in connection with such sites will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations capital expenditures or competitive position 

page 10 of 98 

if we were required to write down all or part of our goodwill our net earnings and net worth could be materially adversely affected 

we have 17737 million of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2006 we are required to periodically determine if our goodwill has become impaired in which case we would write down the impaired portion of our goodwill if we were required to write down all or a significant part of our goodwill our net earnings and net worth could be materially adversely affected 

if the investments in balls pension plans do not perform as expected we may have to contribute additional amounts to the plans which would otherwise be available to cover operating expenses 

ball maintains noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of its us employees which we fund based on certain actuarial assumptions the plans assets consist primarily of common stocks and fixed income securities if the investments in the plans do not perform at expected levels we will have to contribute additional funds to ensure that the plans will be able to pay out benefits as scheduled such an increase in funding could result in a decrease in our available cash flow and net earnings and the recognition of such an increase could result in a reduction to our shareholders equity 

our significant debt could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the notes issued pursuant to our bond indentures 

we have a significant amount of debt on december 31 2006 we had total debt of 24517 million our ratio of earnings to fixed charges as of that date was 36 times see exhibit 12 attached to this annual report our relatively high level of debt could have important consequences including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition a substantial portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates if market interest rates increase variablerate debt will create higher debt service requirements which would adversely affect our cash flow while we sometimes enter into agreements limiting our exposure any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

management’s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes ball corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as “ball” or “the company” or “we” or “our” in the following discussion and analysis 

business overview 

ball corporation is one of the world’s leading suppliers of metal and plastic packaging to the beverage food and household products industries our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses and are manufactured in plants around the world we also supply aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers 

we sell our packaging products primarily to major beverage and food companies and producers of household products with which we have developed longterm customer relationships this is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of longterm supply contracts while we have diversified our customer base we do sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major companies in north america europe the people’s republic of china prc and argentina as do our equity joint ventures in brazil the us and the prc we also purchase raw materials from relatively few suppliers because of our customer and supplier concentration our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss of a major customer or supplier or a change in a supply agreement with a major customer or supplier although our longterm relationships and contracts mitigate these risks 

in the rigid packaging industry sales and earnings can be improved by reducing costs developing new products volume expansion and increasing pricing in 2008 we expect to complete a project to upgrade and streamline our north american beverage can end manufacturing capabilities a project that is expected to result in productivity gains and cost reductions beginning in 2007 while the us and canadian beverage container manufacturing industry is relatively mature the european prc and brazilian beverage can markets are growing and are expected to continue to grow we are capitalizing on this growth by continuing to reconfigure some of our european can manufacturing lines and by having constructed a new beverage can manufacturing plant in belgrade serbia in 2005 to better position the company in the european market the capacity from the firedamaged hassloch germany plant will be replaced with a mix of steel beverage can manufacturing capacity in the hassloch plant and aluminum beverage can manufacturing capacity in the company’s hermsdorf germany plant 

as part of our packaging strategy we are focused on developing and marketing new and existing products that meet the needs of our customers these innovations include new shapes sizes opening features and other functional benefits of both metal and plastic packaging this packaging development activity helps us maintain and expand our supply positions with major beverage food and household products customers 

ball’s consolidated earnings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations we attempt to mitigate this exposure through the use of derivative financial instruments as discussed in “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” within item 7a of this report 

the primary customers for the products and services provided by our aerospace and technologies segment are us government agencies or their prime contractors it is possible that federal budget reductions and priorities or changes in agency budgets could limit future funding and new contract awards or delay or prolong contract performance  

we recognize sales under longterm contracts in the aerospace and technologies segment using the costtocost percentage of completion method of accounting our present contract mix consists of approximately twothirds costtype contracts which are billed at our costs plus an agreed upon andor earned profit component and approximately onethird fixed price contracts we include time and material contracts in the fixed price category because such contracts typically provide for the sale of engineering labor at fixed hourly rates 

page 21 of 98 

throughout the period of contract performance we regularly reevaluate and if necessary revise our estimates of total contract revenue total contract cost and progress toward completion because of contract payment schedules limitations on funding and other contract terms our sales and accounts receivable for this segment include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed 

management uses various measures to evaluate company performance the primary financial metric we use is economic valued added operating earnings as defined by the company less a charge for net operating assets employed our goal is to increase economic valued added on an annual basis other financial metrics we use are earnings before interest and taxes ebit earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda diluted earnings per share operating cash flow and free cash flow generally defined by the company as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures these financial measures may be adjusted at times for items that affect comparability between periods nonfinancial measures in the packaging segments include production spoilage rates quality control figures safety statistics and production and shipment volumes additional measures used to evaluate performance in the aerospace and technologies segment include contract revenue realization award and incentive fees realized proposal win rates and backlog including awarded contracted and funded backlog 

we recognize that attracting and retaining quality employees is essential to the success of ball and because of this we strive to pay employees competitively and encourage their ownership of the company’s common stock as part of a diversified portfolio for most management employees a meaningful portion of compensation is at risk as an incentive dependent upon economic value added operating performance for more senior positions more compensation is at risk through our employee stock purchase plan and 401k plan which matches employee contributions with ball common stock employees regardless of organizational level have opportunities to own ball shares 

recent developments 

on march 27 2006 ball acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of us can corporation us can for consideration of 444756 common shares of ball corporation valued at 4428 per share for a total of 197 million in connection with the acquisition ball refinanced 5982 million of us can debt including 268 million of bond redemption premiums and fees and over the next several years expects to realize approximately 42 million for acquired net operating tax loss carryforwards as a result of this acquisition ball became the largest manufacturer of aerosol cans in north america and now manufactures aerosol cans paint cans plastic containers and custom and specialty cans in 10 plants in the us and aerosol cans in two plants in argentina in october 2006 the company announced it would close an acquired plant in alliance ohio the acquired operations have annual sales of approximately 600 million the acquired business forms part of ball’s metal food and household products packaging americas segment and its results have been included since the date of acquisition effective january 1 2007 responsibility for the us can plastics business was transferred to our plastic packaging americas segment 

on march 28 2006 ball acquired north american plastic bottle container assets from alcan packaging alcan for 1847 million cash this acquisition strengthens the company’s plastic container business and complements its food container business the acquired assets included two plastic container manufacturing plants in the us and one in canada as well as certain manufacturing equipment and other assets from other alcan facilities the acquired business primarily manufactures and sells barrier polypropylene plastic bottles used in food packaging and to a lesser extent barrier pet plastic bottles used for beverages and food the acquired operations have annual sales of approximately 150 million the operations form part of ball’s plastic packaging americas segment and their results have been included since the date of acquisition 

the company refinanced us can’s debt at the time of the acquisition with significantly lower interest rates through the issuance by ball corporation of 450 million of new senior notes and a 500 million increase in bank debt under the senior credit facilities put in place in the fourth quarter of 2005 the proceeds of these financings were also used to acquire the alcan operations and to reduce seasonal working capital debt   

 

on april 1 2006 a fire in the metal beverage can plant in hassloch germany damaged the majority of the building and machinery and equipment in november 2006 the company reached final agreement with the insurance carrier on property insurance and business interruption recoveries additional details are available in the “consolidated sales and earnings” section for the “metal beverage packaging europeasia” segment 

page 22 of 98 

in june 2006 the company’s us defined benefit plans for salaried employees were amended to provide more flexibility for future pension benefits by allowing portability and changing the benefit to a career average pay scheme that grows by a prescribed amount annually the annual accounting expense under the amended plans will be lower and more predictable the amendments which were effective january 1 2007 reduced 2006 pension expense by approximately 7 million we intend to reduce our current return on asset assumption for the us pension plans to 825 percent for 2007 based upon current market conditions and anticipated longterm rate of return on plan assets while increasing the discount rate assumption to 6 percent based on these assumptions and the 2006 salaried plan design changes us pension expense for 2007 is anticipated to increase 4 million compared to 2006 most of which will be included in cost of sales pension expense in europe and canada combined is expected to be slightly higher than the 2006 expense a reduction of the plan asset return assumption by one quarter of a percentage point would result in additional expense of approximately 22 million while a quarter of a percentage point reduction in the discount rate would result in approximately 19 million of additional expense additional information regarding the company’s pension plans is provided in note 14 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report 

consolidated sales and earnings 

the company has five reportable segments organized along a combination of product lines and geographic areas 1 metal beverage packaging americas 2 metal beverage packaging europeasia 3 metal food and household products packaging americas 4 plastic packaging americas and 5 aerospace and technologies we also have investments in companies in the us the prc and brazil which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and accordingly those results are not included in segment sales or earnings we expect a strong first quarter in 2007 as elevated raw material inventories are reduced to more normal levels 

during the fourth quarter of 2006 ball’s management changed its method of inventory accounting for certain invnetories from the lastin firstout lifo method to the firstin firstout fifo method in the metal beverage americas and the metal food and household products packaging americas segments all periods presented have been retrospectively adjusted on a fifo basis in the third quarter of 2006 the company changed its expense allocation method by allocating to each of the packaging segments stockbased compensation expense previously included in corporate undistributed expenses the change did not have a significant impact on any segment for the current or prior years prior periods have been conformed to the current presentation of the segments and the change in expense allocation 

metal beverage packaging americas 

the metal beverage packaging americas segment consists of operations located in the us canada and puerto rico which manufacture products used primarily in beverage packaging this segment accounted for 39 percent of consolidated net sales in 2006 42 percent in 2005 sales were 9 percent higher in 2006 than in 2005 due to more than 4 percent higher beverage can shipments coupled with higher aluminum prices passed through to our customers the increased sales over 2005 were also driven by favorable weather in many parts of the us and canada as well as the promotion of 12ounce can packages by beer and soft drink companies sales in 2005 were slightly higher than in 2004 as lower 2005 sales volumes were offset by the pass through of higher aluminum prices metal beverage container volumes in 2005 were 25 percent below the previous year’s levels as a result of poor weather in the first quarter temporary volume reductions and general softness in the beer and carbonated soft drink markets based on publicly available information we estimate that our shipments of metal beverage containers were approximately 32 percent of total us and canadian shipments in 2006 

we continue to focus efforts on the growing custom beverage can business which includes cans of different shapes diameters and fill volumes and cans with added functional attributes for new products and product line extensions during the first quarter of 2006 we completed the conversion of a line in our monticello indiana plant from 12ounce can manufacturing to a line capable of producing other sizes 

earnings in the segment were 2694 million in 2006 compared to 2348 million in 2005 and 2757 million in 2004 the third quarter of 2005 included a pretax charge of 193 million 117 million after tax related to a project to significantly upgrade and streamline our north american beverage can end manufacturing capabilities the charge included the write off of obsolete equipment spare parts and tooling as well as employee termination costs over time this capital project is expected to result in productivity improvements and reduced manufacturing 

page 23 of 98 

costs we have installed and are operating three of eight production modules in this multiyear project and the fourth and fifth modules are in the installation phase the project is expected to be completed in 2008 in connection with this project the can end manufacturing operations at the reidsville north carolina plant were shut down during the fourth quarter of 2006 

despite higher sales in 2006 segment earnings growth was constrained by product mix and continued yearoveryear cost growth particularly higher energy other direct material and freight costs which were 21 million more than in 2005 while contract price escalations have commenced for many of our customers cost growth has continued to outpace price increases energy freight and other direct material costs were 32 million higher in 2005 than in 2004 partially offset by efficiency gains cost controls and lower selling general and administrative costs in 2005 while pricing pressures continue on our raw materials other direct materials and freight and utility costs we continue to work with both customers and suppliers to maintain our volumes as well as preserve our margins 

metal beverage packaging europeasia 

the metal beverage packaging europeasia segment includes the production and sale of metal beverage container products manufactured and sold in europe and asia as well as plastic containers manufactured and sold in asia this segment accounted for 23 percent of consolidated net sales in 2006 24 percent in 2005 ball packaging europe which represents an estimated 29 percent of the total european metal beverage container manufacturing capacity has manufacturing plants located in germany the united kingdom france the netherlands poland and serbia 

due to strong demand segment can shipments were more than 9 percent higher in 2006 than in 2005 higher segment sales volumes were aided by favorable european weather and germany hosting the world cup soccer championship during june and july 2006 as well as by continued growth in the china market segment sales which grew 12 percent in 2006 also benefited from the strength of the euro segment sales were approximately 9 percent higher in 2005 than in 2004 primarily as a result of an increase in sales volumes 

the slow return of the can to the german market as a result of the mandatory deposit legislation previously reported on is being more than offset by stronger demand elsewhere in europe including southern and eastern europe we expect prc demand for aluminum beverage cans to grow in the coming years as both multinational and chinese beverage fillers expand their markets 

the construction of a new beverage can plant in belgrade serbia was completed near the end of the second quarter of 2005 to serve the growing demand for beverage cans in southern and eastern europe the plant became fully operational during the third quarter of 2005 the serbian plant was constructed to accommodate a second can production line and a can end manufacturing module for future growth 

earnings in the segment were 2687 million in 2006 1805 million in 2005 and 1951 million in 2004 segment earnings in 2006 included a 755 million property insurance gain related to a fire at the company’s hassloch germany metal beverage can plant further details are provided in the “recent developments” section the third quarter of 2006 also included a gain of 55 million related to the change in an estimated liability the fourth quarter of 2005 included a 93 million gain primarily resulting from the final settlement of all tax obligations related to liquidated china operations for amounts less than originally estimated first quarter 2005 segment earnings included a 34 million expense for the write off of the remaining carrying value of an equity investment in the prc earnings in 2004 included income of 137 million related to the realization of proceeds on assets in the prc being in excess of amounts previously estimated and costs of liquidation being less than anticipated in a prior year business consolidation charge 

segment earnings in 2006 were higher than in 2005 due to the property insurance gain higher volumes price recovery initiatives and effective manufacturing and selling general and administrative cost controls partially offset by higher raw material freight and energy costs and pricecost compression in the prc higher material energy and transportation costs as well as second and third quarter start up costs related to a line conversion in the netherlands and the new serbia plant had a negative effect on 2005 segment earnings compared to 2004 partially offsetting these higher costs were lower selling general and administrative costs 

page 24 of 98 

on april 1 2006 a fire in the metal beverage can plant in hassloch germany damaged the majority of the building machinery and equipment the property insurance proceeds recorded for the year ended december 31 2006 which are based on replacement cost were €863 million 1093 million of which €26 million 324 million was received in april 2006 €227 million 289 million was received in october 2006 and the remainder of €376 million 496 million which was recorded in other longterm assets was received in january 2007 a €267 million 338 million fixed asset write down was recorded to reflect the estimated impairment of the assets damaged as a result of the fire as a result a gain of €596 million 755 million pretax was recorded in the 2006 consolidated statement of earnings to reflect the difference between the net book value of the impaired assets and the property insurance proceeds an additional €15 million 19 million €13 million 165 million and €12 million 155 million were recorded in cost of sales in the second third and fourth quarters respectively for insurance recoveries related to business interruption costs as well as €113 million 143 million to offset cleanup costs an additional €27 million of business interruption recoveries has been agreed upon with the insurance carrier and will be recognized in 2007 

in june 2006 the company announced its intention to rebuild the hassloch plant with two steel lines and to add an aluminum line in its hermsdorf germany plant all three lines are expected to be operational during the second quarter of 2007 

in the fourth quarter of 2006 we acquired the minority interest in our two prc highdensity plastic joint ventures for 46 million in cash during the fourth quarter of 2004 sanshui jianlibao ftb packaging limited sanshui jfp a 35 percent owned prc joint venture experienced a greater than customary seasonal production slowdown caused by cash flow difficulties in response we recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts in respect of sanshui jfp’s receivable from the joint venture partner for 152 million which was included in the 2004 consolidated statement of earnings as equity in results of affiliates information learned late in the first quarter of 2005 led the company to record expense of 34 million to write off the remaining carrying value of this investment 

earnings of 93 million and 137 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively were recognized as prc restructuring activities that commenced in 2001 were completed resulting in realization on assets in excess of amounts previously estimated as well as costs incurred being less than estimated including settlement of tax matters all costs and transactions related to the prc restructuring have been concluded

segment earnings were 6 million in 2006 compared to 191 million in 2005 and 464 million in 2004 the fourth quarter of 2006 included a pretax charge of 338 million primarily for the closure of a metal food can manufacturing plant in burlington ontario as part of the realignment of the segment following the us can acquisition discussed in more detail below the first six months of 2006 included a net pretax charge of 17 million primarily related to the shut down of a metal food can manufacturing line in the whitby ontario plant 

page 25 of 98 

the fourth quarter of 2005 included a pretax charge of 46 million 31 million after tax for pension severance and other employee benefit costs related to a reduction in force in the burlington plant the second quarter of 2005 included a pretax charge of 88 million 59 million after tax for the closure of a threepiece food can manufacturing plant in quebec the quebec plant was closed and ceased operations in the third quarter of 2005 and an agreement was reached to sell the land and building which resulted in the second quarter charge being offset by a 22 million gain 15 million after tax in the fourth quarter of 2006 to adjust the plant to net realizable value 

higher sales volumes related to the us can acquisition helped improve segment earnings in the last nine months of 2006 despite the negative impact of lower food can volumes attributable to the loss of a customer in late 2005 and a poor salmon harvest in 2006 additionally segment earnings in 2006 were reduced by purchase accounting adjustments of 61 million which increased cost of sales due to inventory valuations associated with the acquired us can finished goods inventory contributing to lower segment earnings in 2005 compared to 2004 were higher freight costs from fuel surcharges and higher other direct material and utility costs energy freight and other direct material costs were 16 million higher in 2005 than in 2004 partially offset by efficiency gains cost controls and lower selling general and administrative costs in 2005 while pricing pressures continue on all of our raw materials other direct materials and freight and utility costs we continue to work with both customers and suppliers to maintain our volumes as well as to preserve our margins 

in october 2006 the company announced plans to close two manufacturing facilities in north america by the end of 2006 as part of the realignment of the metal food and household products packaging americas segment following the acquisition of us can earlier in the year the company closed a leased facility in alliance ohio which was one of 10 manufacturing locations acquired from us can and a plant in burlington ontario which was part of the metal food can operations prior to the us can acquisition a pretax charge of 338 million 275 million after tax was recorded in the fourth quarter primarily related to the burlington closure for employee termination and pension costs plant decommissioning costs and fixed asset impairment the closure of the ohio plant has been treated as an opening balance sheet item the estimated costs of the closures will be cash flow neutral after tax benefits and anticipated proceeds from the sale of fixed assets   the company continues to evaluate the segment’s manufacturing structure and expects to identify other opportunities to improve efficiencies

plastic packaging americas 

the plastic packaging americas segment consists of operations located in the us and canada which manufacture polyethylene terephthalate pet and polypropylene plastic container products used mainly in beverage and food packaging segment sales in 2006 comprised 10 percent of consolidated sales 8 percent in 2005 and increased 32 percent compared to 2005 due largely to the plant and other asset acquisitions from alcan and higher pet bottle volumes we continue to focus pet development efforts in the custom hotfill beer wine flavored alcoholic beverage and specialty container markets and we are adding specialty container production capacity to accommodate new demand in the food and specialty area development efforts are focused on custom markets as well 

the 22 percent sales increase in 2005 compared to 2004 was largely due to the pass through to our customers of higher resin prices as well as 75 percent higher sales volumes in 2005 compared to 2004 as a result of higher demand for barrier and heatset containers that provide longer shelflife for products combined with strong demand for plastic water bottles although only a small percentage of our total volume sales of juice sports drink and beer containers increased in 2006 these sales are expected to grow in the future as more focus is placed on such specialty markets and the development of our heattektm business we estimate our 2006 shipments of more than 57 billion pet plastic containers to be approximately 9 percent of total us and canadian pet container shipments in addition the plastic packaging americas segment produced more than 640 million food and specialty containers during 2006 

page 26 of 98 

segment earnings were 247 million in 2006 compared to 167 million in 2005 and 96 million in 2004 segment earnings in 2006 were higher than in 2005 largely due to the incremental sales from the alcan acquisition but were partially offset by energy cost increases of approximately 6 million the timing of resin cost increases and costs incurred for a litigation claim that was favorably resolved in july 2006 earnings in the second quarter of 2006 also included purchase accounting adjustments of 12 million which increased cost of sales due to the valuation of inventories associated with the acquired alcan finished goods inventory in 2007 the plastic packaging americas segment will include the sales and earnings of a plastic pail business which was recorded in the 2006 operating results of the metal food and household products packaging americas segment 

the improvement in earnings in 2005 over 2004 was the result of higher sales and production volumes and growth in specialty products partially offsetting these improvements in 2005 were higher utility costs segment earnings in 2004 were reduced by 13 million primarily related to costs associated with the relocation of the plastics offices and research and development facility from atlanta georgia to colorado earnings in 2004 were also negatively impacted by continued pricing pressures on plastic containers for carbonated soft drink and water customers 

aerospace and technologies 

aerospace and technologies segment sales represented 10 percent of 2006 consolidated net sales 12 percent in 2005 and were 3 percent lower than in 2005 sales in 2005 were 6 percent higher than in 2004 the lower 2006 sales were largely due to contracts being completed during the period as well as the impact of government funding reductions and program delays higher sales in 2005 compared to 2004 resulted from a combination of newly awarded contracts and additions to previously awarded contracts the aerospace and technologies business won a number of large strategic contracts and delivered a considerable amount of sophisticated space and defense instrumentation throughout the threeyear period 

segment earnings were 50 million in 2006 547 million in 2005 and 487 million in 2004 the first quarter of 2005 included expense of 38 million for the write down to net realizable value of an equity investment in an aerospace company this investment was sold in october 2005 for approximately its carrying value earnings in 2006 were negatively affected by the lower sales due to program delays and unfavorable contract mix the improvement in 2005 earnings compared to 2004 was primarily the result of higher sales and improved program performance 

some of the segment’s highprofile contracts include worldview 1 and worldview 2 advanced commercial remote sensing satellites the james webb space telescope a successor to the hubble space telescope the spacebased space surveillance system which will detect and track space objects such as satellites and orbital debris npoess the nextgeneration satellite weather monitoring system and a number of antennas for the joint strike fighter 

sales to the us government either directly as a prime contractor or indirectly as a subcontractor represented 90 percent of segment sales in 2006 87 percent in 2005 and 82 percent in 2004  contracted backlog for the aerospace and technologies segment at december 31 2006 and 2005 was 886 million and 761 million respectively yeartoyear comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative sga expenses were 2872 million 2338 million and 2688 million for 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the increase in sga expenses in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily the result of 20 million of incremental sga after realized synergies from the acquired us can operations a 58 million outofperiod adjustment discussed below higher expense of 63 million associated with the adoption of sfas no 123 revised 2004 2 million for higher rates associated with the company’s receivables sales agreement 5 million of increased legal fees related to patent litigation 67 million for an initial marktomarket adjustment to one of the company’s deferred compensation stock plans due to a plan amendment and normal compensation and benefit increases expenses in 2005 were lower than 2004 in all areas of the company due largely to lower employee compensation and benefit costs including the company’s deposit share program and economicvalueadded based incentive compensation plans these lower costs were partially offset by higher pension costs higher accounts receivable securitization fees and the write down of the prc and aerospace equity investments in the first quarter of 2005 

subsequent to the issuance of its financial statements for the year ended december 31 2005 the company determined that certain foreign currency exchange losses had been inadvertently deferred for the years 2005 2004 and 2003 since the amounts were not material individually or in the aggregate to any previously issued financial statements or to our full year results of operations for 2006 a cumulative 58 million outofperiod adjustment was included in sga expenses in the first quarter of 2006 

on october 26 2005 ball’s board of directors approved the accelerated vesting of the outofthemoney unvested nonqualified stock options granted in april 2005 the acceleration affected approximately 665000 options granted to approximately 290 employees at an exercise price of 3974 the accelerated vesting of these nonqualified options allowed the company to eliminate approximately 5 million of pretax expense approximately 3 million after tax combined for 2006 to 2009 

interest and taxes 

consolidated interest expense was 1344 million in 2006 1164 million including debt refinancing costs of 193 million in 2005 and 1037 million in 2004 the higher expense in 2006 was primarily due to the additional borrowings used to finance the acquisitions of us can and the alcan assets the lower expense in 2005 compared to 2004 was due to lower average borrowings and higher capitalized interest the debt refinancing costs in 2005 of 193 million were costs associated with the refinancing of the company’s senior credit facilities and the redemption in the last half of 2005 of the company’s 775 senior notes which were due in august 2006 

ball’s consolidated effective income tax rate for 2006 was 294 percent compared to 292 percent in 2005 and 322 percent in 2004 while the effective tax rates for 2006 and 2005 are similar the 2006 rate was impacted by a onetime tax benefit of 81 million associated with a foreign exchange loss as a result of the change in the functional currency of a european subsidiary in the local statutory accounts the onetime benefit was somewhat offset by a higher foreign tax rate differential due to taxation of the german property insurance gain at the marginal rate of 39 and a valuation allowance on a canadian net operating loss resulting from the 2006 business consolidation costs the 2005 rate was impacted by the tax benefit recorded on the repatriation of foreign earnings see further discussion below plus the tax benefit on business consolidation costs applied at the higher marginal rate 

the decrease in the 2005 effective tax rate compared to 2004 is primarily due to the net tax benefit recorded on the repatriation of foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act of 2004 jobs act the tax benefit on business consolidation costs applied at the marginal tax rate increased research and development tax credits and the manufacturing deduction effective in 2005 under the jobs act further details of the amounts repatriated under the jobs act are available in note 13 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report these benefits were somewhat offset by the fact that no tax benefit was provided in respect of the equity investment write downs in the first quarter of 2005 the 38 million write down of the aerospace investment is not tax deductible while the realization of tax deductibility of the 34 million prc write down which will be a capital loss is not reasonably assured as the company does not have nor does it anticipate any capital gains to offset the capital losses 

page 28 of 98 

in connection with the internal revenue service’s irs examination of ball’s consolidated income tax returns for the tax years 2000 through 2004 the irs has proposed to disallow ball’s deductions of interest expense incurred on loans under a companyowned life insurance plan that has been in place for more than 20 years ball believes that its interest deductions will be sustained as filed and therefore no provision for loss has been recorded the total potential liability for the audit years 1999 through 2004 unaudited year 2005 and an estimate of the impact on 2006 is approximately 31 million excluding related interest the irs has withdrawn its proposed adjustments for any penalties see note 13 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report 

results of equity affiliates 

equity in the earnings of affiliates in 2006 is primarily attributable to our 50 percent ownership in packaging investments in the us and brazil earnings in 2004 included the results of a minorityowned aerospace business which was sold in october 2005 and a 152 million loss representing ball’s share of a provision for doubtful accounts relating to its 35 percent interest in sanshui jfp discussed above in “metal beverage packaging europeasia” after consideration of the prc loss earnings were 147 million in 2006 compared to 155 million in 2005 and 158 million in 2004

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows and capital expenditures 

cash flows from operating activities were 4014 million in 2006 compared to 5588 million in 2005 and 5359 million in 2004 

management internally uses a free cash flow measure 1 to evaluate the company’s operating results 2 for planning purposes 3 to evaluate strategic investments and 4 to evaluate the company’s ability to incur and service debt free cash flow is not a defined term under us generally accepted accounting principles and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures the company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less additions to property plant and equipment capital spending free cash flow is typically derived directly from the company’s cash flow statements however it may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods an example of such an item included in 2006 is the property insurance proceeds for the replacement of the firedamaged assets in our hassloch germany plant which is included in capital spending amounts 

based on this our consolidated free cash flow is summarized as follows 

 

 

cash flows from operating activities in 2006 were negatively affected by higher cash pension funding and higher working capital levels compared to the prior year the higher working capital was a combination of higher than planned raw material inventory levels higher income tax payments and higher accounts receivable balances the latter resulting primarily from the repayment of a portion of the accounts receivable securitization program and late payments from customers in europe management expects the increase in working capital to be temporary and that working capital levels will return to normal levels by the end of the first half of 2007 

page 29 of 98 

cash flow in 2005 compared to 2004 was negatively impacted by higher cash taxes this resulted in a decrease in deferred income taxes payable of 516 million in 2005 compared to an estimated increase in deferred taxes of 47 million in 2004 the primary causes of the increase in current income taxes and decrease in deferred income taxes were the reduction in 2005 of taxdeductible pension costs versus 2004 the impact in 2005 of the repatriation of foreign earnings and a reduction of tax versus book depreciation expense as tax depreciation was accelerated in prior years primarily due to bonus tax depreciation permitted in the tax laws after september 11 2001 cash flows from operating activities were positively affected in 2005 by lower accounts receivable higher accounts payable and lower pension contributions 

based on information currently available we estimate cash flows from operating activities for 2007 to be approximately 600 million capital spending net of property insurance recoveries to be approximately 250 million and free cash flow to be in the 350 million range capital spending of 2183 million net of 613 million in insurance recoveries in 2006 was below depreciation and amortization expense of 2526 million we continue to invest capital in our best performing operations including projects to increase custom can capabilities improve beverage can end making productivity and convert lines from steel to aluminum in europe as well as expenditures in the aerospace and technologies segment 

debt facilities and refinancing 

interestbearing debt at december 31 2006 increased 862 million to 24517 million from 15897 million at december 31 2005 this increase includes the issuance by ball corporation in march 2006 of 450 million of 6625 senior notes due in 2018 and a 500 million increase in bank debt under ball corporation’s senior credit facilities put in place in the fourth quarter of 2005 the proceeds from these financings were used to refinance existing us can debt at lower interest rates acquire certain net assets of alcan and reduce seasonal working capital debt other than acquisition related debt the 2006 debt increase from 2005 was primarily attributed to changes in foreign exchange rates 

at december 31 2006 675 million was available under the company’s multicurrency revolving credit facilities the company also had 329 million of shortterm uncommitted credit facilities available at the end of the year of which 1401 million was outstanding 

on october 13 2005 ball refinanced its senior secured credit facilities and during the third and fourth quarters of 2005 ball redeemed its 775 senior notes due august 2006 primarily through the drawdown of funds under the new credit facilities the refinancing and redemption resulted in a pretax debt refinancing charge of 193 million 123 million after tax to reflect the call premium associated with the senior notes and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs 

during the first quarter of 2004 ball repaid €31 million 38 million of its previous euro denominated term loan b and reduced the interest rate by 50 basis points during the fourth quarter of 2003 ball repaid 160 million of its previous us dollar denominated term loan b and €25 million of its previous euro denominated term loan b at the time of the early repayment the interest rate on the us portion of the term loan b was reduced by 50 basis points interest expense during the first quarter of 2004 included 05 million for the write off of the unamortized financing costs associated with the repaid loans 

the company has a receivables sales agreement that provides for the ongoing revolving sale of a designated pool of trade accounts receivable of ball’s north american packaging operations up to 225 million the agreement qualifies as offbalance sheet financing under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 140 as amended by sfas no 156 net funds received from the sale of the accounts receivable totaled 2013 million and 210 million at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively and are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets 

the company was not in default of any loan agreement at december 31 2006 and has met all payment obligations the us note agreements bank credit agreement and industrial development revenue bond agreements contain certain restrictions relating to dividends investments financial ratios guarantees and the incurrence of additional indebtedness

c   the company’s purchase obligations include contracted amounts for aluminum steel plastic resin and other direct materials also included are commitments for purchases of natural gas and electricity aerospace and technologies contracts and other less significant items in cases where variable prices andor usage are involved management’s best estimates have been used depending on the circumstances early termination of the contracts may not result in penalties and therefore actual payments could vary significantly 

contributions to the company’s defined benefit pension plans not including the unfunded german plans are expected to be 691 million in 2007 this estimate may change based on plan asset performance benefit payments related to these plans are expected to be 626 million 651 million 689 million 739 million and 751 million for the years ending december 31 2007 through 2011 respectively and 4367 million combined for 2012 through 2016 payments to participants in the unfunded german plans are expected to be 246 million 251 million 255 million 259 million and 261 million in the years 2007 through 2011 respectively and a total of 1366 million thereafter 

we reduced our share repurchase program in 2006 to 457 million net of issuances compared to 3581 million net repurchases in 2005 and 50 million in 2004 the net repurchases in 2006 did not include a forward contract entered into in december 2006 for the repurchase of 1200000 shares the contract was settled on january 5 2007 for 519 million in cash in 2007 we expect to repurchase approximately 175 million net of issuances and to reduce debt levels by more than 125 million annual cash dividends paid on common stock were 40 cents per share in 2006 and 2005 and 35 cents per share in 2004 total dividends paid were 41 million in 2006 425 million in 2005 and 389 million in 2004

contingencies 

the company is subject to various risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of business due in part to the competitive nature of the industries in which we participate our operations in developing markets outside the us changing commodity prices for the materials used in the manufacture of our products and changing capital markets where practicable we attempt to reduce these risks and uncertainties through the establishment of risk management policies and procedures including at times the use of derivative financial instruments as explained in item 7a of this report 

from time to time the company is subject to routine litigation incident to its business additionally the us environmental protection agency has designated ball as a potentially responsible party along with numerous other companies for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites our information at this time does not indicate that these matters will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity results of operations or financial condition of the company 

due to political and legal uncertainties in germany no nationwide system for returning beverage containers was in place at the time a mandatory deposit was imposed in january 2003 and nearly all retailers stopped carrying beverages in nonrefillable containers we responded to the resulting lower demand for beverage cans with several measures including reducing capacity and converting production lines from steel to aluminum to facilitate exports from germany to other european countries since may 1 2006 all retailers have been required to redeem all returned oneway containers as long as they sell such containers many retailers in germany have begun the process of implementing a returnable system for oneway containers the retailers and the filling and packaging industries have formed a committee to design a nationwide recollection system and several retailers have ordered and installed reverse vending machines in order to streamline the recollection system oneway packaging sales by german retailers have increased significantly since may 1 2006 albeit off a low base we believe it will take some time to recover from the significant decrease experienced beginning in 2003 usage will increase as oneway collection systems are more fully developed and consumers become educated regarding the systems and the reintroduction of oneway packaging 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period future events could affect these estimates see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report for a summary of the company’s critical and significant accounting policies 

the us and european economies have experienced minor general inflation during the past several years management believes that evaluation of ball’s performance during the periods covered by these consolidated financial statements should be based upon historical financial statements 

as described in note 13 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this annual report the irs has proposed to disallow ball’s deductions of interest expense for the tax years 2000 through 2004 incurred on loans under a companyowned life insurance plan that was established in 1986 ball has disputed the irs’s claims and the company believes the interest deductions will be sustained as filed

financial instruments and risk management 

in the ordinary course of business we employ established risk management policies and procedures to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices interest rates foreign currencies and prices of the company’s common stock in regard to common share repurchases although the instruments utilized involve varying degrees of credit market and interest risk the counterparties to the agreements are expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements 

we have estimated our market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis market risk exposure has been defined as the changes in fair value of derivative instruments financial instruments and commodity positions to test the sensitivity of our market risk exposure we have estimated the changes in fair value of market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in market prices or rates the results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized below 

commodity price risk 

we manage our commodity price risk in connection with market price fluctuations of aluminum primarily by entering into container sales contracts which generally include aluminumbased pricing terms that consider price fluctuations under our commercial supply contracts for aluminum purchases such terms generally include a fixed price floating price or an upper limit to the aluminum component pricing this matched pricing affects substantially all of our metal beverage packaging americas net sales we also at times use certain derivative instruments such as option and forward contracts as cash flow and fair value hedges of commodity price risk where there is not a passthrough arrangement in the sales contract 

most of the plastic packaging americas sales contracts negotiated through the end of 2006 include provisions to pass through resin cost changes as a result we believe we have minimal if any exposure related to changes in the cost of plastic resin most of our metal food and household products packaging americas sales contracts negotiated through the end of 2006 either include provisions permitting us to pass through some or all steel cost changes we incur or they incorporate annually negotiated steel costs we anticipate that we will be able to pass through the majority of the steel price increases that occur through the end of 2007 

in europe and asia the company manages aluminum and steel raw material commodity price risks through annual and longterm contracts for the purchase of the materials as well as certain sales of containers that reduce the company’s exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices within the current year these purchase and sales contracts include fixed price floating and passthrough pricing arrangements we also use forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges to minimize the company’s exposure to significant price changes for those sales contracts where there is not a passthrough arrangement 

considering the effects of derivative instruments the market’s ability to accept price increases and the company’s commodity price exposures a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the company’s steel aluminum and resin prices could result in an estimated 16 million aftertax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period additionally if foreign currency exchange rates were to change adversely by 10 percent we estimate there could be a 102 million aftertax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period for foreign currency exposures on raw materials actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates sensitivity to foreign currency exposures related to metal increased over prior years due to an increase in metal purchases and related payables at our foreign operations which are subject to foreign currency fluctuations 

the company is also exposed to fluctuations in prices for utilities such as natural gas and electricity as well as the cost of diesel fuel as a component of freight cost a hypothetical 10 percent increase in our utility prices could result in an estimated 84 million aftertax reduction of net earnings over a oneyear period a hypothetical 10 percent increase in our diesel fuel surcharge could result in an estimated 19 million aftertax reduction of net earnings over the same period actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates 

page 34 of 98 

interest rate risk 

our objective in managing exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we use a variety of interest rate swaps and options to manage our mix of floating and fixedrate debt interest rate instruments held by the company at december 31 2006 and 2005 included payfixed interest rate swaps payfixed swaps effectively convert variable rate obligations to fixed rate instruments 

based on our interest rate exposure at december 31 2006 assumed floating rate debt levels throughout 2007 and the effects of derivative instruments a 100 basis point increase in interest rates could result in an estimated 91 million aftertax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates and the timing of these changes 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to protect foreign cash flows and earnings associated with foreign exchange rate changes through the use of cash flow hedges in addition we manage foreign earnings translation volatility through the use of foreign currency options our foreign currency translation risk results from the european euro british pound canadian dollar polish zloty chinese renminbi brazilian real argentine peso and serbian dinar we face currency exposures in our global operations as a result of purchasing raw materials in us dollars and to a lesser extent in other currencies sales contracts are negotiated with customers to reflect cost changes and where there is not a foreign exchange passthrough arrangement the company uses forward and option contracts to manage foreign currency exposures 

considering the company’s derivative financial instruments outstanding at december 31 2006 and the currency exposures a hypothetical 10 percent reduction in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the us dollar could result in an estimated 192 million aftertax reduction in net earnings over a oneyear period this amount includes the 102 million currency exposure discussed above in the “commodity price risk” section this hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would also reduce our forecasted average debt balance by 757 million actual changes in market prices or rates may differ from hypothetical changes 

common share repurchases 

in connection with the company’s ongoing share repurchases the company periodically sells put options which give the purchasers of those options the right to sell shares of the company’s common stock to the company on specified dates at specified prices upon the exercise of those options our objective in selling put options is to lower the average purchase price of acquired shares there were no put option contracts outstanding at the end of 2006

 item 1   business 

 

ball corporation was organized in 1880 and incorporated in indiana in 1922 its principal executive offices are located at 10 longs peak drive broomfield colorado 800212510 the terms ball the company we and our as used herein refer to ball corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries 

ball is a manufacturer of metal and plastic packaging primarily for beverages and foods and a supplier of aerospace and other technologies and services to government and commercial customers 

information pertaining to the business of the company 

the company has determined that it has five reportable segments organized along a combination of product lines and geographic areas 1 north american metal beverage packaging 2 north american metal food packaging 3 north american plastic packaging 4 international packaging and 5 aerospace and technologies prior periods required to be shown in this annual report on form 10k annual report have been conformed to the current presentation 

a substantial part of our north american and international packaging sales are made directly to companies in packaged beverage and food businesses including sabmiller and bottlers of pepsicola and cocacola branded beverages and their affiliates that utilize consolidated purchasing groups sales to sabmiller plc and pepsico inc represented 11 percent and 10 percent of ball’s consolidated net sales respectively for the year ended december 31 2005 additional details about sales to major customers are included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements which can be found in item 8 of this annual report “financial statements and supplementary data” 

north american packaging segments 

our principal business in north america is the manufacture and sale of aluminum steel and polyethylene terephthalate pet containers primarily for beverages and foods packaging products are sold in highly competitive markets primarily based on quality service and price the north american packaging business is capital intensive requiring significant investment in machinery and equipment profitability is sensitive to selling prices production volumes labor transportation utility and warehousing costs as well as the availability and price of raw materials such as aluminum steel plastic resin and other direct materials these raw materials are generally available from several sources and we have secured what we consider to be adequate supplies and are not experiencing any shortages we believe we have limited our exposure related to changes in the costs of aluminum steel and plastic resin as a result of 1 the inclusion of provisions in most aluminum container sales contracts to pass through aluminum cost changes as well as the use of derivative instruments 2 the inclusion of provisions in certain steel container sales contracts to pass through steel cost changes and the existence of certain other steel container sales contracts that incorporate annually negotiated metal costs and 3 the inclusion of provisions in substantially all plastic container sales contracts to pass through resin cost changes in 2004 and 2005 we were able to pass through the majority of steel surcharges levied by producers and continually attempt to reduce manufacturing and other material costs as much as possible while raw materials and energy sources such as natural gas and electricity may from time to time be in short supply or unavailable due to external factors and the pass through of steel costs to our customers may be limited in some instances we cannot predict the timing or effects if any of such occurrences on future operations 

research and development rd efforts in the north american packaging segments are directed toward the development of new sizes and types of metal and plastic beverage and food containers as well as new uses for the current containers other research and development efforts in these segments seek to improve manufacturing efficiencies during 2004 we completed our expansion of the ball technology and innovation center located near denver colorado all of our north american rd activities are now conducted in that facility

north american metal beverage packaging 

north american metal beverage packaging represents ball’s largest segment accounting for 42 percent of consolidated net sales in 2005 decorated twopiece aluminum beverage cans are produced at 16 manufacturing facilities in the us and one each in canada and puerto rico can ends are produced within four of the us facilities as well as in a fifth facility that manufactures only ends metal beverage containers are primarily sold under multiyear supply contracts to fillers of carbonated soft drinks beer energy drinks and other beverages sales volumes of metal beverage containers in north america tend to be highest during the period from april through september 

through rocky mountain metal container llc a 5050 joint venture which is accounted for as an equity investment ball and coors brewing company coors a wholly owned subsidiary of molson coors brewing company operate beverage can and end manufacturing facilities in golden colorado the joint venture supplies coors with beverage cans and ends for its golden colorado and memphis tennessee breweries and supplies ends to its shenandoah virginia filling location ball receives management fees and technology licensing fees under agreements with the joint venture in addition to beverage containers supplied to coors from the joint venture ball supplies from its own facilities substantially all of coors’ metal container requirements for its shenandoah virginia filling location as well as other containers not manufactured by the joint venture 

based on publicly available industry information we estimate that our north american metal beverage container shipments in 2005 of approximately 32 billion cans were approximately 31 percent of total us and canadian shipments of metal beverage containers three producers manufacture substantially all of the remaining metal beverage containers two of these producers and three other independent producers also manufacture metal beverage containers in mexico available information indicates that north american metal beverage container shipments have been relatively flat during the past several years 

beverage container production capacity in the us canada and mexico exceeds demand in order to more closely balance capacity and demand within our business from time to time we consolidate our can and end manufacturing capacity into fewer more efficient facilities we also attempt to efficiently match capacity with the changes in customer demand for our packaging products to that end during the second quarter of 2005 we completed the conversion of a beverage can manufacturing line in our golden colorado plant from the production of 12ounce beverage cans to 24ounce beverage cans in the fourth quarter of 2005 we began the conversion of a line in our monticello indiana plant from 12ounce can manufacturing to a line capable of producing beverage cans in sizes up to 16 ounces the monticello conversion was substantially completed during january 2006 during 2005 ball commenced a project to upgrade and streamline its north american beverage can end manufacturing capabilities a project expected to result in productivity improvements and reduced manufacturing costs in connection with these activities the company recorded a pretax charge of 193 million 117 million after tax in the third quarter of 2005 we have installed the first production module in this multiyear project and the second and third modules are in the installation phase the project is expected to be completed in 2007 

the aluminum beverage container continues to compete aggressively with other packaging materials in the beer and carbonated soft drink industries the glass bottle has shown resilience in the packaged beer industry while carbonated soft drink and beer industry use of pet containers has grown in canada metal beverage containers have captured significantly lower percentages of the packaged beverage industry than in the us particularly in the packaged beer industry 

north american metal food packaging 

in addition to metal beverage containers ball produces twopiece and threepiece steel food containers for packaging vegetables fruit soups meat seafood nutritional products pet food and other products these containers are manufactured in 11 plants in the us and canada and sold primarily to food processors in north america in 2005 metal food container sales comprised 14 percent of consolidated net sales sales volumes of metal food containers in north america tend to be highest from june through october as a result of seasonal vegetable and salmon packs approximately 32 billion steel food containers were shipped in the us and canada in 2005 approximately 20 percent of which we estimate were shipped by ball 

page 2 of 97 

in 2005 the company recorded a pretax charge of 46 million 31 million after tax related to a reduction in the work force in a metal food container plant in ontario canada also in 2005 the company recorded a pretax charge of 66 million 44 million after tax for the closure of a threepiece food can manufacturing plant in quebec canada the quebec plant was closed and ceased operations in the third quarter of 2005 and an agreement has been reached to sell the land and building 

on march 17 2004 ball acquired conagra grocery products company’s conagra interest in ball western can company llc ball western can located in oakdale california and entered into a multiyear supply contract with conagra foods inc prior to the acquisition ball western can was a 5050 joint venture between ball and conagra and was accounted for under the equity method of accounting the acquisition of ball western can added approximately one billion units of annual capacity 

competitors in the metal food container product line include two national and a few regional suppliers and self manufacturers several producers in mexico also manufacture steel food containers steel food containers also compete with other packaging materials in the food industry including glass aluminum plastic paper and the standup pouch as a result demand for this product line may be affected during the next few years and we must increasingly focus on product innovation and cost reduction service quality and price are among the key competitive factors 

north american plastic packaging 

pet containers represented 8 percent of consolidated net sales in 2005 demand for containers made of pet has increased in the beverage and food markets with improved barrier technologies and other advances this growth in demand should continue assuming adequate supplies of resin continue to be available while pet beverage containers compete against metal glass and paper the historical increase in the sales of pet containers has come primarily at the expense of glass containers and through new market introductions we estimate our 2005 shipments of more than 5 billion plastic containers to be approximately 9 percent of total us and canadian pet container shipments 

the company operates five pet facilities in the us competition in the pet container industry includes several national and regional suppliers and self manufacturers service quality and price are important competitive factors the ability to produce customized differentiated plastic containers is becoming a key competitive factor 

most of ball’s pet containers are sold under longterm contracts to suppliers of bottled water and carbonated soft drinks including bottlers of pepsicola branded beverages and their affiliates that utilize consolidated purchasing groups our plastic beer containers are being produced for several of our customers and we are manufacturing plastic containers for the single serve juice and wine markets our line of heattektm pet plastic bottles for hotfilled beverages such as sports drinks and juices includes sizes from 8 ounces to 64 ounces 

international packaging 

the international packaging segment which accounted for 24 percent of ball’s consolidated net sales in 2005 consists of 10 beverage can plants and two beverage can end plants in europe as well as operations in the people’s republic of china prc of the 12 european plants four are located in germany three in the united kingdom two in france and one each in the netherlands poland and serbia in total the european plants produced approximately 12 billion cans in 2005 with approximately 50 percent of those being produced from steel and 50 percent from aluminum six of the can plants use aluminum and four use steel 

ball packaging europe is the second largest metal beverage container producer in europe with an estimated 29 percent of european shipments and produces twopiece beverage cans and can ends for producers of beer carbonated soft drinks mineral water fruit juices energy drinks and other beverages ball packaging europe is the largest metal beverage container manufacturer in germany france and the benelux countries and the second largest metal beverage container manufacturer in the united kingdom and poland near the end of the second quarter of 2005 ball completed the construction of a new aluminum beverage can manufacturing plant in belgrade serbia to serve the growing demand for beverage cans in southern and eastern europe 

page 3 of 97 

as in north america the metal beverage container continues to compete aggressively with other packaging materials used by the european beer and carbonated soft drink industries the glass bottle is heavily utilized in the packaged beer industry while the pet container is increasingly utilized in the carbonated soft drink juice and mineral water industries 

due to political and legal uncertainties in germany no nationwide system for returning beverage containers was in place at the time a mandatory deposit was imposed in january 2003 and nearly all retailers stopped carrying beverages in nonrefillable containers during 2003 and 2004 we responded to the resulting lower demand for beverage cans by reducing production at our german plants implementing aggressive cost reduction measures and increasing exports from germany to other countries in the region served by ball packaging europe we also closed a plant in the united kingdom shut down a production line in germany delayed capital investment projects in france and poland and converted one of our steel can production lines in germany to aluminum in order to facilitate additional can exports from germany in 2004 the german parliament adopted a new packaging ordinance imposing a 25 eurocent deposit on all oneway glass pet and metal containers for water beer and carbonated soft drinks as of may 1 2006 all retailers must redeem all returned oneway containers as long as they sell such containers major retailers in germany have begun the process of implementing a returnable system for oneway containers since they along with fillers now appear to accept the deposit as permanent the retailers and the filling and packaging industries have formed a committee to design a nationwide recollection system and several retailers have begun to order reverse vending machines in order to meet the may 1 2006 deadline 

the european beverage can business is capital intensive requiring significant investments in machinery and equipment profitability is sensitive to selling prices foreign exchange rates transportation costs production volumes labor and the costs and availability of certain raw materials such as aluminum and steel the european aluminum and steel industries are highly consolidated with three steel suppliers and three aluminum suppliers providing 95 percent of european requirements material supply contracts are generally for a period of one year although ball packaging europe has negotiated some longer term agreements aluminum is purchased primarily in us dollars while the functional currencies of ball packaging europe and its subsidiaries are nonus dollars this inherently results in a foreign exchange rate risk which the company minimizes through the use of derivative contracts in addition purchase and sales contracts include fixed price floating and passthrough pricing arrangements 

rd efforts in europe are directed toward the development of new sizes and types of metal containers as well as new uses for the current containers other research and development objectives in this segment include improving manufacturing efficiencies the european rd activities are conducted in a technical center located in bonn germany 

 

through ball asia pacific limited we are one of the largest beverage can manufacturers in the prc and believe that our facilities are among the most modern in that country capacity grew rapidly in the prc in the late 1990s resulting in a supplydemand imbalance to which we responded by rationalizing capacity demand growth has resumed in the past few years with projected annual growth expected to be in the 5 to 10 percent range in the near term ball is also undertaking selected capacity increases in its existing facilities in order to participate in the projected growth our current operations include the manufacture of aluminum cans and ends in three plants and highdensity plastic containers in two plants sales in the prc represented 3 percent of consolidated net sales we also participate in three joint ventures that manufacture aluminum cans and ends in brazil and in the prc in the fourth quarter of 2004 we recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts in respect of a receivable of a 35 percent owned joint venture in the prc in the first quarter of 2005 the remaining carrying value of the company’s investment in this joint venture was written off

aerospace and technologies 

the aerospace and technologies segment includes defense operations civil space systems and commercial space operations the defense operations business unit includes defense systems systems engineering services advanced antenna and video systems and electrooptics and cryogenic systems and components sales in the aerospace and technologies segment accounted for 12 percent of consolidated net sales in 2005 

the majority of the aerospace and technologies business involves work under contracts generally from one to five years in duration as a prime contractor or subcontractor for the national aeronautics and space administration nasa the us department of defense dod and other us government agencies contracts funded by the various agencies of the federal government represented 87 percent of segment sales in 2005 geopolitical events and executive and legislative branch priorities have yielded considerable growth opportunities in areas matching our core capabilities however there is strong competition for new business 

civil space systems defense systems and commercial space operations include hardware software and services sold primarily to us customers with emphasis on space science and exploration environmental and earth sciences and defense and intelligence applications major contractual activities frequently involve the design manufacture and testing of satellites remote sensors and ground station control hardware and software as well as related services such as launch vehicle integration and satellite operations 

other hardware activities include target identification warning and attitude control systems and components cryogenic systems for reactant storage and sensor cooling devices using either closedcycle mechanical refrigerators or opencycle solid and liquid cryogens star trackers which are generalpurpose stellar attitude sensors and faststeering mirrors additionally the aerospace and technologies segment provides diversified technical services and products to government agencies prime contractors and commercial organizations for a broad range of information warfare electronic warfare avionics intelligence training and space systems needs 

backlog in the aerospace and technologies segment was 761 million and 694 million at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively and consists of the aggregate contract value of firm orders excluding amounts previously recognized as revenue the 2005 backlog includes 458 million expected to be recognized in revenues during 2006 with the remainder expected to be recognized in revenues thereafter unfunded amounts included in backlog for certain firm government orders which are subject to annual funding were 500 million and 393 million at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively yeartoyear comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations 

the company’s aerospace and technologies segment has contracts with the us government or its contractors which have standard termination provisions the government retains the right to terminate contracts at its convenience however if contracts are terminated in this manner ball is entitled to reimbursement for allowable costs and profits on authorized work performed through the date of termination us government contracts are also subject to reduction or modification in the event of changes in government requirements or budgetary constraints 

patents 

in the opinion of the company none of its active patents is essential to the successful operation of its business as a whole 

research and development 

note 18 research and development in the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report contains information on company research and development activity additional information is also included in item 2 “properties” below

environment 

aluminum steel and pet containers are recyclable and significant amounts of used containers are being diverted from the solid waste stream and recycled using the most recent data available in 2004 approximately 51 percent of aluminum containers 62 percent of steel containers and 22 percent of the pet containers sold in the us were recycled 

recycling rates vary throughout europe but generally average 60 percent for aluminum and steel containers which exceeds the european union’s goal of 50 percent recycling for metals due in part to the intrinsic value of aluminum and steel metal packaging recycling rates in europe compare favorably to those of other packaging materials 

compliance with federal state and local laws relating to protection of the environment has not had a material adverse effect upon the capital expenditures earnings or competitive position of the company as more fully described under item 3 legal proceedings the us environmental protection agency and various state environmental agencies have designated the company as a potentially responsible party along with numerous other companies for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites however the company’s information at this time indicates that these matters will not have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity results of operations or financial condition of the company 

legislation which would prohibit tax or restrict the sale or use of certain types of containers and would require diversion of solid wastes such as packaging materials from disposal in landfills has been or may be introduced anywhere we operate while container legislation has been adopted in some jurisdictions similar legislation has been defeated in public referenda and legislative bodies in numerous others the company anticipates that continuing efforts will be made to consider and adopt such legislation in many jurisdictions in the future if such legislation were widely adopted it potentially could have a material adverse effect on the business of the company as well as on the container manufacturing industry generally in view of the company’s substantial global sales and investment in metal and pet container manufacturing however the packages we produce are widely used and perform well in us states and canadian provinces that have deposit systems 

employees 

at the end of december 2005 the company employed 13100 people worldwide including 9000 employees in the us and 4100 in other countries there are an additional 1000 employees employed in unconsolidated joint ventures in which ball participates approximately onethird of balls north american packaging plant employees are unionized and most of our european plant employees are union workers collective bargaining agreements with various unions in the us have terms of three to five years and those in europe have terms of one to two years the agreements expire at regular intervals and are customarily renewed in the ordinary course after bargaining between union and company representatives the company believes that its employee relations are good and that its training education and retention practices assist in enhancing employee satisfaction levels

 item 1a risk factors 

any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

the loss of a key customer could have a significant negative impact on our sales 

while we have diversified our customer base we do sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major beverage and packaged food companies some of which operate in north america europe and asia 

although approximately 70 percent of our customer contracts are longterm these contracts are terminable under certain circumstances such as our failure to meet quality or volume requirements because we depend on relatively few major customers our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss of any of these customers a reduction in the purchasing levels of these customers a strike or work stoppage by a significant number of these customers employees or an adverse change in the terms of the supply agreements with these customers 

the primary customers for our aerospace work are us government agencies or their prime contractors these sales represented approximately 11 percent of balls consolidated 2005 net sales our contracts with these customers are subject to among other things the following risks 

 

 

 

 

page 7 of 97 

we face competitive risks from many sources that may negatively impact our profitability 

competition within the packaging industry is intense increases in productivity combined with surplus capacity in the industry have maintained competitive pricing pressures the principal methods of competition in the general packaging industry are price service and quality some of our competitors may have greater financial technical and marketing resources our current or potential competitors may offer products at a lower price or products that are deemed superior to ours 

we are subject to competition from alternative products which could result in lower profits and reduced cash flows 

the metal beverage can is subject to significant competition from substitute products particularly plastic carbonated soft drink bottles made from pet single serve beer bottles and containers made of glass cardboard or other materials competition from plastic carbonated soft drink bottles is particularly intense in the united states and the united kingdom there can be no assurance that we will successfully compete against alternative beverage containers which could result in a reduction in our profits or cash flow 

we have a narrow product range and our business would suffer if usage of our products decreased 

for the 12 months ended december 31 2005 42 percent of our consolidated net sales were from the sale of metal beverage cans and we expect to derive a significant portion of our future revenues from the sale of metal beverage cans we sell no pet bottles in europe our business would suffer if the use of metal beverage cans decreased accordingly broad acceptance by consumers of aluminum and steel cans for a wide variety of beverages is critical to our future success if demand for glass and pet bottles increases relative to cans or the demand for aluminum and steel cans does not develop as expected our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our business financial condition and results of operations are subject to risks resulting from increased international operations 

we derived 24 percent of our total net sales from outside of north america in the year ended december 31 2005 the increased scope of international operations may lead to more volatile financial results and make it more difficult for us to manage our business reasons for this include but are not limited to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any of these factors could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations 

for the 12 months ended december 31 2005 72 percent of our net sales were attributable to operations with us dollars as their functional currency and 28 percent of our net sales were attributable to operations having other functional currencies with 12 percent of net sales attributable to the euro 

our reporting currency is the us dollar historically balls foreign operations including assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses have been denominated in various currencies other than the us dollar and we expect that our foreign operations will continue to be so denominated as a result the us dollar value of balls foreign operations have varied and will continue to vary with exchange rate fluctuations in this respect historically ball has been primarily exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate of the euro british pound canadian dollar polish zloty chinese renminbi brazilian real and serbian dinar 

page 8 of 97 

 

a decrease in the value of any of these currencies especially the euro relative to the us dollar could reduce our profits from foreign operations and the value of the net assets of our foreign operations when reported in us dollars in our financial statements this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations as reported in us dollars 

in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to currencies in which the earnings are generated may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations for purposes of accounting the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations where the local currency is the functional currency are translated using periodend exchange rates and the revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are translated using average exchange rates during each period translation gains and losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of shareholders equity 

we actively manage our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in order to mitigate the effect of foreign cash flow and reduce earnings volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes we primarily use forward contracts and options to manage our foreign currency exposures and as a result we experience gains and losses on these derivative positions offset in part by the impact of currency fluctuations on existing assets and liabilities 

our business operating results and financial condition are subject to particular risks in certain regions of the world 

we may experience an operating loss in one or more regions of the world for one or more periods which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition moreover overcapacity which often leads to lower prices exists in a number of regions including asia and latin america and may persist even if demand grows our ability to manage such operational fluctuations and to maintain adequate longterm strategies in the face of such developments will be critical to our continued growth and profitability 

if we fail to retain key management and personnel we may be unable to implement our key objectives 

we believe that our future success depends in large part on our experienced management team losing the services of key members of our management team could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet our objectives 

decreases in our ability to apply new technology and knowhow may affect our competitiveness 

our success depends in part on our ability to improve production processes and services we must also introduce new products and services to meet changing customer needs if we are unable to implement better production processes or to develop new products we may not be able to remain competitive with other manufacturers as a result our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

bad weather and climate changes may result in lower sales 

we manufacture packaging products primarily for beverages and foods unseasonably cool weather can reduce demand for certain beverages packaged in our containers in addition poor weather conditions or changes in climate that reduce crop yields of fruits and vegetables can adversely affect demand for our food containers creating potentially adverse effects on our business

we are vulnerable to fluctuations in the supply and price of raw materials 

we purchase aluminum steel plastic resin and other raw materials and packaging supplies from several sources while all such materials are available from numerous independent suppliers raw materials are subject to fluctuations in price attributable to a number of factors including general economic conditions the demand by other industries for the same raw materials and the availability of complementary and substitute materials although we enter into commodities purchase agreements from time to time and use derivative instruments to hedge our risk we cannot ensure that our current suppliers of raw materials will be able to supply us with sufficient quantities or at reasonable prices increases in raw material costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations because our north american contracts often pass raw material costs directly on to the customer increasing raw materials costs may not impact our nearterm profitability but could decrease our sales volume over time in europe our contracts do not typically allow us to pass on increased raw material costs and we regularly use derivative agreements to manage this risk however our hedging procedures may be insufficient and our results could be materially impacted if materials costs increase suddenly in europe 

prolonged work stoppages at plants with union employees could jeopardize our financial position 

as of december 31 2005 approximately onethird of our employees in north america and most of our employees in europe were covered by one or more collective bargaining agreements these collective bargaining agreements have staggered expirations over the next three years although we consider our employee relations to be generally good a prolonged work stoppage or strike at any facility with union employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition we cannot assure you that upon the expiration of existing collective bargaining agreements new agreements will be reached without union action or that any such new agreements will be on terms satisfactory to us 

our business is subject to substantial environmental remediation and compliance costs 

our operations are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental hazards such as emissions to air discharges to water the handling and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes and the cleanup of hazardous substances the us environmental protection agency has designated us along with numerous other companies as a potentially responsible party for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites based on available information we do not believe that any costs incurred in connection with such sites will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations capital expenditures or competitive position 

if we were required to write down all or part of our goodwill our net earnings and net worth could be materially adversely affected 

we have 12586 million of net goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2005 we are required to periodically determine if our goodwill has become impaired in which case we would write down the impaired portion of our goodwill if we were required to write down all or part of our goodwill our net earnings and net worth could be materially adversely affected 

if the investments in balls pension plans do not perform as expected we may have to contribute additional amounts to the plans which would otherwise be available to cover operating expenses 

ball maintains noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of its us employees which we fund based on certain actuarial assumptions the plans assets consist primarily of common stocks and fixed income securities if the investments in the plan do not perform at expected levels then we will have to contribute additional funds to ensure that the program will be able to pay out benefits as scheduled such an increase in funding could result in a decrease in our available cash flow and net earnings and the recognition of such an increase could result in a reduction to our shareholders equity we recorded an increase in our minimum pension liability in the fourth quarter of 2005 largely as a reduction in the assumed discount rate this increase in pension liability was reflected as an increase in other liabilities and a corresponding decrease in stockholders equity

our significant debt could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the notes 

we have a significant amount of debt on december 31 2005 we had total debt of 15897 million our ratio of earnings to fixed charges as of that date was 34 times see exhibit 12 attached to this annual report our high level of debt could have important consequences including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition a substantial portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates if market interest rates increase variablerate debt will create higher debt service requirements which would adversely affect our cash flow while we sometimes enter into agreements limiting our exposure any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk 

we will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 

our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt including the notes and to fund planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that may be beyond our control 

based on our current level of operations we believe our cash flow from operations available cash and available borrowings under our new credit facilities will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs for the next several years barring any unforeseen circumstances which are beyond our control 

we cannot assure you however that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our new credit facilities or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt including the notes or to fund our other liquidity needs we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt including the notes on or before maturity we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our debt including our new credit facilities and our senior notes on commercially reasonable terms or at all

europe 

ball packaging europe bpe together with other plaintiffs is contesting in federal and state administrative courts the enactment of a mandatory deposit for nonrefillable containers based on the german packaging regulation verpackungsverordnung the proceedings in the state administrative court are still active in two states bavaria and hamburg and the proceedings in the other states have been declared inactive or have been retracted the federal constitutional court in karsruhe bundesverfassungsgericht has denied the motions of the plaintiffs for judgment at the federal level a proceeding with the administrative court in berlin verwaltungsgericht berlin is still pending bpe filed a motion for an expedited procedure with the objective of reinstating the suspensive effect of the procedure the administrative court has denied the motion bpe has filed an appeal against this decision with the higher administrative court in berlin oberverwaltungsgericht berlin which also denied the motion the potential financial risk of legal fees which bpe may incur in connection with the procedures set out above amounts to approximately €280000 and has been accrued by bpe the european court of justice has issued a judgment that confirmed that the german deposit legislation violated among other european union eu regulations the principle of free trade of goods within the eu and disadvantaged the importers of beverages versus german beverage producers following this judgment two german law firms have suggested that importers of beverages and possibly even local beverage producers may be able to market beverages in germany without mandatory deposit until a germanywide functioning return system is implemented the german government does not share this point of view and has indicated that it will continue to apply the mandatory deposit regulations 

in december 2004 the german government passed new legislation that imposes a mandatory deposit of 25 eurocents on nonrefillable containers in respect of all beverages except milk wine fruit juices and certain alcoholic beverages beverages in beverage carton packaging are also excluded from the deposit the legislation required that the socalled “island solutions” are to be terminated after an interim period of 12 months after the legislation takes effect the new legislation came into force in may 2005 island solutions therefore will no longer be permissible as of may 1 2006 the relevant industries including bpe and its competitors are currently setting up a germanywide return system planned to be operational in or about may 2006 based upon the information or lack thereof available to the company at the present time the company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity results of operations or financial condition of the company

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

management’s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes ball corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as “ball” or “the company” or “we” and “our” in the following discussion and analysis 

business overview 

ball corporation is one of the world’s leading suppliers of metal and plastic packaging to the beverage and food industries our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses and are currently manufactured in 49 plants around the world we also supply aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers 

we sell our packaging products primarily to major beverage and food producers with which we have developed longterm customer relationships this is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of longterm supply contracts while we have diversified our customer base we do sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major beverage and food companies in north america europe and the people’s republic of china prc as do our equity joint ventures in brazil the us and the prc we also purchase raw materials from relatively few suppliers because of our customer and supplier concentration our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss of a major customer or supplier or a material change in a supply agreement with a major customer or supplier although our longterm relationships and contracts mitigate these risks 

in the rigid packaging industry sales and earnings can be improved by reducing costs developing new products expanding volume and increasing pricing where possible we are in the early stages of a project to upgrade and streamline our north american beverage can end manufacturing capabilities a project that will result in productivity gains and cost reductions while the us and canadian beverage container manufacturing industry is relatively mature the european prc and brazilian beverage can markets are growing excluding the effects of the german mandatory deposit discussed in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements and are expected to continue to grow we are capitalizing on the european growth by continuing to reconfigure some of our european can manufacturing lines and by opening in 2005 a new beverage can manufacturing plant in belgrade serbia 

ball’s consolidated earnings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations we attempt to mitigate this exposure through the use of derivative financial instruments as discussed in the “financial instruments and risk management” sections within item 7a and item 8 note 16 of this report 

as part of our packaging strategy we are focused on developing and marketing new and existing products that meet the everexpanding needs of our beverage and food customers these innovations include new shapes sizes opening features and other functional benefits of both metal and plastic packaging this packaging development activity helps us maintain and expand our supply positions with major beverage and food customers 

the primary customers for the products and services provided by our aerospace and technologies segment are us government agencies or their prime contractors it is possible that federal budget reductions and priorities or changes in agency budgets could limit future funding and new contract awards or prolong contract performance 

we recognize sales under longterm contracts in the aerospace and technologies segment using the costtocost percentage of completion method of accounting our present contract mix consists of approximately twothirds costplus contracts which are billed at our costs plus an agreed upon profit component and approximately onethird fixed price contracts we include time and material contracts in the fixed price category because such contracts typically provide for the sale of engineering labor at fixed hourly rates throughout the period of contract performance we regularly reevaluate and if necessary revise our estimates of total contract revenue total contract cost and progress toward completion because of contract payment schedules limitations on funding and other contract terms our sales and accounts receivable for this segment include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed 

page 19 of 97 

management uses various measures to evaluate company performance the primary financial measures we use are earnings before interest and taxes ebit earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda diluted earnings per share economic value added operating earnings after tax as defined by the company less a capital charge based on invested capital times our cost of capital operating cash flow and free cash flow generally defined by the company as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures these financial measures may be adjusted at times for items that affect comparability between periods nonfinancial measures in the packaging segments include production spoilage rates quality control measures safety statistics and production and shipment volumes additional measures used to evaluate performance in the aerospace and technologies segment include contract revenue realization award and incentive fees realized proposal win rates and backlog including awarded contracted and funded backlog 

we recognize that attracting and retaining quality employees is critically important to the success of ball and because of this we strive to pay employees competitively and encourage their prudent ownership of the company’s common stock for most management employees a meaningful portion of compensation is at risk as an incentive dependent upon economic value added operating performance for more senior positions more compensation is at risk through our employee stock purchase plan and 401k plan which matches employee contributions with ball common stock many employees regardless of organizational level have opportunities to participate as ball shareholders 

consolidated sales and earnings 

the company has determined that it has five reportable segments organized along a combination of product lines and geographic areas  north american metal beverage packaging north american metal food packaging north american plastic packaging international packaging and aerospace and technologies prior periods have been conformed to the current presentation we also have investments in companies in the us the prc and brazil which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and accordingly their results are not included in segment sales or earnings 

north american metal beverage packaging 

the north american metal beverage packaging segment consists of operations located in the us canada and puerto rico which manufacture metal container products used primarily in beverage packing this segment accounted for 42 percent of consolidated net sales in 2005 43 percent in 2004 sales were slightly higher in 2005 than in 2004 as lower 2005 sales volumes were offset by higher aluminum prices passed through to our customers metal beverage container volumes in 2005 were 25 percent below the previous year’s levels as a result of poor weather in the first quarter temporary volume reductions and general softness in the beer and carbonated soft drink markets net changes in contracted volumes are expected to result in the restoration of the reduced 2005 volumes during 2006 and beyond sales were 3 percent higher in 2004 than in 2003 contributing to the increase were the pass through of aluminum price increases and higher volumes in our specialty can products partially offset by declines in standard 12ounce can volumes sales in 2004 improved over 2003 due to the 28 million acquisition in march 2003 of metal packaging international inc a small producer of metal beverage can ends based on publicly available information we estimate that our shipments of metal beverage containers were approximately 31 percent of total us and canadian shipments in 2005 

we continue to focus efforts on the growing custom beverage can business which includes cans of different shapes diameters and fill volumes and cans with added functional attributes for new products and product line extensions the conversion of a manufacturing line in our golden colorado plant from 12ounce to 24ounce cans was completed in the second quarter of 2005 we also announced plans to convert a line in our monticello indiana plant from 12ounce can manufacturing to a line capable of producing beverage cans in sizes up to 16 ounces this conversion was substantially completed in january 2006 

earnings in the segment were 2298 million in 2005 compared to 2791 million in 2004 and 2508 million in 2003 the third quarter of 2005 included a pretax charge of 193 million 117 million after tax related to a project to significantly upgrade and streamline our north american beverage can end manufacturing capabilities the charge included the write off of obsolete equipment spare parts and tooling as well as employee termination costs over time this capital project is expected to result in productivity improvements and reduced manufacturing costs 

page 20 of 97 

we have installed the first production module in this multiyear project and the second and third modules are in the installation phase the project is expected to be completed in 2007 

also contributing to lower segment earnings in 2005 were higher freight costs from fuel surcharges higher other direct material and utility costs and a 9 million increase in cost of sales due to rising raw material costs under the lifo lastinfirstout method of accounting energy freight and other direct material costs were 32 million higher in 2005 than in 2004 partially offset by efficiency gains cost controls and lower selling general and administrative costs in 2005 while pricing pressures continue on our raw materials other direct materials and freight and utility costs we continue to work with both customers and suppliers to maintain our volumes as well as preserve our margins 

the improvement in segment earnings in 2004 versus 2003 was the result of higher sales and production volumes improved product mix and cost reduction programs partially offsetting these 2004 earnings improvements was an increase in cost of sales due to rising raw material costs under the lifo lastinfirstout method of accounting in the fourth quarter of 2003 a gain of 16 million was recorded in connection with the sale of a metal beverage container facility that was shut down in december 2001 

north american metal food packaging 

the north american metal food packaging segment consists of operations located in the us and canada which manufacture metal container products used primarily in food packaging segment sales in 2005 comprised 14 percent of consolidated net sales 14 percent in 2004 and were 6 percent higher than 2004 sales sales in 2005 reflected higher prices from the pass through of higher raw material costs sales volumes were flat compared to 2004 levels including in the first quarter of 2005 the inclusion of a full quarter’s results from our oakdale california facility which was acquired in march 2004 discussed below sales were higher in 2004 than in 2003 due primarily to the acquisition of the oakdale california facility higher selling prices as a result of the pass through of raw material costs and some prebuying by customers in the fourth quarter of 2004 ahead of expected 2005 steel price increases during 2004 and 2005 we were able to pass through the majority of the steel price increases and surcharges levied by steel producers we estimate our 2005 shipments of 67 billion cans to be approximately 20 percent of total us and canadian metal food container shipments based on publicly available trade information 

on march 17 2004 we acquired conagra grocery products company’s conagra interest in ball western can company llc ball western can for 30 million ball western can located in oakdale california was established in 2000 as a 5050 joint venture between ball and conagra and prior to the acquisition was accounted for by ball using the equity method of accounting ball and conagra’s parent company conagra foods inc signed a longterm agreement under which ball provides metal food containers to conagra food packing locations in california the acquisition of ball western can added approximately one billion units of annual capacity 

segment earnings were 116 million in 2005 compared to 443 million in 2004 and 198 million in 2003 the fourth quarter of 2005 included a pretax charge of 46 million 31 million after tax for pension severance and other employee benefit costs related to a reduction in force in our burlington ontario plant the second quarter of 2005 included a pretax charge of 88 million 59 million after tax for the closure of a threepiece food can manufacturing plant in quebec this action was taken to better match capacity to demand the quebec plant was closed and ceased operations in the third quarter of 2005 and an agreement has been reached to sell the land and building which resulted in the second quarter charge being offset by a 22 million gain 15 million after tax in the fourth quarter to adjust the quebec plant to net realizable value 

also contributing to lower segment earnings in 2005 were higher freight costs from fuel surcharges higher other direct material and utility costs and an 85 million increase in cost of sales due to rising raw material costs under the lifo lastinfirstout method of accounting energy freight and other direct material costs were 16 million higher in 2005 than in 2004 partially offset by efficiency gains cost controls and lower selling general and administrative costs in 2005 while pricing pressures continue on all of our raw materials other direct materials and freight and utility costs we continue to work with both customers and suppliers to maintain our volumes as well as preserve our margins 

 

page 21 of 97 

the improvement in earnings in 2004 versus 2003 was the result of strong fourth quarter 2004 food can sales higher production volumes improved product mix and cost reduction programs in addition 2003 earnings were negatively impacted by 11 million of startup costs associated with a new twopiece food can manufacturing line in milwaukee partially offsetting these 2004 earnings improvements was an increase in cost of sales due to rising raw material costs under the lifo lastinfirstout method of accounting in the first quarter of 2003 a net charge of 14 million was booked to record the costs of closing a metal food container plant offset by a gain from the sale of a previously closed plant 

north american plastic packaging 

the north american plastic packaging segment consists of operations located in the us which manufacture polyethylene terephthalate pet plastic container products used mainly in beverage packaging segment sales in 2005 comprised 8 percent of consolidated sales 7 percent in 2004 and increased 22 percent compared to 2004 the sales increase was related to the pass through to our customers of higher resin prices as well as 75 percent higher sales volumes in 2005 compared to 2004 related to higher demand for barrier and heatset containers that provide longer shelflife for products combined with strong demand for plastic water bottles sales in 2004 were 7 percent higher than in 2003 primarily as a result of several new preform sales contracts secured during 2004 and the pass through of raw material price increases carbonated soft drink and water sales volumes in 2004 were lower than expected primarily due to reduced demand on the east coast resulting from competitive pressures and a delay in the commencement of a new customer supply opportunity on the west coast although only a small percentage of our total volume juice sports drinks and beer container sales increased in 2005 and are expected to grow considerably in the future as more focus is given to these specialty markets and the development of our heattektm business we estimate our 2005 shipments of more than 5 billion bottles to be approximately 9 percent of total us and canadian pet container shipments 

segment earnings were 174 million in 2005 compared to 116 million in 2004 and 123 million in 2003 the improvement in earnings in 2005 was the result of higher sales and production volumes and growth in specialty products partially offsetting these improvements in 2005 were higher utility costs segment earnings in 2004 and 2003 included 2 million and 27 million respectively of costs associated with the relocation of the plastics offices and research and development facility from atlanta georgia to colorado earnings in 2004 were also negatively impacted by continued pricing pressures on commodity plastic containers for carbonated soft drink customers segment earnings in 2004 also included a gain of 07 million as costs related to the shut down and relocation of the atlanta plastics offices were less than expected 

international packaging 

international packaging includes the production and sale of metal beverage container products manufactured and sold in europe and asia as well as plastic containers manufactured and sold in asia this segment accounted for 24 percent of consolidated net sales in 2005 23 percent in 2004 

ball packaging europe which represents an estimated 29 percent of the total european metal beverage container manufacturing capacity has manufacturing plants located in germany the united kingdom france the netherlands poland and serbia european sales were 7 percent higher in 2005 than in 2004 primarily as a result of an 85 percent increase in sales volumes the continued weak demand in germany as a result of the mandatory deposit legislation previously reported on is being offset by stronger demand elsewhere in europe including southern and eastern europe sales in 2005 were adversely affected by unseasonably cool wet weather in parts of europe european sales were 10 percent higher in 2004 than in 2003 as a result of a stronger euro higher selling prices and successful export programs from the german plants to other european countries 

in response to increased demand for custom cans in europe a steel can manufacturing line in the netherlands was converted to aluminum custom cans during the first quarter of 2005 the construction of a new beverage can plant in belgrade serbia was completed near the end of the second quarter of 2005 to serve the growing demand for beverage cans in southern and eastern europe the plant became fully operational during the third quarter of 2005 the serbian plant was constructed to accommodate a second can production line and a can end manufacturing module for future growth in the first quarter of 2004 a steel can manufacturing line in germany was converted to the production of aluminum cans and in the first quarter of 2003 one german can manufacturing line was idled

sales in the prc in 2005 increased 21 percent over 2004 levels which were 18 percent higher than in 2003 the increases were largely the result of higher volumes the overall beverage can market in the prc was also strong throughout 2005 with expectations of continued growth into 2006 we expect demand for aluminum beverage cans to grow in the coming years as both multinational and chinese beverage fillers expand their markets 

international packaging segment earnings of 1818 million in 2005 decreased 8 percent compared to 2004 earnings of 198 million the fourth quarter of 2005 included a 93 million gain primarily resulting from the final settlement of all tax obligations related to liquidated china operations for amounts less than originally estimated first quarter 2005 segment earnings included a 34 million expense for the write off of the remaining carrying value of an equity investment in the prc earnings in 2004 included income of 137 million related to the realization of proceeds on assets in the prc being in excess of amounts previously estimated and costs of liquidation being less than anticipated in a business consolidation charge taken in 2001 

higher material energy and transportation costs as well as second and third quarter start up costs related to a line conversion in the netherlands and the new serbia plant had a negative effect on 2005 segment earnings partially offsetting these higher costs were lower selling general and administrative costs earnings improved in 2004 compared to 2003 due to a stronger euro and higher profit margins in both europe and the prc due in large part to operational cost reduction programs segment earnings in 2004 were also improved over 2003 by the nonrecurrence of purchase accounting adjustments which increased ball packaging europe’s cost of sales in 2003 the stronger euro improved our net earnings per diluted share by 008 in 2004 compared to 2003 

during the fourth quarter of 2004 sanshui jianlibao ftb packaging limited sanshui jfp a 35 percent owned prc joint venture experienced a greater than customary seasonal production slowdown caused by cash flow difficulties after discussions with representatives of the local chinese government which had temporarily taken control of our joint venture partner’s business we recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts in respect of sanshui jfp’s receivable from the joint venture partner our share of the bad debt provision amounted to 152 million and is included in the 2004 consolidated statement of earnings as equity in results of affiliates information learned late in the first quarter of 2005 led the company to record expense of 34 million to write off the remaining carrying value of this investment 

in june 2001 we announced a plan to exit the general line metal can business in the prc and reduce our prc beverage can manufacturing capacity by closing two plants a 2377 million pretax charge 185 million after tax and minority interest impact was recorded in connection with this reorganization we recorded earnings of 93 million during 2005 137 million in 2004 and 33 million in 2003 as restructuring activities were completed resulting in realization on assets in excess of amounts previously estimated as well as costs incurred being less than estimated including settlement of tax matters all costs and transactions related to the prc restructuring have been concluded 

aerospace and technologies 

aerospace and technologies segment sales represented 12 percent of 2005 consolidated net sales 12 percent in 2004 and were 6 percent higher than in 2004 sales in 2004 were 22 percent higher than in 2003 the progressively higher sales resulted from a combination of newly awarded contracts and additions to previously awarded contracts the aerospace and technologies business won a number of large strategic contracts and delivered a great deal of sophisticated space and defense instrumentation throughout the threeyear period earnings of 547 million in 2005 were 12 percent higher compared to 2004 despite an expense of 38 million in the first quarter of 2005 for the write down to net realizable value of an equity investment in an aerospace company this investment was sold in october 2005 for approximately its carrying value the improvement in earnings was primarily the result of higher sales and improved program performance net earnings decreased in 2004 by 2 percent compared to 2003 largely due to increased pension costs and higher costs incurred on certain costplus contracts without corresponding additional fees as these contracts reached completion in addition 2003 margins included 8 million due to successfully achieving milestones in two key programs

on july 4 2005 the deep impact spacecraft accomplished its goal of collecting data from comet tempel 1 83 million miles from earth using an impactor spacecraft to strike the comet and recording the results of the impact with a flyby spacecraft the deep impact mission has provided groundbreaking scientific information regarding the origins of the solar system some of the segment’s other highprofile contracts include worldview an advanced commercial remote sensing satellite the james webb space telescope a successor to the hubble space telescope the spacebased space surveillance system which will detect and track space objects such as satellites and orbital debris npoess the nextgeneration satellite weather monitoring system and a number of antennas for the joint strike fighter 

sales to the us government either directly as a prime contractor or indirectly as a subcontractor represented 87 percent of segment sales in 2005 82 percent in 2004 and 96 percent of segment sales in 2003 the percentage representing us government sales has decreased compared to 2003 due to growing revenues related to the worldview contract contracted backlog for the aerospace and technologies segment at december 31 2005 and 2004 was 761 million and 694 million respectively yeartoyear comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations 

for additional information regarding the company’s segments see the summary of business segment information in note 2 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report the charges recorded for business consolidation activities were based on estimates by ball management actuaries and other independent parties and were developed from information available at the time if actual outcomes vary from the estimates the differences will be reflected in current period earnings in the consolidated statement of earnings and identified as business consolidation gains and losses additional details about our business consolidation activities and associated costs are provided in note 4 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report 

selling and administrative expenses 

selling and administrative expenses were 2316 million 2679 million and 2342 million for 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively expenses in 2005 were lower in all areas of the company due largely to lower employee compensation and benefit costs including the company’s deposit share program and economicvalueadded based incentive compensation plans in addition foreign currency hedging gains were higher in 2005 than in 2004 these lower costs were partially offset by higher pension costs higher accounts receivable securitization fees and the write down of the prc and aerospace equity investments in the first quarter of 2005 the increase in 2004 compared to 2003 was due to higher costs related to the company’s deposit share program higher pension and incentive costs costs associated with sarbanesoxley compliance in 2004 higher research and development costs the effects of foreign exchange rates and growth in our aerospace and technologies segment in 2005 we reduced our us pension plan discount rate from 625 percent to 6 percent resulting in 54 million higher us pension expense for the year compared to 2004 most of which was included in cost of sales in 2004 we also reduced our us pension plan discount rate from 675 percent to 625 percent resulting in 83 million higher us pension expense for the year compared to 2003 

for the us pension plans we intend to maintain our current return on asset assumption at 85 percent for 2006 while further reducing the discount rate assumption to 575 percent based on these assumptions us pension expense for 2006 is anticipated to increase 105 million compared to 2005 most of which will be included in cost of sales pension expense in europe and canada combined is expected to be slightly lower than the 2005 expense a reduction of the plan asset return assumption by one quarter of a percentage point would result in additional expense of approximately 19 million while a quarter of a percentage point reduction in the discount rate would result in approximately 38 million of additional expense additional information regarding the company’s pension plans is provided in note 13 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report 

on october 26 2005 ball’s board of directors approved the accelerated vesting of the outofthemoney unvested nonqualified stock options granted in april 2005 the acceleration affects approximately 665000 options granted to approximately 290 employees at an exercise price of 3974 the accelerated vesting of these nonqualified options will allow the company to eliminate approximately 5 million of pretax expense approximately 3 million after tax over the next four years

interest and taxes 

consolidated interest expense was 1164 million in 2005 including debt refinancing costs of 193 million 1037 million in 2004 and 1411 million in 2003 including debt refinancing costs of 152 million the progressively lower expense was due to lower average borrowings and higher capitalized interest the debt refinancing costs in 2005 of 193 million were costs associated with the refinancing of the company’s senior credit facilities and the redemption in the last half of 2005 of the company’s 775 senior notes which were due in august 2006 the debt refinancing costs in 2003 of 152 million were associated with the early redemption of the company’s 825 senior subordinated notes in august 2003 

ball’s consolidated effective income tax rate for 2005 was 287 percent compared to 32 percent in 2004 and 313 percent in 2003 the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the net tax benefit recorded on the repatriation of foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act of 2004 jobs act the tax benefit on business consolidation costs applied at the marginal tax rate increased research and development tax credits and the manufacturing deduction effective in 2005 under the jobs act further details of the amounts repatriated under the jobs act are available in note 12 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report these benefits were somewhat offset by the fact that no tax benefit was provided in respect of the equity investment write downs in the first quarter of 2005 the 38 million write down of the aerospace investment is not tax deductible while the realization of tax deductibility of the 34 million prc write down which will be a capital loss is not reasonably assured as the company does not have nor does it anticipate any capital gains to offset the capital losses 

ball’s consolidated effective income tax rate for 2004 was 32 percent compared to 313 percent in 2003 the overall 2004 effective rate was slightly higher primarily due to higher north american earnings than in 2003 but continues to reflect a low consolidated european income tax rate due to lower profits in germany reflecting the impact of the refundable mandatory deposit on nonrefillable containers imposed on january 1 2003 and a tax holiday in poland germany has the highest tax rate of the european countries in which ball has operations 

in connection with the internal revenue service’s irs examination of ball’s consolidated income tax returns for the tax years 2000 through 2003 the irs has proposed to disallow ball’s deductions of interest expense incurred on loans under a companyowned life insurance plan that has been in place for more than 19 years ball believes that its interest deductions will be sustained as filed and therefore no provision for loss has been accrued the irs’s proposed adjustments would result in an increase in taxable income for the years 1999 through 2003 of 467 million and a corresponding increase in taxable income for subsequent tax years 2004 and 2005 in the amount of 202 million with a corresponding increase in tax expense of 264 million plus any related penalties and interest expense the examination reports for the 2000 to 2003 examination have been forwarded to the appeals division of the irs and no further action has taken place to change ball’s position 

results of equity affiliates 

equity in the earnings of affiliates in 2005 is primarily attributable to our 50 percent ownership in packaging investments in north america and brazil earnings in 2004 included the results of a minorityowned aerospace business which was sold in october 2005 and a 152 million loss representing ball’s share of a provision for doubtful accounts related to its 35 percent owned interest in sanshui jfp discussed above in “international packaging” after consideration of the prc loss earnings were 155 million in 2005 compared to 158 million in 2004 and 113 million in 2003 the higher earnings since 2003 were primarily due to improved results in our packaging joint ventures in brazil and north america

subsequent event 

on february 14 2006 the company entered into a definitive merger agreement in which ball will acquire us can corporation’s us can us and argentinean operations for 11 million shares of ball common stock and the assumption of 550 million of us can’s debt the transaction is expected to close by the end of the first quarter 2006 us can is the largest manufacturer of aerosol cans in the us and also manufactures paint cans plastic containers and custom and specialty cans in 10 plants in the us aerosol cans are also produced in the two manufacturing plants in argentina us can’s us and argentinean operations had sales of approximately 600 million unaudited in 2005 upon closing the acquisition of us can the company intends to refinance 550 million of existing us can debt at significantly lower interest rates the refinancing will be completed with ball’s issuance of a new series of senior notes and an increase in bank debt under the new senior credit facilities put in place in the fourth quarter of 2005 

 

critical and significant accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows and capital expenditures 

cash flows from operating activities were 5588 million in 2005 compared to 5359 million in 2004 and 364 million in 2003 the lower amount generated in 2003 included 1383 million for the payment in january 2003 of an accrued withholding tax obligation related to the acquisition of ball packaging europe further discussed below which was funded by the seller at the time of closing by the inclusion of €131 million of additional cash 

management internally uses a free cash flow measure 1 to evaluate the company’s operating results 2 for planning purposes 3 to evaluate strategic investments and 4 to evaluate the company’s ability to incur and service debt free cash flow is not a defined term under us generally accepted accounting principles and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures the company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less additions to property plant and equipment capital spending free cash flow is typically derived directly from the company’s cash flow statements however it may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods an example of such an item excluded in 2003 is the 1383 million withholding tax payment liability assumed in the acquisition of ball packaging europe in december 2002 discussed above we believe this is not a comparable free cash flow outflow of the company as it was funded by the seller 

based on this our consolidated free cash flow is summarized as follows 

 

 

 

cash flows from operating activities in 2005 were negatively impacted by higher cash taxes this resulted in a decrease in the deferred income taxes payable of 585 million in 2005 compared to an estimated increase in deferred taxes of 428 million in 2004 the primary causes of the increase in current income taxes and decrease in deferred income taxes are the reduction in 2005 of taxdeductible pension costs versus 2004 the impact in 2005 of the repatriation of foreign earnings and a reduction of tax versus book depreciation expense as tax depreciation was accelerated in prior years primarily due to bonus tax depreciation permitted in the tax laws after september 11 2001 cash flows from operating activities were positively affected in 2005 by lower accounts receivable higher accounts payable and lower pension contributions 

page 26 of 97 

 

cash flow in 2004 compared to 2003 included higher earnings and higher accounts payable offset by higher accounts receivable and inventories as well as higher pension plan contributions inventories and accounts payable were higher due to increased purchases of raw materials and accounts receivable were higher partially as a result of strong december food can sales 

based on information currently available we estimate cash flows from operating activities for 2006 to be approximately 550 million capital spending to be approximately 300 million and free cash flow to be in the 250 million range capital spending of 2917 million in 2005 was above depreciation and amortization expense of 2135 million as we invested capital in our best performing operations including projects to increase custom can capabilities improve beverage can end making productivity convert lines from steel to aluminum in europe and complete a new beverage can manufacturing plant in belgrade serbia as well as expenditures in the aerospace and technologies segment 

debt facilities and refinancing 

interestbearing debt at december 31 2005 decreased 71 million to 15897 million from 16607 million at december 31 2004 this decrease includes 3581 million for net repurchases of common stock and 2917 million of capital spending partially offset by the effects of the lower euro exchange rate and operating cash flow 

on october 13 2005 ball refinanced its senior secured credit facilities the new senior secured facilities extend debt maturities at lower interest rate spreads and provide ball with additional borrowing capacity for future growth during the third and fourth quarters of 2005 ball redeemed its 775 senior notes due august 2006 primarily through the drawdown of funds under the new credit facilities the refinancing and redemption resulted in a pretax debt refinancing charge of 193 million 123 million after tax to reflect the call premium associated with the senior notes and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs 

the new senior credit facilities which currently bear interest at variable rates and are due in october 2011 are comprised of the following 1 ₤85 million term a loan 2 €350 million term b loan 3 c165 million term c loan 4 a multicurrency longterm revolving credit facility which provides the company with up to the equivalent of 715 million and 5 a canadian longterm revolving credit facility which provides the company with up to the equivalent of 35 million at december 31 2005 547 million was available under the multicurrency revolving credit facility the company also had 267 million of shortterm uncommitted credit facilities available at the end of the year of which 1068 million was outstanding 

during the first quarter of 2004 ball repaid €31 million 38 million of its previous euro denominated term loan b and reduced the interest rate by 50 basis points during the fourth quarter of 2003 ball repaid 160 million of its previous us dollar denominated term loan b and €25 million of its previous euro denominated term loan b at the time of the early repayment the interest rate on the us portion of the term loan b was reduced by 50 basis points interest expense during the first quarter of 2004 and the fourth quarter of 2003 included 05 million and 29 million respectively for the write off of the unamortized financing costs associated with the repaid loans 

on august 8 2003 ball refinanced 825 senior subordinated notes due in 2008 through the private placement of 250 million of 6875 senior notes due in 2012 issued at a price of 102 effective yield to maturity of 658 percent in connection with the refinancing of the higher interest debt in the third quarter of 2003 a pretax charge of 152 million was recorded as interest expense which consisted of the payment of a 103 million call premium and the write off of 49 million of unamortized financing costs 

 

the company has a receivables sales agreement that provides for the ongoing revolving sale of a designated pool of trade accounts receivable of ball’s north american packaging operations up to 225 million as of december 31 2005 200 million as of december 31 2004 the agreement qualifies as offbalance sheet financing under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 140 net funds received from the sale of the accounts receivable totaled 210 million and 1747 million at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively and are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets 

page 27 of 97 

the company was not in default of any loan agreement at december 31 2005 and has met all payment obligations the us note agreements bank credit agreement and industrial development revenue bond agreements contain certain restrictions relating to dividends investments financial ratios guarantees and the incurrence of additional indebtedness 

additional details about the company’s receivables sales agreement and debt are available in notes 5 and 11 respectively accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report 

other liquidity items 

cash payments required for longterm debt maturities rental payments under noncancellable operating leases and purchasing obligations in effect at december 31 2005 are summarized in the following table 

 

 

 

contributions to the company’s defined benefit pension plans not including the unfunded german plans are expected to be 49 million in 2006 this estimate may change based on plan asset performance benefit payments related to these plans are expected to be 43 million 46 million 48 million 51 million and 54 million for the years ending december 31 2006 through 2010 respectively and 318 million thereafter payments to participants in the unfunded german plans are expected to be 22 million 22 million 23 million 24 million and 24 million for the years 2006 through 2010 respectively and a total of 131 million thereafter 

we increased our share repurchase program in 2005 to 3581 million net of issuances compared to 50 million net repurchases in 2004 on january 31 2005 in a privately negotiated stock repurchase transaction ball entered into a forward purchase agreement to repurchase 3 million of its common shares at an initial price of 4272 per share using cash on hand and available borrowings the price per share was subject to a price adjustment based on a weighted average price calculation for the period between the initial purchase date and the settlement date the company completed its purchase of the 3 million shares at an average price of 4163 per share and obtained delivery of the shares in early may 2005 

on october 26 2005 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 12 million shares of ball common stock this most recent repurchase authorization replaced the previous authorization of up to 12 million shares approved in july 2004 under which approximately 1 million shares remained at october 26 2005 

 

annual cash dividends paid on common stock were 40 cents per share in 2005 35 cents per share in 2004 and 24 cents per share in 2003 total dividends paid were 425 million in 2005 389 million in 2004 and 268 million in 2003

contingencies 

the company is subject to various risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of business due in part to the competitive nature of the industries in which we participate our operations in developing markets outside the us changing commodity prices for the materials used in the manufacture of our products and changing capital markets where practicable we attempt to reduce these risks and uncertainties through the establishment of risk management policies and procedures including at times the use of derivative financial instruments as explained in item 7a of this report 

from time to time the company is subject to routine litigation incident to its business additionally the us environmental protection agency has designated ball as a potentially responsible party along with numerous other companies for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites our information at this time does not indicate that these matters will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity results of operations or financial condition of the company 

due to political and legal uncertainties in germany no nationwide system for returning beverage containers was in place at the time a mandatory deposit was imposed in january 2003 and nearly all retailers stopped carrying beverages in nonrefillable containers during 2003 and 2004 we responded to the resulting lower demand for beverage cans by reducing production at our german plants implementing aggressive cost reduction measures and increasing exports from germany to other countries in the region served by ball packaging europe we also closed a plant in the united kingdom shut down a production line in germany delayed capital investment projects in france and poland and converted one of our steel can production lines in germany to aluminum in order to facilitate additional can exports from germany in 2004 the german parliament adopted a new packaging ordinance imposing a 25 eurocent deposit on all oneway glass pet and metal containers for water beer and carbonated soft drinks as of may 1 2006 all retailers must redeem all returned oneway containers as long as they sell such containers major retailers in germany have begun the process of implementing a returnable system for oneway containers since they along with fillers now appear to accept the deposit as permanent the retailers and the filling and packaging industries have formed a committee to design a nationwide recollection system and several retailers have begun to order reverse vending machines in order to meet the may 1 2006 deadline 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period future events could affect these estimates see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report for a summary of the company’s critical and significant accounting policies 

the us and european economies and the company have experienced minor general inflation during the past several years management believes that evaluation of ball’s performance during the periods covered by these consolidated financial statements should be based upon historical financial statements

tableend 

financial instruments and risk management 

in the ordinary course of business we employ established risk management policies and procedures to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices interest rates foreign currencies and prices of the company’s common stock in regard to common share repurchases although the instruments utilized involve varying degrees of credit market and interest risk the counterparties to the agreements are expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements 

we have estimated our market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis market risk exposure has been defined as the changes in fair value of derivative instruments financial instruments and commodity positions to test the sensitivity of our market risk exposure we have estimated the changes in fair value of market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in market prices or rates the results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized below 

commodity price risk 

we manage our commodity price risk in connection with market price fluctuations of aluminum primarily by entering into container sales contracts which generally include aluminumbased pricing terms that consider price fluctuations under our commercial supply contracts for aluminum purchases such terms generally include a fixed price or an upper limit to the aluminum component pricing this matched pricing affects most of our north american metal beverage container net sales we also at times use certain derivative instruments such as option and forward contracts as cash flow and fair value hedges of commodity price risk where there is not a passthrough arrangement in the sales contract 

our north american plastic container sales contracts include provisions to pass through resin cost changes as a result we believe we have minimal if any exposure related to changes in the cost of plastic resin most north american food container sales contracts either include provisions permitting us to pass through some or all steel cost changes we incur or incorporate annually negotiated steel costs in 2005 and 2004 we were able to pass through the majority of steel surcharges to our customers 

in europe and asia the company manages aluminum and steel raw material commodity price risks through annual and longterm contracts for the purchase of the materials as well as certain sales of containers that reduce the companys exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices within the current year these purchase and sales contracts include fixed price floating and passthrough pricing arrangements the company also uses forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges to minimize the company’s exposure to significant price changes for those sales contracts where there is not a passthrough arrangement 

considering the effects of derivative instruments the market’s ability to accept price increases and the company’s commodity price exposures a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the company’s metal prices could result in an estimated 52 million aftertax reduction of net earnings over a oneyear period additionally if foreign currency exchange rates were to change adversely by 10 percent we estimate there could be an 117 million aftertax reduction of net earnings over a oneyear period for foreign currency exposures on the metal actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates sensitivity to foreign currency exposures related to metal increased over prior years due to an increase in metal purchases and related payables at our foreign operations which are subject to foreign currency fluctuations 

the company is also exposed to fluctuations in prices for utilities such as natural gas and electricity a hypothetical 10 percent increase in our utility prices could result in an estimated 73 million aftertax reduction of net earnings over a oneyear period actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates 

page 31 of 97 

interest rate risk 

our objective in managing exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we use a variety of interest rate swaps and options to manage our mix of floating and fixedrate debt interest rate instruments held by the company at december 31 2005 and 2004 included payfixed and payfloating interest rate swaps payfixed swaps effectively convert variable rate obligations to fixed rate instruments the majority of the payfloating swaps which effectively convert fixedrate obligations to variable rate instruments are fair value hedges 

based on our interest rate exposure at december 31 2005 assumed floating rate debt levels throughout 2006 and the effects of derivative instruments a 100 basis point increase in interest rates could result in an estimated 52 million aftertax reduction of net earnings over a oneyear period actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates and the timing of these changes 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to protect foreign cash flows and earnings associated with foreign exchange rate changes through the use of cash flow hedges in addition we manage foreign earnings translation volatility through the use of foreign currency options our foreign currency translation risk results from the european euro british pound canadian dollar polish zloty chinese renminbi brazilian real and serbian dinar we face currency exposures in our global operations as a result of purchasing raw materials in us dollars and to a lesser extent in other currencies sales contracts are negotiated with customers to reflect cost changes and where there is not a foreign exchange passthrough arrangement the company uses forward and option contracts to manage foreign currency exposures 

considering the company’s derivative financial instruments outstanding at december 31 2005 and the currency exposures a hypothetical 10 percent reduction in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the us dollar could result in an estimated 194 million aftertax reduction of net earnings over a oneyear period this amount includes the 117 million currency exposure discussed above in the “commodity price risk” section this hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would also reduce our forecasted average debt balance by 63 million actual changes in market prices or rates may differ from hypothetical changes sensitivity to foreign currency exposures related to metal increased over prior years due to an increase in metal purchases and related payables at our foreign operations which are subject to foreign currency fluctuations

part iv 

 




 item 1 business ball corporation was organized in 1880 and incorporated in indiana in 1922 its principal executive offices are located at 10 longs peak drive broomfield colorado 800212510 the terms “ball” “the company” “we” and “our” as used herein refer to ball corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries 

ball is a manufacturer of metal and plastic packaging primarily for beverages and foods and a supplier of aerospace and other technologies and services to government and commercial customers 

information pertaining to the business of the company the company’s businesses are comprised of three segments 1 north american packaging 2 international packaging and 3 aerospace and technologies 

north american packaging our principal business in north america is the manufacture and sale of aluminum steel and polyethylene terephthalate pet containers primarily for beverages and foods this segment represented 65 percent of ball’s consolidated net sales in 2004 

a substantial part of our north american packaging sales are made directly to companies in packaged beverage and food businesses including sabmiller and bottlers of pepsicola and cocacola branded beverages and their affiliates that utilize consolidated purchasing groups sales to sabmiller plc and pepsico inc represented approximately 11 percent and 9 percent of ball’s consolidated net sales respectively for the year ended december 31 2004 additional details about sales to major customers are included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements which can be found in item 8 of this form 10k “financial statements and supplementary data” 

packaging products are sold in highly competitive markets primarily based on quality service and price the packaging business is capital intensive requiring significant investment in machinery and equipment profitability is sensitive to selling prices production volumes labor freight utility and warehousing costs as well as the availability and price of raw materials such as aluminum steel plastic resin and other direct materials these raw materials are generally available from several sources and we have secured what we consider to be adequate supplies and are not experiencing any shortages we believe we have limited our exposure related to changes in the costs of aluminum steel and plastic resin as a result of 1 the inclusion of provisions in most aluminum container sales contracts to pass through aluminum cost changes as well as the use of derivative instruments 2 the inclusion of provisions in certain steel container sales contracts to pass through steel cost changes and the existence of certain other steel container sales contracts that incorporate annually negotiated metal costs and 3 the inclusion of provisions in substantially all plastic container sales contracts to pass through resin cost changes in 2004 we were able to pass through steel surcharges levied by producers and we are currently in negotiations with respect to 2005 steel price increases we believe these negotiations will result in the pass through of the majority of the 2005 steel price increases at the same time we are attempting to reduce manufacturing and other material costs as much as possible while raw materials and energy sources such as natural gas and electricity may from time to time be in short supply or unavailable due to external factors and the pass through of steel costs to our customers may be limited in some instances we cannot predict the effects if any of such occurrences on future operations 

research and development rd efforts in the north american packaging segment are directed toward the development of new sizes and types of metal and plastic beverage and food containers as well as new uses for the current containers other research and development efforts in this segment generally seek to improve manufacturing efficiencies during 2004 we completed our expansion of the ball technology and innovation center located near denver colorado all of our north american rd activities are now conducted in that facility 

north american metal beverage containers 

north american metal beverage containers represent ball’s largest product line accounting for 67 percent of segment net sales and 44 percent of consolidated net sales in 2004 decorated twopiece aluminum beverage cans are produced at 16 manufacturing facilities in the us one facility in canada and one in puerto rico can ends are produced within four of the us facilities as well as in a fifth facility that manufactures only ends our annual production capacity is approximately 32 billion cans metal beverage containers are primarily sold under multiyear supply contracts to fillers of carbonated soft drinks beer and other beverages sales volumes of metal beverage containers in north america tend to be highest during the period from april through september 

through rocky mountain metal container llc a 5050 joint venture which is accounted for as an equity investment ball and coors brewing company coors a wholly owned subsidiary of molson coors brewing company participate in beverage can and end manufacturing facilities in golden colorado the joint venture supplies coors with beverage cans and ends for its golden colorado and memphis tennessee breweries and supplies ends to its shenandoah virginia filling location ball receives management fees and technology licensing fees under agreements with the joint venture in addition to beverage containers supplied to coors from the joint venture ball supplies from its own facilities substantially all of coors’ metal container requirements for its shenandoah virginia filling location as well as other containers not manufactured by the joint venture 

based on publicly available industry information we estimate that our north american metal beverage container shipments were approximately 31 percent of total us and canadian shipments for metal beverage containers three producers manufacture substantially all of the remaining metal beverage containers two of these producers and three other independent producers also manufacture metal beverage containers in mexico available information indicates that north american metal beverage container shipments have been relatively flat during the past several years 

beverage container production capacity in the us canada and mexico exceeds demand in order to more closely balance capacity and demand within our business from time to time we consolidate our can and end manufacturing capacity into fewer more efficient facilities from january 1 1999 through december 31 2001 we closed five plants in the second quarter of 2003 we closed a beverage end plant which we acquired from metal packaging international inc in march 2003 we also attempt to efficiently match capacity with the changes in customer demand for our packaging products to that end we are converting a beverage can manufacturing line in our golden colorado plant from the production of 12ounce beverage cans to 24ounce beverage cans the golden line conversion is expected to be completed during the second quarter of 2005 

the aluminum beverage container continues to compete aggressively with other packaging materials in the beer and soft drink industries the glass bottle has shown resilience in the packaged beer industry while soft drink industry use of pet containers has grown in canada metal beverage containers have captured significantly lower percentages of the packaged beverage industry than in the us particularly in the packaged beer industry 

north american metal food containers 

in addition to metal beverage containers ball produces twopiece and threepiece steel food containers for packaging vegetables fruit soups meat seafood nutritional products pet food and other products these containers are manufactured in 12 plants in the us and canada and sold primarily to food processors in north america in 2004 metal food container sales comprised approximately 22 percent of segment net sales and 14 percent of consolidated net sales sales volumes of metal food containers in north america tend to be highest from june through october as a result of seasonal vegetable and salmon packs approximately 33 billion steel food containers were shipped in the us and canada in 2004 approximately 21 percent of which we estimate were shipped by ball 

on march 17 2004 ball acquired conagra grocery products company’s conagra interest in ball western can company llc ball western can located in oakdale california prior to the acquisition ball western can was a 5050 joint venture between ball and conagra and was accounted for under the equity method of accounting the acquisition of ball western can added approximately one billion units of annual capacity 

competitors in the metal food container business include two national and a few regional suppliers and self manufacturers several producers in mexico also manufacture steel food containers steel food containers also compete with other packaging materials in the food industry including glass aluminum plastic paper and the standup pouch as a result demand for this product line may be affected during the next few years and this segment must increasingly focus on product innovation and cost reduction service quality and price are among the key competitive factors 

north american plastic containers 

pet containers represented approximately 11 percent of segment net sales and 7 percent of consolidated net sales in 2004 demand for containers made of pet has increased in the beverage and food markets with improved barrier technologies and other advances this growth in demand should continue assuming adequate supplies of resin continue to be available while pet beverage containers compete against metal glass and paper the historical increase in the sales of pet containers has come primarily at the expense of glass containers and through new market introductions we estimate our 2004 shipments of 5 billion plastic containers to be approximately 8 percent of total us and canadian plastic container shipments 

the company operates five pet facilities in the us competition in the pet container industry includes several national and regional suppliers and selfmanufacturers service quality and price are important competitive factors the ability to produce customized differentiated plastic containers is becoming a key competitive factor 

most of ball’s pet containers are sold under longterm contracts to suppliers of bottled water and carbonated soft drinks including bottlers of pepsicola branded beverages and their affiliates that utilize consolidated purchasing groups our plastic beer containers are being tested by several of our customers and we are developing plastic containers for the single serve juice market we have expanded our line of heattektm pet plastic bottles for hotfilled beverages adding sizes from 8 ounces to 64 ounces 

international packaging europe 

ball packaging europe’s operations which accounted for 20 percent of ball’s consolidated net sales in 2004 consist of nine beverage can plants and two aluminum beverage can end plants a technical center in bonn germany and the european headquarters in ratingen germany of the 11 plants four are located in germany three in the united kingdom two in france and one each in the netherlands and poland in total the plants produced approximately 11 billion cans in 2004 with approximately half of those being produced from steel and half from aluminum four of the can plants use steel only four use aluminum and one plant uses both metals 

ball packaging europe is the second largest metal beverage container producer in europe with an approximate 30 percent of european shipments and produces twopiece beverage cans and can ends for producers of beer carbonated soft drinks mineral water fruit juices energy drinks isotonics milkbased beverages coffee drinks and alcoholic mixed drinks in western europe ball packaging europe is the top metal beverage container manufacturer in germany france and the benelux countries and the second largest metal beverage container manufacturer in the united kingdom in addition it has contributed to the development of the eastern european beverage business and is the second largest metal beverage container manufacturer in poland in 2004 ball began construction on a new aluminum beverage can manufacturing plant in belgrade serbia to serve the growing demand for beverage cans in southern and eastern europe this plant is expected to commence production in the second quarter of 2005 

as in north america the metal beverage container continues to compete aggressively with other packaging materials used by the european beer and soft drink industries the glass bottle is heavily utilized in the packaged beer industry while the pet container is increasingly utilized in the soft drink juice and mineral water industries 

our european beverage container business has a balanced and stable customer base with 10 customers accounting for approximately 65 percent of its net sales ball packaging europe’s major customers include cocacola inbev molson coors heineken bavaria sabmiller britvic and diageo guinness 

beverage packaging in germany is subject to a mandatory deposit fee on cans and other nonrefillable containers due to political and legal uncertainties surrounding the mandatory deposit in germany no nationwide system for returning the containers was in place when the deposit was imposed on january 1 2003 as a result nearly all retailers stopped carrying beverages in nonrefillable containers subsequently several small return systems have been put in place instead of one generally accepted return system and no broad solution has been put forth on october 15 2004 the german parliament adopted a proposal leaving the existing deposit of 25 eurocents per container in effect this decision however was ruled not in compliance with the european union eu law and therefore does not provide a stable legal situation to which the industry can adapt the outcome of the legal proceedings of the eu commission is unclear and the political discussions about the deposit continue we have responded by reducing beverage can production at our german plants implementing aggressive cost reduction measures and increasing exports from germany to other european countries 

the european beverage can business is capital intensive requiring significant investments in machinery and equipment profitability is sensitive to selling prices foreign exchange rates production volumes labor and the costs and availability of certain raw materials such as aluminum and steel the european aluminum and steel industries are highly consolidated with three steel suppliers and three aluminum suppliers providing 95 percent of european requirements material supply contracts are generally for a period of one year although ball packaging europe has negotiated some longer term agreements aluminum is purchased primarily in us dollars while the functional currencies of ball packaging europe and its subsidiaries are nonus dollars this inherently results in a foreign exchange rate risk which the company minimizes through the use of derivative contracts 

rd efforts in europe are directed toward the development of new sizes and types of metal containers as well as new uses for the current containers other research and development efforts in this segment include improving manufacturing efficiencies the european rd activities are conducted in a technical center located in bonn germany 

other international 

through ball asia pacific limited we are one of the largest beverage can manufacturers in the people’s republic of china prc and believe that our facilities are among the most modern in that country capacity grew rapidly in the prc resulting in a supplydemand imbalance to which we have responded in recent years by closing facilities our current operations include the manufacture of aluminum cans and ends in three plants and highdensity plastic containers in two plants sales in the prc represented 3 percent of consolidated net sales we also participate in joint ventures that manufacture aluminum cans and ends in brazil and in the prc in the fourth quarter of 2004 we recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts in respect of a receivable of a 35percent owned joint venture in the prc

aerospace and technologies the aerospace and technologies segment includes defense operations civil space systems and commercial space operations the defense operations business unit includes defense systems systems engineering services advanced antenna and video systems and electrooptics and cryogenic systems and components sales in the aerospace and technologies segment accounted for approximately 12 percent of consolidated net sales in 2004 

the majority of the aerospace and technologies segment business involves work under contracts generally from one to five years in duration as a prime contractor or subcontractor for the national aeronautics and space administration nasa the us department of defense dod and other us government agencies contracts funded by the various agencies of the federal government represented approximately 82 percent and 96 percent of segment sales in 2004 and 2003 respectively the percentage representing us government sales decreased in 2004 due to growing revenues related to the worldview contract geopolitical events and executive and legislative branch priorities have yielded considerable growth opportunities in areas matching our core capabilities however consolidation in the aerospace and defense industries continues and there is strong competition for new business 

civil space systems defense systems and commercial space operations include hardware software and services sold primarily to us customers with emphasis on space science and exploration environmental and earth sciences and defense and intelligence applications major contractual activities frequently involve the design manufacture and testing of satellites remote sensors and ground station control hardware and software as well as related services such as launch vehicle integration and satellite operations 

other hardware activities include target identification warning and attitude control systems and components cryogenic systems for reactant storage and sensor cooling devices using either closedcycle mechanical refrigerators or opencycle solid and liquid cryogens star trackers which are generalpurpose stellar attitude sensors and faststeering mirrors additionally the aerospace and technologies segment provides diversified technical services and products to government agencies prime contractors and commercial organizations for a broad range of information warfare electronic warfare avionics intelligence training and space systems needs 

backlog in the aerospace and technologies segment was 694 million and 644 million at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively and consists of the aggregate contract value of firm orders excluding amounts previously recognized as revenue the 2004 backlog includes 502 million expected to be recognized in revenues during 2005 with the remainder expected to be recognized in revenues thereafter unfunded amounts included in backlog for certain firm government orders which are subject to annual funding were 393 million and 443 million at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively yeartoyear comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations 

the company’s aerospace and technologies segment has contracts with the us government or its contractors which have standard termination provisions the government retains the right to terminate contracts at its convenience however if contracts are terminated in this manner ball is entitled to reimbursement for allowable costs and profits on authorized work performed through the date of termination us government contracts are also subject to reduction or modification in the event of changes in government requirements or budgetary constraints 

patents in the opinion of the company none of its active patents is essential to the successful operation of its business as a whole 

research and development note 18 “research and development” in the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report contains information on company research and development activity additional information is also included in item 2 “properties” below 

environment aluminum steel and pet containers are recyclable and significant amounts of used containers are being diverted from the solid waste stream and recycled using the most recent data available in 2003 approximately 50 percent of aluminum containers 60 percent of steel containers and 20 percent of the pet containers sold in the us were recycled 

recycling rates vary throughout europe but generally average 60 percent for aluminum and steel containers which exceeds the european union’s goal of 50 percent recycling for metals due in part to the intrinsic value of aluminum and steel metal packaging compares favorably to other packaging materials in terms of recycling in europe some of the highest rates are in germany where both aluminum and steel containers were recycled at rates estimated to be at least 80 percent prior to the imposition of mandatory deposits on oneway packaging effective january 1 2003 

compliance with federal state and local laws relating to protection of the environment has not had a material adverse effect upon the capital expenditures earnings or competitive position of the company as more fully described under item 3 legal proceedings the us environmental protection agency and various state environmental agencies have designated the company as a potentially responsible party along with numerous other companies for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites however the company’s information at this time indicates that these matters will not have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity results of operations or financial condition of the company 

legislation which would prohibit tax or restrict the sale or use of certain types of containers and would require diversion of solid wastes such as packaging materials from disposal in landfills has been or may be introduced anywhere we operate while container legislation has been adopted in some jurisdictions similar legislation has been defeated in public referenda and legislative bodies in numerous others the company anticipates that continuing efforts will be made to consider and adopt such legislation in many jurisdictions in the future if such legislation were widely adopted it potentially could have a material adverse effect on the business of the company as well as on the container manufacturing industry generally in view of the company’s substantial global sales and investment in metal and pet container manufacturing however the packages we produce are widely used and perform well in us states and canadian provinces that have deposit systems 

employees at the end of december 2004 the company employed approximately 13200 people worldwide including 9100 employees in the us and 4100 in other countries there are also approximately 1000 employees employed in unconsolidated joint ventures in which ball participates approximately onethird of balls north american packaging plant employees are unionized and most of our european plant employees are union workers collective bargaining agreements with various unions in the us have terms of three to five years expire at regular intervals and are customarily renewed in the ordinary course after bargaining between union and company representatives the company believes that its employee relations are good and that its training education and retention practices assist in enhancing employee satisfaction levels

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ball corporation and subsidiaries are referred to collectively as “ball” “the company” “we” and “our” in the following discussion and analysis 

management’s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 

business overview ball corporation is one of the world’s leading suppliers of metal and plastic packaging to the beverage and food industries our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses and are currently manufactured in 48 plants around the world we also supply aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers 

we sell our packaging products primarily to major beverage and food producers with which we have developed longterm customer relationships this is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of longterm supply contracts while we have diversified our customer base we do sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major beverage and food companies in north america europe and the people’s republic of china prc as does our equity joint venture in brazil we also purchase raw materials from relatively few suppliers because of our customer and supplier concentration our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss of a major customer or supplier or a change in a supply agreement with a major supplier or customer although our longterm relationships and contracts mitigate these risks 

in the rigid packaging industry in the us and canada sales and earnings can be improved by reducing costs developing new products volume expansion and increasing pricing where possible while the us and canadian beverage container manufacturing industry is relatively mature the european prc and brazilian beverage can markets are growing excluding the effects of the german mandatory deposit discussed in “international packaging” and are expected to continue to grow we are capitalizing on this growth by reconfiguring some of our european can manufacturing lines building a beverage can manufacturing plant near belgrade serbia and expanding our manufacturing capacity in both the prc and brazil the belgrade plant is scheduled to be operational by the second quarter of 2005 

with our acquisition of ball packaging europe in december 2002 ball’s consolidated earnings are more exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations we attempt to mitigate this exposure through the use of derivative financial instruments as discussed in the “financial instruments and risk management” section 

as part of our packaging strategy we are focused on developing and marketing new and existing products that meet the everexpanding needs of our beverage and food customers these innovations include new shapes sizes opening features and other functional benefits of both metal and plastic packaging this packaging development activity helps us maintain and expand our supply positions with major beverage and food customers 

the primary customers for the products and services provided by our aerospace and technologies segment are us government agencies or their prime contractors it is possible that congressional budget reductions or changes in agency budgets could limit future funding and new contract awards 

we recognize sales under longterm contracts in the aerospace and technologies segment using the costtocost percentage of completion method of accounting our present contract mix consists of approximately 60 percent costplus contracts which are billed at our costs plus an agreed upon profit component and approximately 40 percent fixed price contracts we include time and material contracts in the fixed price category because such contracts typically provide for the sale of engineering labor at fixed hourly rates throughout the period of contract performance we regularly reevaluate and if necessary revise our estimates of total contract revenue total contract cost and progress toward completion because of contract payment schedules limitations on funding and other contract terms our sales and accounts receivable for this business include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed 

management uses various measures to evaluate company performance the primary financial measures we use are earnings before interest and taxes ebit diluted earnings per share economic value added operating cash flow and free cash flow generally defined by the company as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures nonfinancial measures in the packaging segments include production spoilage rates quality control measures and production and shipment volumes additional measures used to evaluate performance in the aerospace and technologies segment include contract revenue realization award and incentive fees realized proposal win rates and backlog including awarded contracted and funded backlog 

we recognize that attracting and retaining quality employees is critically important to the success of ball and because of this we work to pay employees competitively and encourage their prudent ownership of the company’s common stock for most management employees a meaningful portion of compensation is at risk as an incentive dependent upon economic valueadded operating performance for more senior positions more compensation is at risk through our employee stock purchase plan and 401k plan which matches employee contributions with ball common stock many employees regardless of organizational level have opportunities to participate as ball shareholders during 2004 we expanded our employee stock purchase program to some of our ball packaging europe employees 

in recognition of the company’s performance the company’s board of directors declared a twoforone stock split and increased the quarterly dividend the distribution date for the stock split was august 23 2004 for shareholders of record on august 4 2004 as a result of the stock split all amounts related to earnings per share and share prices have been retroactively restated as if the split had occurred as of january 1 2002 ball’s board also authorized the repurchase of up to 12 million of the company’s postsplit shares this authorization replaced all previous authorizations on january 31 2005 the company repurchased 3 million shares thereby reducing the maximum number of shares that may yet be repurchased by that amount 

consolidated sales and earnings ball’s operations are organized along its product lines and include three segments – north american packaging international packaging and aerospace and technologies we also have investments in companies in the us the prc and brazil which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and accordingly those results are not included in segment sales or earnings 

north american packaging 

north american packaging consists of operations located in the us and canada which manufacture metal container products used primarily in beverage and food packaging and polyethylene terephthalate pet plastic container products used principally in beverage packaging this segment accounted for 65 percent of consolidated net sales in 2004 

metal beverage container sales 

north american metal beverage container sales comprised 67 percent of segment sales in 2004 69 percent in 2003 and were 3 percent higher than in 2003 contributing to the increase were the pass through of aluminum price increases and higher volumes in our specialty can products partially offset by declines in standard 12ounce cans sales in the first quarter of 2004 were also improved over 2003 due to the acquisition of metal packaging international inc mpi in march 2003 discussed below north american metal beverage container sales were slightly higher in 2003 than in 2002 as higher can end volumes resulting from the acquisition of mpi were partially offset by lower can and end volumes in several regions of the country due to poor weather conditions based on publicly available information we estimate that our shipments of metal beverage containers were approximately 31 percent of total us and canadian shipments in 2004 

in october 2004 we announced plans to convert a beverage can manufacturing line in our golden colorado plant from the production of 12ounce beverage cans to 24ounce beverage cans the golden line conversion which is expected to be completed during the second quarter of 2005 will enable ball to more efficiently match its capacity with the growing demand for custom cans 

on march 11 2003 we acquired mpi a manufacturer of aluminum beverage can ends for 28 million mpi produced just over 2 billion ends for metal beverage containers per year primarily for soft drink companies and had sales of approximately 42 million in 2002 

metal food container sales 

metal food container sales in 2004 comprised 22 percent of segment sales 20 percent in 2003 and were 20 percent higher than 2003 sales sales were higher due to the acquisition of ball western can company llc ball western can in march 2004 discussed below higher selling prices as a result of the pass through of raw material costs and some prebuying by customers in the fourth quarter ahead of expected steel price increases negotiations with respect to 2005 sales contracts are ongoing we believe these negotiations will result in the pass through of the majority of the 2005 steel price increases we estimate our 2004 shipments of approximately 7 billion cans to be approximately 21 percent of total us and canadian metal food container shipments based on publicly available trade information 

metal food container sales in 2003 were 3 percent higher than in 2002 sales were higher in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily as a result of a multiyear contract with ross products a division of abbott laboratories 

on march 17 2004 we acquired conagra grocery products company’s conagra interest in ball western can for 30 million ball western can located in oakdale california was established in 2000 as a 5050 joint venture between ball and conagra and prior to the acquisition was accounted for by ball using the equity method of accounting ball and conagra’s parent company conagra foods inc signed a longterm agreement under which ball will provide metal food containers to conagra food packing locations in california the acquisition of ball western can added approximately one billion units of annual capacity 

plastic container sales 

plastic container sales in 2004 comprised 11 percent of segment sales 11 percent in 2003 and increased 7 percent compared to 2003 the increase was primarily related to several new preform sales contracts secured during the year and the price pass through of raw material price increases preform sales which represent approximately 8 percent of the business increased by 56 percent and bottle sales increased by 4 percent over 2003 levels carbonated soft drink and water sales volumes were lower than expected primarily due to reduced demand on the east coast resulting from competitive pressures and a delay in the commencement of a new customer supply opportunity on the west coast although only a small percentage of our total volume juice and beer container sales increased in 2004 and are expected to grow considerably in the future as more focus is given to these specialty markets and the development of our heattektm business we estimate our 2004 shipments of 5 billion bottles to be approximately 8 percent of total us and canadian plastic container shipments 

plastic container sales in 2003 increased 6 percent compared to 2002 four plastic bottle blowmolding production lines were installed during the latter part of 2002 which increased 2003 sales volumes compared to 2002 competitive pricing pressure and cold and wet weather conditions on the east coast and in the midwest contributed to lower than expected 2003 sales in response to the lower sales we reduced production at certain plants and reduced the work force and idled some of the equipment at our watertown wisconsin plant 

north american packaging segment earnings 

segment earnings in 2004 were 18 percent higher than in 2003 the improvement in earnings was the result of higher sales and production volumes improved product mix cost reduction programs and strong fourth quarter food can sales in addition 2003 earnings were negatively impacted by approximately 11 million of startup costs associated with a new twopiece food can manufacturing line in milwaukee partially offsetting these 2004 earnings improvements were continued pricing pressures on commodity plastic containers for soft drink customers and an increase in cost of sales due to rising raw material costs under the lifo lastinfirstout method of accounting 

segment earnings were slightly lower in 2003 than in 2002 in addition to the milwaukee startup costs 2003 earnings were negatively affected by competitive pricing pressures on food cans and plastic containers these issues were partially offset by cost improvements achieved through operating efficiencies lower spoilage and stringent cost management particularly in our metal beverage container plants 

segment earnings results over the past three years include various business consolidation activities which were undertaken to improve our operations all of these restructuring activities were completed by the end of 2004 segment earnings included business consolidation gains of 11 million and 02 million for 2004 and 2003 respectively and a loss of 23 million in 2002 in addition to the business consolidation gains relocation costs of 2 million and 27 million were incurred in 2004 and 2003 respectively for the relocation of the plastics offices and research and development facility from atlanta georgia to colorado the office relocation was completed during 2003 and the rd facility relocation was completed in 2004 

concerning the business consolidation activities earnings of 04 million were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004 as costs to complete the closure of a metal food container plant were less than expected also in the third quarter 07 million of earnings were recorded to reflect lower than expected costs incurred on the shut down and relocation of the atlanta plastics offices and research and development facility 

in the fourth quarter of 2003 a gain of 16 million was recorded in connection with the sale of a metal beverage container facility that was shut down in december 2001 in the first quarter of 2003 a net charge of 14 million was booked to record the closure of a metal food container plant and a gain from a previous plant closure 

in the fourth quarter of 2002 a net charge of 23 million was recorded in connection with the closure of the atlanta plastics facilities and the completion of several plant closures commenced prior to 2002 

international packaging 

international packaging includes the production and sale of metal beverage container products manufactured in europe and asia as well as plastic containers manufactured and sold in asia this segment accounted for 23 percent of consolidated net sales in 2004 

europe 

ball packaging europe which represents approximately 30 percent of the total european metal beverage container manufacturing capacity has manufacturing plants located in germany the united kingdom france the netherlands and poland european sales were 10 percent higher in 2004 than in 2003 as a result of a stronger euro higher selling prices and successful export programs from german plants to other european countries in the first quarter of 2003 one german can manufacturing line was idled and in the first quarter of 2004 another german can manufacturing line was converted from steel to aluminum cans another steel can manufacturing line in the netherlands is being converted to aluminum partially in response to increased demand for custom cans in europe this conversion is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2005 

european sales of 1 billion in 2003 benefited from a strong euro but were negatively affected by the january 1 2003 imposition of a mandatory deposit on oneway metal pet and glass beverage containers for beer carbonated soft drinks and water in germany where four of ball packaging europe’s plants are located while sales volumes to german customers from our european plants were down approximately 22 billion cans in 2003 from prior year levels warm weather conditions in much of europe and the continued growth in beverage can usage in eastern and southern europe have helped to increase volumes in other countries sales in 2002 were not comparable to 2003 because ball acquired ball packaging europe on december 19 2002 

construction on a new beverage can plant near belgrade serbia commenced during the second quarter of 2004 to serve the growing demand for beverage cans in southern and eastern europe we currently expect the new plant to be operational in the second quarter of 2005 

prc 

sales in the prc in 2004 increased 18 percent over 2003 levels which were flat compared to 2002 earnings before taxes were significantly improved over the prior year due largely to cost reduction initiatives resulting from business consolidation actions taken in 2001 

during the fourth quarter of 2004 sanshui jianlibao ftb packaging limited sanshui jfp a 35 percent owned prc joint venture experienced a greater than customary seasonal production slowdown caused by cash flow difficulties the cash flow difficulties were due to a build up of receivables from our joint venture partner’s business which is sanshui jfp’s major customer after discussions with representatives of the local chinese government which has taken control of our joint venture partner’s business we recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts in respect of sanshui jfp’s receivable from the joint venture partner our share of the bad debt provision amounted to 152 million and is included in the consolidated statement of earnings as equity in results of affiliates 

international packaging segment earnings 

international packaging segment earnings improved in 2004 and 2003 due to a stronger euro and higher profit margins in both europe and the prc due in large part to operational cost reduction programs the stronger euro improved our net earnings per diluted share by 008 in 2004 compared to 2003 segment earnings in 2004 were also improved over 2003 by the nonrecurrence of purchase accounting adjustments which increased ball packaging europe’s cost of sales in 2003 

in june 2001 we announced a plan to exit the general line metal can business in the prc and reduce our prc beverage can manufacturing capacity by closing two plants a 2377 million pretax charge 185 million after tax and minority interest impact was recorded in connection with this reorganization we recorded 137 million of earnings during 2004 33 million in 2003 and 51 million in 2002 as restructuring activities were completed resulting in realization on assets in excess of amounts previously estimated as well as costs incurred being less than estimated other than tax clearances from the applicable authorities as the closed facilities are formally liquidated the costs and transactions related to the prc were concluded by the end of 2004 

aerospace and technologies 

aerospace and technologies segment sales represented 12 percent of 2004 consolidated net sales 11 percent in 2003 and were 22 percent higher than in 2003 higher sales in 2004 resulted from newly awarded contracts and additions to previously awarded contracts the aerospace and technologies business won a number of large strategic contracts and delivered a great deal of sophisticated space and defense instrumentation throughout the period net earnings decreased in 2004 by 2 percent compared to 2003 largely due to increased pension costs and higher costs incurred on certain costplus contracts without corresponding additional fees as these contracts reach completion in addition 2003 margins included approximately 8 million due to successfully achieving milestones in two key programs sales and operating margins in 2003 increased compared to 2002 as a result of strong operating performance and the program milestones and completions mentioned above 

some of the segment’s highprofile contracts include the deep impact mission which was launched in january 2005 to intercept and study a comet worldview an advanced commercial remote sensing satellite the james webb space telescope a successor to the hubble space telescope the spacebased space surveillance system which will detect and track space objects such as satellites and orbital debris npoess the nextgeneration satellite weather monitoring system and a number of antennas for the joint strike fighter 

earnings were recorded of 04 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 02 million in the third quarter of 2003 and 2 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 for exit costs that were no longer required due to the sale of a product line whose operations ceased in 2001 in the fourth quarter of 2002 we also recorded a 25 million aftertax charge to write off an equity investment in an aerospace company 

sales to the us government either directly as a prime contractor or indirectly as a subcontractor represented approximately 82 percent of segment sales in 2004 and 96 percent of segment sales in both 2003 and 2002 the percentage representing us government sales decreased in 2004 due to growing revenues related to the worldview contract contracted backlog for the aerospace and technologies segment at december 31 2004 and 2003 was 694 million and 644 million respectively yeartoyear comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations 

for additional information regarding the company’s segments see the summary of business segment information in note 2 accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report the charges recorded for business consolidation activities were based on estimates by ball management actuaries and other independent parties and were developed from information available at the time if actual outcomes vary from the estimates the differences will be reflected in current period earnings in the consolidated statement of earnings and identified as business consolidation gains and losses additional details about our business consolidation activities and associated costs are provided in note 4 accompanying the consolidated financial statements 

selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses were 2679 million 2342 million and 1706 million for 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the increase in 2004 compared to 2003 was due to higher costs related to the company’s deposit share program higher pension and incentive costs costs associated with sarbanesoxley compliance in 2004 higher research and development costs the effects of foreign exchange rates and growth in our aerospace and technologies segment in 2004 we reduced our us pension plan discount rate from 675 percent to 625 percent resulting in approximately 83 million higher us pension expense for the year compared to 2003 most of which was included in cost of sales 

approximately 481 million of the increase in 2003 compared to 2002 is related to the acquisition of ball packaging europe in december 2002 the additional increase in 2003 was primarily the result of higher employee costs incentives and higher pension expense partially offset by lower expenses in the prc in 2003 we reduced our us pension plan longterm asset return assumption from 9 percent to 85 percent and our discount rate from 75 percent to 675 percent the changes in the return on pension asset and discount rate assumptions as well as actual asset performance increased north american pension expense for the year by approximately 148 million as compared to 2002 most of this increase was included in cost of sales 

for the us pension plans we intend to maintain our current return on asset assumption at 85 percent for 2005 while further reducing the discount rate assumption to 6 percent based on these assumptions us pension expense for 2005 is anticipated to increase approximately 54 million compared to 2004 most of which will be included in cost of sales pension expense in europe and canada combined is expected to be comparable to 2004 expense a further reduction of the plan asset return assumption by one quarter of a percentage point would result in additional expense of approximately 18 million a quarter of a percentage point reduction in the discount rate would result in approximately 33 million of additional expense additional information regarding the company’s pension plans is provided in note 13 accompanying the consolidated financial statements 

interest and taxes consolidated interest expense before debt refinancing costs was 1037 million in 2004 1259 million in 2003 and 756 million in 2002 the lower expense in 2004 compared to 2003 was due to lower average borrowings and changes in interest rates the higher expense in 2003 compared to 2002 was associated with the higher level of borrowings subsequent to the acquisition of ball packaging europe debt refinancing costs in 2003 included 152 million of costs associated with the early redemption of the company’s 825 senior subordinated notes in august 2003 debt refinancing costs in 2002 included 52 million related to the refinancing of the company’s debt in connection with the acquisition of ball packaging europe 

ball’s consolidated effective income tax rate for 2004 was 32 percent compared to 313 percent in 2003 and 356 percent in 2002 the overall 2004 effective rate was slightly higher primarily due to higher north american earnings than in 2003 but continues to reflect a low consolidated european income tax rate due to lower profits in germany reflecting the impact of the refundable mandatory deposit on nonrefillable containers imposed on january 1 2003 and a tax holiday in poland germany has the highest tax rate of the european countries in which ball has operations 

we are currently reviewing the impact of making a 2005 foreign earnings distribution to the us via intercompany dividend distributions in accordance with the american jobs creation act of 2004 if such a dividend distribution were to occur we estimate the reasonably possible range of distributions to be 300 million to 500 million with the related potential impact on income tax expense being 7 million to 12 million see note 12 in item 8 for more details on other pending tax matters 

results of equity affiliates equity in the earnings of affiliates is attributable to our 50 percent ownership in packaging investments in north america and brazil a minorityowned aerospace business and our minorityowned packaging investments in the prc and prior to 2003 in thailand earnings in 2004 included a 152 million loss which represented ball’s share of a provision for doubtful accounts related to its 35 percent owned interest in sanshui jfp discussed above in “international packaging” excluding the prc loss earnings were 158 million in 2004 compared to 113 million in 2003 and 93 million in 2002 the higher earnings in 2004 included improved results in our joint ventures in brazil and north america the higher earnings in 2003 compared to 2002 were the result of improved earnings in our joint venture in brazil offset by lower earnings in our north american packaging joint ventures and our investment in thailand no longer being accounted for under the equity method 

new accounting pronouncements for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources cash flows and capital expenditures cash flows from operating activities were 5359 million in 2004 compared to 364 million in 2003 and 4523 million in 2002 the lower amount generated in 2003 included 1383 million for the payment in january 2003 of an accrued withholding tax obligation related to the acquisition of ball packaging europe further discussed below which was funded by the seller at the time of closing by the inclusion of €131 million of additional cash 

management internally uses a free cash flow measure 1 to evaluate the company’s operating results 2 for planning purposes 3 to evaluate strategic investments and 4 to evaluate the company’s ability to incur and service debt free cash flow is not a defined term under us generally accepted accounting principles and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures the company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less additions to property plant and equipment capital spending free cash flow is typically derived directly from the company’s cash flow statements however it may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods an example of such an item excluded in 2003 is the 1383 million withholding tax payment liability assumed in the acquisition of ball packaging europe in december 2002 discussed above we believe this is not a comparable free cash flow outflow of the company as it was funded by the seller 

based on this our consolidated free cash flow is summarized as follows 

 cash flows from operating activities in 2004 reflected higher earnings and higher accounts payable offset by higher accounts receivable and inventories inventories and accounts payable were higher due to increased purchases of raw materials and accounts receivable were higher partially as a result of strong december food can sales cash flow in 2003 included higher earnings lower accounts receivable and lower inventories than in 2002 but was offset by lower accounts payable 

based on information currently available we estimate cash flows from operating activities for 2005 to be 500 million or more capital spending to be approximately 300 million and free cash flow to exceed 200 million capital spending of 196 million in 2004 was below depreciation and amortization expense of 2151 million in 2005 we plan to invest capital in our highest performing operations including projects to increase custom can capabilities convert lines from steel to aluminum in europe and the completion of a new beverage can manufacturing plant in belgrade serbia as well as expenditures in the aerospace and technologies segment 

debt facilities and refinancing 

interestbearing debt at december 31 2004 decreased 262 million to 16607 million from 16869 million at yearend 2003 the reduction in interestbearing debt includes the net repayment of approximately 78 million of debt partially offset by the noncash translation exchange effect on the balance sheet of having foreign debt denominated in the stronger euro and british pound cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2004 were 1987 million compared to 365 million at december 31 2003 we intend to use much of the 2004 ending cash balance to repurchase shares of our stock 

at december 31 2004 approximately 407 million was available under the revolving credit facility portions of the multicurrency senior credit facilities the company also had 234 million of shortterm uncommitted credit facilities available at the end of the year of which 437 million was outstanding

on august 8 2003 ball refinanced 825 senior subordinated notes due in 2008 through the private placement of 250 million of 6875 senior notes due in 2012 issued at a price of 102 effective yield to maturity of 658 percent in connection with the refinancing of the higher interest debt in the third quarter of 2003 a pretax charge of 152 million was recorded as interest expense which consisted of the payment of a 103 million call premium and the write off of 49 million of unamortized financing costs 

in connection with the acquisition of ball packaging europe we refinanced 389 million of our existing debt and as a result recorded in 2002 a pretax charge of 52 million for the write off of unamortized financing costs 

the company has a receivables sales agreement which provides for the ongoing revolving sale of a designated pool of trade accounts receivable of ball’s north american packaging operations up to 200 million as of december 31 2004 175 million as of december 31 2003 the agreement qualifies as offbalance sheet financing under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 140 net funds received from the sale of the accounts receivable totaled 1747 million and 175 million at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively and are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets 

the company was not in default of any loan agreement at december 31 2004 and has met all payment obligations the us note agreements bank credit agreement and industrial development revenue bond agreements contain certain restrictions relating to dividends investments financial ratios guarantees and the incurrence of additional indebtedness

other liquidity items cash payments required for debt maturities rental payments under noncancellable operating leases and purchasing obligations in effect at december 31 2004 are summarized in the following table 

  contributions to the company’s defined benefit pension plans not including the unfunded german plans are expected to be approximately 17 million in 2005 this estimate may change based on plan asset performance benefit payments related to these plans are expected to be 43 million 44 million 47 million 49 million and 51 million for the years ending december 31 2005 through 2009 respectively and 301 million thereafter payments to participants in the unfunded german plans are expected to be approximately 24 million in 2005 25 million in each of the years 2006 through 2009 and a total of 123 million thereafter 

we have increased our share repurchase program in 2005 to between 150 million and 175 million net of issuances compared to 50 million net in 2004 on january 31 2005 ball repurchased 3 million of its common shares at an initial price of 4272 per share using cash on hand and available borrowings the price per share is subject to a price adjustment based on a weighted average price calculation for the period between the initial purchase date and the settlement date of july 6 2005 

annual cash dividends paid on common stock were 35 cents per share in 2004 24 cents per share in 2003 and 18 cents per share in 2002 ball increased its dividends for the third and fourth quarter of 2004 from seven and a half to 10 cents per share resulting in dividend payments which were 121 million higher in 2004 than in 2003 the company also increased its dividends for the third and fourth quarters of 2003 from four and a half to seven and a half cents per share this change resulted in dividend payments which were 64 million higher in 2003 than in 2002 

contingencies the company is subject to various risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of business due in part to the competitive nature of the industries in which we participate our operations in developing markets outside the us changing commodity prices for the materials used in the manufacture of our products and changing capital markets where practicable we attempt to reduce these risks and uncertainties through the establishment of risk management policies and procedures including at times the use of derivative financial instruments as explained in item 7a of this report 

from time to time the company is subject to routine litigation incident to its business additionally the us environmental protection agency has designated ball as a potentially responsible party along with numerous other companies for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites our information at this time does not indicate that these matters will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity results of operations or financial condition of the company 

due to political and legal uncertainties in germany no nationwide system for returning containers was in place at the time a mandatory deposit was imposed in january 2003 and most retailers stopped carrying beverages in nonrefillable containers on october 15 2004 the german parliament adopted a proposal leaving the existing deposit of 25 eurocents per container in effect this decision however was ruled not in compliance with the european union eu law and therefore does not provide a stable legal situation to which the industry can adapt the outcome of the legal proceedings of the eu commission is unclear and the political discussions about the deposit continue we have responded by reducing beverage can production at our german plants implementing aggressive cost reduction measures and increasing exports from germany to other european countries we also closed a plant in the united kingdom shut down one production line in germany delayed capital investment projects in france and poland and have converted one of our steel can production lines in germany to aluminum in order to facilitate additional can exports from germany 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period future events could affect these estimates see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the company’s critical and significant accounting policies 

the us economy and the company have experienced minor general inflation during the past several years management believes that evaluation of ball’s performance during the periods covered by these consolidated financial statements should be based upon historical financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments and risk management in the ordinary course of business we employ risk management policies and procedures to reduce our exposure to commodity price changes changes in interest rates fluctuations in foreign currencies and fluctuations in prices of the company’s common stock in regard to common share repurchases although the instruments utilized involve varying degrees of credit and interest risk the counter parties to the agreements are financial institutions which are expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements 

to test the sensitivity of our market risk exposure we have estimated the changes in fair value of market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in market prices or rates the results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized below actual changes in market prices or rates may differ from hypothetical changes 

commodity price risk we manage our commodity price risk in connection with market price fluctuations of aluminum primarily by entering into container sales contracts which generally include aluminumbased pricing terms that consider price fluctuations under our commercial supply contracts for aluminum purchases such terms generally include a fixed price or an upper limit to the aluminum component pricing this matched pricing affects most of our north american metal beverage container net sales we also at times use certain derivative instruments such as option and forward contracts as cash flow hedges of commodity price risk 

north american plastic container sales contracts include provisions to pass through resin cost changes as a result we believe we have minimal if any exposure related to changes in the cost of plastic resin most north american food container sales contracts either include provisions permitting us to pass through some or all steel cost changes we incur or incorporate annually negotiated steel costs in 2004 we were able to pass through steel surcharges to our customers and we are currently in negotiations with respect to 2005 steel price increases we believe these negotiations will result in the pass through of the majority of this year’s steel price increases 

in europe and asia the company manages aluminum and steel raw material commodity price risks through annual and longterm contracts for the purchase of the materials as well as certain sales of containers that reduce the company’s exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices within the current year these purchase and sales contracts include fixed price floating and passthrough pricing arrangements the company also uses forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges to minimize the company’s exposure to significant price changes for those sales contracts where there is not a passthrough arrangement 

considering the effects of derivative instruments the market’s ability to accept price increases and the company’s commodity price exposures a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the company’s metal prices could result in an estimated 38 million aftertax reduction of net earnings over a oneyear period additionally if foreign currency exchange rates were to change adversely by 10 percent we estimate there could be a 52 million aftertax reduction of net earnings over a oneyear period for foreign currency exposures on the metal actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates 

the company is also exposed to fluctuations in prices for utilities such as natural gas and electricity a hypothetical 10 percent increase in our utility prices could result in an estimated 53 million aftertax reduction of net earnings over a oneyear period actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates 

interest rate risk our objective in managing exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we use a variety of interest rate swaps and options to manage our mix of floating and fixedrate debt interest rate instruments held by the company at december 31 2004 and 2003 included payfixed and payfloating interest rate swaps payfixed swaps effectively convert variable rate obligations to fixed rate instruments payfloating swaps effectively convert fixedrate obligations to variable rate instruments 

based on our interest rate exposure at december 31 2004 assumed floating rate debt levels throughout 2005 and the effects of derivative instruments a 100 basis point increase in interest rates could result in an estimated 43 million aftertax reduction of net earnings over a oneyear period actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates and the timing of these changes 

foreign currency exchange rate risk our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to protect foreign cash flows and earnings associated with foreign exchange rate changes through the use of cash flow hedges in addition we manage foreign earnings translation volatility through the use of foreign currency options our foreign currency translation risk results from the european euro british pound canadian dollar polish zloty chinese renminbi brazilian real and serbian dinar we face currency exposures in our global operations as a result of purchasing raw materials in us dollars and to a lesser extent in other currencies sales contracts are negotiated with customers to reflect cost changes and where there is not a foreign exchange passthrough arrangement the company uses forward and option contracts to manage foreign currency exposures 

considering the company’s derivative financial instruments outstanding at december 31 2004 and the currency exposures a hypothetical 10 percent reduction in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the us dollar could result in an estimated 128 million aftertax reduction of net earnings over a oneyear period this amount includes the 52 million currency exposure discussed above in the “commodity price risk” section actual changes in market prices or rates may differ from hypothetical changes 

common share repurchases in connection with the company’s ongoing share repurchases on january 31 2005 ball repurchased 3 million of its common shares at an initial price of 4272 per share the price per share is subject to a price adjustment based on a weighted average price calculation for the period between the initial purchase date and the settlement date of july 6 2005 

the company also sells put options from time to time which give the purchasers of those options the right to sell shares of the company’s common stock to the company on specified dates at specified prices upon the exercise of those options the put option contracts allow us to determine the method of settlement either in cash or shares at december 31 2004 there were put option contracts outstanding for 200000 shares at 3175 per share which expired without value in february 2005 there were no put option contracts outstanding at december 31 2003

 part i item 1 business ball corporation was organized in 1880 and incorporated in indiana in 1922 its principal executive offices are located at 10 longs peak drive broomfield colorado 800212510 the terms ball the company we or our as used herein refer to ball corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries ball is a manufacturer of metal and plastic packaging primarily for beverages and foods and a supplier of aerospace and other technologies and services to commercial and governmental customers the following sections of the 2002 annual report to shareholders contain financial and other information concerning company business developments and operations and are incorporated herein by reference the notes to the consolidated financial statements including business segment information note 2 acquisitions note 3 business consolidation costs and other note 4 and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business developments in 2002 and early 2003 acquisitions on december 19 2002 ball acquired 100 percent of the outstanding shares of schmalbachlubeca gmbh a european beverage can manufacturer for an initial cash purchase price ofeuro9223 million approximately 948 million plus acquisition costs of 116 million refinancing costs of 281 million and the assumption of approximately 20 million of debt and 11 million of unencumbered cash in addition the company assumed approximately 300 million of unfunded pension liabilities the final acquisition price will be reduced by working capital and other adjustments estimated to be 239 million with this acquisition now known as ball packaging europe we became one of the worlds largest manufacturers of metal beverage cans with the ability to produce over 45 billion cans annually and we gained entry into the european market of which ball packaging europes share was approximately 31 percent in 2002 in addition we believe that in the first year of combined operations the acquisition will be accretive to our earnings per share and provide us returns on our capital invested in excess of our weighted average cost of capital on a pro forma basis the acquisition significantly increases our 2002 sales from 38 billion to 49 billion in connection with the acquisition we refinanced the company and as a result recorded an aftertax extraordinary charge from the early extinguishment of debt of 32 million 6 cents per diluted share the refinancing including related costs was completed with the placement of 300 million in 6875 senior notes due 2012 and 11 billion from borrowings under new longterm multicurrency senior credit facilities on march 11 2003 we acquired metal packaging international inc mpi a manufacturer of aluminum beverage can ends for 302 million in cash subject to working capital and other adjustments mpi produces just over 2 billion ends per year primarily for soft drink companies and had sales of approximately 42 million in 2002 mpis plant which is located in northglenn colorado will be closed and the volumes will be consolidated into other ball facilities the acquisition is not significant to the north american packaging segments financial statements other on february 25 2003 the company announced it will close its blytheville arkansas metal food container plant to address decreased demand for threepiece welded cans the plant will be closed in the second quarter of 2003 and its operations will be consolidated into the springdale arkansas plant the business consolidation will result in a charge of approximately 21 million 13 million after tax including 07 million of employee severance and benefit costs and 14 million related to decommissioning costs and an impairment charge on the fixed assets these actions are not expected to have a significant impact on ongoing financial results in december 2002 ball announced it would relocate its plastics office and research and development facility from atlanta georgia to colorado in connection with the relocation we recorded a pretax charge in 2002 of 16 million 1 million after tax for employeerelated and decommissioning costs and impairment of the leasehold improvements related to a leased facility the office relocation is expected to be completed in 2003 and the rd facility by the end of 2004 information pertaining to the business of the company the companys businesses are comprised of three segments 1 north american packaging 2 international packaging and 3 aerospace and technologies north american packaging our principal business in north america is the manufacture and sale of aluminum steel and pet containers primarily for beverages and foods this segment comprised 84 percent of balls 2002 consolidated net sales however this percentage will decrease to approximately 65 percent in 2003 due to the addition of ball packaging europe which is included in our international packaging segment a substantial part of our north american packaging sales are made directly to relatively few major companies in packaged beverage and food businesses including miller brewing company and bottlers of pepsicola and cocacola branded beverages and their licensees that utilize consolidated purchasing groups sales of aluminum cans and pet containers to miller brewing company pepsico inc and the cocacola company represented approximately 15 percent 13 percent and 8 percent of balls consolidated net sales respectively for the year ended december 31 2002 additional details about our sales to our major customers are included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements which can be found in exhibit 131 to this form 10k packaging products are sold in highly competitive markets primarily based on quality service and price the packaging business is capital intensive requiring significant investments in machinery and equipment profitability is sensitive to selling prices production volumes labor and the availability of certain raw materials such as aluminum steel and plastic resin these raw materials are generally available from several sources and we have secured what we consider to be adequate supplies and are therefore not experiencing any shortages we believe we have minimal if any exposure related to changes in the costs of aluminum steel and plastic resin as a result of 1 the inclusion of provisions in aluminum container sales contracts to pass through aluminum cost changes as well as the use of derivative instruments 2 steel can sales contracts that incorporate annually negotiated metal costs and 3 the inclusion of provisions in plastic container sales contracts to pass through resin cost changes our manufacturing facilities are dependent in varying degrees upon the availability of process energy such as natural gas and electricity while certain of these energy sources may become increasingly in short supply or halted due to external factors we cannot predict the effects if any of such occurrences on future operations research and development efforts in this segment generally seek to improve manufacturing efficiencies and lower unit costs principally raw material costs by reducing the material content of containers while improving or maintaining other physical properties such as material strength in addition research and development efforts are directed toward the development of new sizes and types of metal and plastic beverage and food containers as well as new uses for the current containers north american metal beverage containers metal beverage containers and ends represent balls largest product line accounting for approximately 70 percent of segment net sales and 58 percent of consolidated net sales in 2002 since 1998 we have been the largest beverage can producer in north america decorated twopiece aluminum beverage cans are produced at 17 manufacturing facilities in the us one facility in canada and one in puerto rico ends are produced within five of these us facilities the annual production capacity of these plants is currently approximately 33 billion cans metal beverage containers are sold primarily to fillers of carbonated soft drinks beer and other beverages under longterm or annual supply contracts sales volumes of metal beverage cans and ends in north america tend to be highest during the period from april through september through rocky mountain metal container llc a 5050 joint venture which is accounted for as an equity investment ball and coors brewing company coors operate coors can and end facilities in golden colorado the joint venture supplies coors with approximately 36 billion beverage cans and ends annually for its golden colorado and memphis tennessee breweries under agreements which commenced in january 2002 ball receives management fees and technology licensing fees under this agreement in addition to beverage cans supplied to coors from the joint venture substantially all of coors can requirements for its shenandoah virginia filling location are manufactured at ball facilities and sold to coors in middecember 2001 we ceased production at the moultrie georgia beverage can plant its production of one billion cans per year was consolidated into other ball plants based on publicly available industry information we estimate that our north american metal beverage container shipments were approximately 31 percent of total us and canadian shipments for metal beverage containers we also estimate that four producers represent substantially all of the remaining metal beverage container shipments available industry information indicates the growth in industrywide shipments was relatively flat over the past several years beverage container industry production capacity in the us and canada exceeds demand in order to balance more closely capacity and demand within our business we have consolidated our can and end manufacturing capacity into fewer more efficient facilities with the closure of five plants during 1999 2000 and 2001 the aluminum beverage can continues to compete aggressively with other packaging materials in the beer and soft drink industries the glass bottle has shown resilience in the packaged beer industry while soft drink industry use of the pet bottle has grown the beer industry also has begun the usage of plastic beer bottles in canada metal beverage containers have captured significantly lower percentages of the packaged beverage industry than in the us particularly in the packaged beer industry in which the market share of metal containers has been hindered by nontariff trade barriers and restrictive taxes within canada ball also participates in joint ventures in thailand and taiwan in addition to providing manufacturing technology and assistance to several can manufacturers around the world in addition to balls joint ventures current licensees of technology include fabricas monterrey sa de cv and amcor ltd among others north american metal food containers in addition to metal beverage cans ball produces twopiece and threepiece steel food cans for packaging vegetables fruit soups meat and other foods these steel food containers are manufactured in the us and canada and sold primarily to food processors in north america in 2002 metal food container sales comprised approximately 19 percent of north american packaging segment net sales sales volumes of metal food containers in north america tend to be highest from june through october as a result of seasonal vegetable and salmon packs approximately 33 billion steel food cans were shipped in the us and canada in 2002 of which we estimate approximately 16 percent were shipped by ball since the second quarter of 2000 ball and conagra grocery products company conagra have participated in a joint venture food can manufacturing company ball western can company ball western ball receives management fees and accounts for the results of its 50 percentowned investment under the equity method on december 30 2002 conagra notified ball of its desire to terminate and dissolve the ball western joint venture effective january 1 2004 ball and conagra are engaged in ongoing discussions to evaluate various options we recently signed a multiyear contract with abbott laboratories ross products division ross the makers of a broad range of infant formulas and food supplements ross will exit a portion of its selfmanufacturing operations in early 2003 to accommodate this new business and convert some of our existing threepiece food can customers to twopiece cans we are adding a new twopiece steel food can line in our milwaukee beverage can plant capable of producing approximately 12 billion cans per year as well as a new 225000squarefoot warehouse addition ball has two main competitors in the metal food containers business the steel food can also competes with other packaging materials in the food industry including glass aluminum plastic paper and the standup pouch as a result this product line must increasingly focus on product innovation service quality and price are deciding competitive factors north american plastic containers to capitalize on existing customer relationships ball entered the polyethylene terephthalate pet container business in 1995 pet packaging represented approximately 11 percent of packaging segment net sales in 2002 demand for containers made of pet has increased in the beverage packaging industry and is expected to increase in the food packaging industry with improved technology and adequate supplies of resin while pet beverage containers compete against metal glass and cardboard the historical increase in the sales of pet containers has come primarily at the expense of glass containers and through new market introductions the latest publicly available projections indicate that the growth in overall pet demand in north america over the next two years is expected to be between 7 and 8 percent based on research estimates from various sources we believe balls share of the total us and canadian shipments is between 8 and 12 percent on december 28 2001 we acquired substantially all of the assets of wispak plastics inc and entered into a longterm agreement to supply 100 percent of wispaks pet container requirements which are currently 550 million containers annually we closed one of the acquired plants in iowa during 2002 the aftertax cash costs associated with this closure were approximately 1 million and were substantially paid by the end of 2002 in addition to a wisconsin facility that ball acquired from wispak the company operates four pet facilities that it built in california iowa new jersey and new york four new plastic bottle blowmolding productions lines were added to three of our facilities throughout 2002 competition in the pet container industry includes several national and regional suppliers and selfmanufacturers service quality and price are deciding competitive factors increasingly the ability to produce customized differentiated plastic containers is an important competitive factor most of balls pet containers are sold under longterm contracts to suppliers of bottled water and carbonated soft drinks including pepsicola and cocacola plastic beer containers are being tested by several of our customers and we are developing plastic containers for the single serve juice market international packaging europe ball packaging europe and its operations consist of 10 beverage can plants and two beverage can end plants a technical center in bonn germany and the european headquarters in ratingen germany of the 12 plants four are located in germany four in the united kingdom two in france and one each in the netherlands and poland in total the newly acquired plants produce approximately 12 billion cans annually with 60 percent being produced from steel and 40 percent from aluminum five of the can plants use steel only three use aluminum and two plants use both metals ball packaging europes metal beverage container business is the second largest in europe with an estimated 2002 market share of 31 percent and produces twopiece beverage cans and can ends for beer carbonated soft drinks mineral water fruit juices isotonics milkbased beverages coffee drinks and alcoholic mixed drinks in western europe ball packaging europe is the top beverage container manufacturer in germany france and the benelux countries and the second largest beverage container manufacturer in the united kingdom in addition it has contributed to the development of the eastern european beverage market and has an estimated 50 percent market share in poland as in north america the metal beverage can continues to compete aggressively with other packaging materials in the european beer and soft drink industries the glass bottle is utilized in the packaged beer industry while soft drink industry use of the pet bottle has grown the european beverage can business has a relatively balanced and stable customer base with 10 customers accounting for approximately 55 percent of its gross trade sales and 20 customers accounting for approximately 70 percent of such sales ball packaging europes major customers include cocacola britvic pepsicola coors heineken interbrew and south african breweries our operations in germany are subject to packaging legislation that exempts oneway containers from a mandatory deposit fee as long as returnable containers maintain at least a 72 percent market share after the market share dropped below this mandated level regulators imposed a mandatory deposit fee on cans and other nonrefillable containers effective january 1 2003 although an effective container return system is not expected to be in place until october 2003 at the earliest it is too soon to determine the longterm impact the deposit fee will have on sales in germany but in the interim we have temporarily reduced production at our german plants in response to lower demand the european packaging business is capital intensive requiring significant investments in machinery and equipment profitability is sensitive to selling prices foreign exchange rates production volumes labor and the costs and availability of certain raw materials such as aluminum and steel the european market for steel and aluminum supply is highly consolidated with three steel suppliers and four aluminum suppliers providing 95 percent of european demand material supply contracts are generally for a period of one year although ball packaging europe has negotiated some longer agreements aluminum is purchased primarily in us dollars while the functional currencies of ball packaging europe and its subsidiaries are nonus dollars this inherently results in a foreign exchange rate risk which the company minimizes through the use of hedging contracts other international through ball asia pacific holdings limited we are the largest beverage can manufacturer in the peoples republic of china prc and believe that our facilities are the most modern in that country capacity has grown rapidly in the prc resulting in a supplydemand imbalance we undertook a review of our options there and as a result have closed several facilities during the past several years the beijing manufacturing facility is one of the most technologically advanced plants in the prc and the companys 34 percentowned affiliate sanshui jianlibao ftb packaging limited is the largest can manufacturing facility in the prc in terms of production capacity we are also a 50 percent equity owner of a joint venture in brazil that produces approximately 2 billion twopiece aluminum cans and ends and holds an estimated 15 percent market share for more information on balls international operations see item 2 properties and exhibit 211 subsidiary list aerospace and technologies the aerospace and technologies segment includes defense systems civil space systems and commercial space operations the defense operations business unit includes defense systems systems engineering services advanced antenna and video systems and electrooptics and cryogenic systems and components sales in the aerospace and technologies segment accounted for approximately 13 percent of consolidated net sales in 2002 the majority of the aerospace and technologies segment business involves work under contracts generally from one to five years in duration for the national aeronautics and space administration nasa the us department of defense dod and other us government agencies and for foreign governments contracts funded by the various agencies of the federal government represented approximately 96 percent of segment sales in 2002 geopolitical events and executive and legislative branch priorities have created considerable growth opportunities in our core competencies however consolidation in the aerospace and defense industries continues and there is strong competition for business civil space systems defense systems and commercial space operations include hardware software and services to both us and international customers with emphases on space science environmental and earth sciences defense and intelligence manned missions and space exploration major contractual activities frequently involve the design manufacture and testing of satellites ground systems and payloads including launch vehicle integration as well as satellite ground station control hardware and software the company also produces navigation and cryogenic equipment that is standard equipment on every space shuttle mission at this time the company anticipates minimal effect on its results from the loss of the space shuttle columbia on february 1 2003 other hardware activities include target identification warning and attitude control systems and components cryogenic systems for reactant storage and sensor cooling devices using either closedcycle mechanical refrigerators or opencycle solid and liquid cryogens star trackers which are generalpurpose stellar attitude sensors and faststeering mirrors additionally the aerospace and technologies segment provides diversified technical services and products to federal and local government agencies prime contractors and commercial organizations for a broad range of information warfare electronic warfare avionics intelligence training and space systems needs backlog of the aerospace and technologies segment was approximately 497 million and 431 million at december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively and consists of the aggregate contract value of firm orders excluding amounts previously recognized as revenue the 2002 backlog includes approximately 329 million expected to be billed during 2003 with the remainder expected to be billed thereafter unfunded amounts included in backlog for certain firm government orders which are subject to annual funding were approximately 334 million at december 31 2002 yeartoyear comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations the companys aerospace and technologies segment has contracts with the us government or its contractors which have standard termination provisions the government retains the right to terminate contracts at its convenience however if contracts are terminated in this manner ball is entitled to reimbursement for allowable costs and profits to the date of termination relating to authorized work performed to such date us government contracts are also subject to reduction or modification in the event of changes in government requirements or budgetary constraints patents in the opinion of the company none of its active patents is essential to the successful operation of its business as a whole research and development note 17 research and development in the 2002 annual report to shareholders contains information on company research and development activity and is incorporated herein by reference environment aluminum steel and pet containers are recyclable and significant amounts of used containers are being recycled and diverted from the solid waste stream using the most recent data available in 2001 approximately 55 percent of aluminum containers 58 percent of steel cans and 22 percent of the pet containers sold in the us were recycled recycling rates vary throughout europe but generally are comparable with rates for similar packaging materials in north america some of the highest rates are in germany where both aluminum and steel cans were recycled at rates estimated to be at least 80 percent prior to the imposition of mandatory deposits on oneway packaging effective january 1 2003 compliance with federal state and local laws relating to protection of the environment has not had a material adverse effect upon capital expenditures earnings or competitive position of the company as more fully described under item 3 legal proceedings the u s environmental protection agency and various state environmental agencies have designated the company as a potentially responsible party along with numerous other companies for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites however the companys information at this time does not indicate that these matters will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity results of operations or financial condition of the company legislation which would prohibit tax or restrict the sale or use of certain types of containers and would require diversion of solid wastes such as packaging materials from disposal in landfills has been or may be introduced in the us canada europe and asia while container legislation has been adopted in a few jurisdictions similar legislation has been defeated in public referenda in several others the company anticipates that continuing efforts will be made to consider and adopt such legislation in many jurisdictions in the future if such legislation was widely adopted it could have a material adverse effect on the business of the company as well as on the container manufacturing industry generally in view of the companys substantial global sales and investment in metal and pet container manufacture employees at the end of february 2003 the company employed approximately 12500 people worldwide including approximately 8300 employees in the united states and 4200 in other countries approximately 20 percent of the north american employees were unionized and approximately 90 percent of the european

 item 3 legal proceedings north america as previously reported the us environmental protection agency epa considers the company a potentially responsible party prp with respect to the lowry landfill site located east of denver colorado on june 12 1992 the company was served with a lawsuit filed by the city and county of denver denver and waste management of colorado inc seeking contribution from the company and approximately 38 other companies the company filed its answer denying the allegations of the complaint on july 8 1992 the company was served with a thirdparty complaint filed by sw shattuck chemical company inc seeking contribution from the company and other companies for the costs associated with cleaning up the lowry landfill the company denied the allegations of the complaint in july 1992 the company entered into a settlement and indemnification agreement with denver chemical waste management inc and waste management of colorado inc collectively waste pursuant to which denver and waste dismissed their lawsuit against the company and waste agreed to defend indemnify and hold harmless the company from claims and lawsuits brought by governmental agencies and other parties relating to actions seeking contributions or remedial costs from the company for the cleanup of the site several other companies which are defendants in the abovereferenced lawsuits had already entered into the settlement and indemnification agreement with denver and waste waste management inc has agreed to guarantee the obligations for chemical waste management inc and waste management of colorado inc denver and waste may seek additional payments from the company if the response costs related to the site exceed 319 million the company might also be responsible for payments calculated in 1992 dollars for any additional wastes which may have been disposed of by the company at the site but which are identified after the execution of the settlement agreement at this time there are no lowry landfill actions in which the company is actively involved based on the information available to the company at this time the company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity results of operations or financial condition of the company the company previously reported that on august 1 1997 the epa sent notice of potential liability to 19 prps concerning past activities at one or more of the four rocky flats parcels including land owned by precision chemicals now owned by great western inorganics at the rocky flats industrial park site rfip located in jefferson county colorado the rfip site also includes the aerrco site and a site owned by thoro products company based upon sampling at the site in 1996 the epa determined that additional site work would be required to determine the extent of contamination and the possible cleanup of the site the epa requested the prps to perform certain site work in 1996 these discussions have been ongoing on december 19 1997 the epa issued an administrative order on consent aoc to conduct the engineering estimates and cost analyses the aoc has been finalized the company has funded approximately 70000 toward these costs the prps have negotiated an agreement and the company contributed 5000 as an initial group contribution the company has agreed to pay 12 percent of the costs of cleanup at the aerrco site and a percentage of the cleanup costs on the thoro site on january 8 2003 the company made an additional payment of 97200 toward the cost of cleanup

corporation ball glass the assets of which were contributed in september 1995 into a joint venture with compagnie de saintgobain saintgobain now known as saintgobain industries inc and currently wholly owned by saintgobain received a general notification letter and information request from the epa region ix notifying ball glass that it may have a potential liability as defined in section 107a of the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla with respect to the san gabriel valley areas 14 superfund sites located in los angeles county california the epa requested certain information from ball glass and ball glass responded a prp group organized and drafted a prp group agreement which ball glass executed the prp group completed negotiations with the epa over the terms of the administrative consent order statement of work for the remedial investigation phase of the cleanup and the interim allocation arrangement between prp group members to fund the remedial investigation the interim allocation approach requires that any payment will be based upon contribution to pollution an aoc was executed by the prp group and the epa the epa also accepted the statement of work for the remedial investigation phase of the cleanup the prp group retained an environmental engineering consulting firm to perform the remedial investigation as required under the aoc the group submitted to the epa copies of all environmental studies conducted at the plant the majority of which had already been furnished to the state of california the epa then approved the work plan project management plan and the data management plan portions of the prp groups proposed rifs the prp group funded the rifs the prp groups environmental consulting firm then submitted its feasibility study technical memorandum 1 to the usepa concerning the site five potential remedial action plans were identified in the study usepa finalized the record of decision rod and selected the most extensive and expensive remedy the selected remedy is extraction and treatment of the solvent contaminated groundwater in both the east el monte and west el monte plumes both deep and shallow aquifers the prp group then commenced the final allocation process the allocation committee was assigned such task and undertook the development of the method for final allocation of costs among prp group members although final allocation has not been made the allocation committee will if necessary allocate costs so that prp group members responsible for the majority of the contamination will pay a higher percentage of the cleanup costs required by the rod as a result of such allocation method for final remediation costs ball glass performed additional soil vapor analysis testing to compliment its soil and groundwater sampling analyses previously conducted in a significant positive development the results of all 44vapor probe locations were nondetect for constituents of concern sampled ie those pollutants present in the area groundwater on november 11 1999 ball glass informed the prp group of these results which should reduce ball glass final cost allocation under such allocation method related to remediation costs the san gabriel basin water quality authority wqa committed to fund 500000 as an early response action program erap and as a result the prp group implemented a shallow aquifer groundwater treatment program under erap in order to obtain such matching public grant funds using group funds to install three west plume shallow aquifer groundwater remediation wells regarding the anticipated implementation of the final remedy negotiations continue with area water providers who may pump and treat deep aquifer groundwater from the east and west plumes if negotiations are successful the prp group members may only be responsible for remediation of shallow aquifers on the east and west sides of the operable unit the company has also been involved with other de minimis members of the prp group to settle this matter in august 2001 the de minimis members including the company finalized their de minimis offer to the prp group the amount of the offer is 375 million with the companys share being 391000 10 also the company and the other de minimis prps reached a tentative buyout settlement with gould industries and the other large prps who will be site work parties the work parties have submitted to usepa and subsequently withdrawn a goodfaith offer to conduct the final site remedial work site investigation work continues in addition the companys general liability insurer is defending this governmental action and is paying the cost of defense including attorneys fees under a reservation of rights based on the information or lack thereof available to the company at the present time the company is unable to express an opinion as to the actual exposure of the company however the company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity results of operations or financial condition of the company the company previously reported that in 1998 various consumers filed toxic tort litigation in the superior court for los angeles county trial court against various water companies operating in the san gabriel valley basin the water companies petitioned the trial court to remove this action to the california public utilities commission the trial court agreed the plaintiffs appealed this decision to the california court of appeals which reversed the trial court one nonregulated utility appealed this decision to the california supreme court pending completion of the appellate process the trial court stayed further action in this litigation except that the plaintiffs were permitted to add additional defendants plaintiffs have joined numerous companies which are alleged to be prps in the various operable units in the san gabriel valley superfund site the trial court consolidated the six separate lawsuits in the northeast district pasadena and designated the case of adler et al v southern california water company et al as the lead case in late march 1999 ballfoster glass container co llc now named saint gobain containers inc the present owner of the el monte glass plant and an entity in which the company has no current ownership interest received a summons and amended complaint based on its ownership of the el monte glass plant ballfoster glass tendered the lawsuit to the company for defense and indemnity the company in turn tendered this lawsuit to its general liability carrier for defense and indemnity the litigation including the filing of answers by such joined parties was stayed pending the decision of the california supreme court as to whether the california public utilities commission had sole jurisdiction over these cases since some of the defendants are regulated utilities on february 4 2002 the california supreme court issued its written opinion upholding the decision of the court of appeals ruling that the plaintiffs may proceed with their toxic tort claims in the trial court against all defendants including the company who are nonregulated utilities a complex case management order has been entered under the order the cases were divided into three groups with the company being named in only the adler case the plaintiffs were ordered to refile their complaints plaintiffs served the consolidated adler group complaint on the company and the company filed its answer to the group complaint at a hearing on october 21 2002 the judge dismissed the punitive damage claims in the complaint the case management order also allows limited discovery by written interrogatories and separate requests for production of documents similarly situated de minimis industry defendants have formed a joint defense group and the company has joined the group during january and february 2003 the company responded to discovery requests by the

thereof available to the company at the present time the company is unable to express an opinion as to the actual exposure for this matter however based on the information available to the company at the present time the company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity results of operations or financial condition of the company on december 30 2002 the company received a 104e letter from the usepa pursuant to the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla requesting answers to certain questions regarding the waste disposal practices of the heekin can company and the relationship between the company and the heekin can company region 5 of the epa is involved in the cleanup of the jackson brothers paint company site which consists of four and possibly five sites in and around laurel indiana the jackson brothers paint company apparently disposed of drums of waste in the 1960s and 1970s the usepa has alleged that some of the waste that has been uncovered was sent to the sites from the cincinnati plant operated by the heekin can company the indiana department of environmental management idem referred this matter to the usepa for removal of the drums and cleanup at the present time there are an undetermined number of drums at one or more of the sites that have been initially identified by the usepa as originating from the heekin can company the usepa has sent 104e letters to seven other potentially responsible parties including the heekin can company on january 30 2003 the company responded to the request for information pursuant to section 104e of cercla the usepa has initially estimated cleanup costs to be between 4 million and 5 million based on the information or lack thereof available to the company at the present time the company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity results of the operations or financial condition of the company the company previously reported that in march of 1992 william hallahan an employee of the companys metal container plant in saratoga springs new york filed a workers compensation claim alleging that he suffers from a form of leukemia that was caused by his exposure to certain chemicals used in the plant the company denied the claim and hearings on the matter were held before the workers compensation board of the state of new york testimony was concluded in april 1996 on january 14 1997 the administrative law judge alj filed his memorandum of decision finding in favor of the claimant the decision was appealed and the workers compensation board remanded the case back to the alj for further findings the alj made those findings and the company again appealed the case in june 1999 a threejudge panel of the workers compensation board reversed the decision of the alj and found that the claimant failed to show a causal relationship between the claimants workplace and his disease in order to establish that he developed an occupational disease from an exposure at the plant the board then closed the case the claimant appealed the case to the full workers compensation board and alternatively to the appellate division of the new york state judicial system on may 30 2000 the full workers compensation board denied mr hallahans appeal on april 6 2001 the general counsel of the new york state workers compensation board deemed mr hallahans appeal to have been abandoned on november 21 2001 mr hallahan filed a petition to reopen the workers compensation case on the basis that ethylene glycol monobutyl ethers 2butoxylthanol egbe may have been the possible cause of mr hallahans leukemia mr hallahans attorney requested the board to reopen the case under its continuing jurisdiction claimant also claims that this information supports their expert witness previous testimony at the hearing regarding the cause of mr hallahans leukemia mr hallahans counsel also argued that the epa supports the position that egbe is a possible human carcinogen the company filed a statement in opposition to mr hallahans petition to reopen the case on february 4 2002 the board denied the request to reopen the case this decision was not appealed this matter is now resolved with no material adverse effect upon the liquidity results of operations or financial condition of the company as previously reported on or about december 31 1992 william hallahan and his wife filed suit in the supreme court of the state of new york county of saratoga against certain manufacturers of solvents coatings and equipment including somerset technologies inc and belvac production machinery seeking damages in the amount of 15 million for allegedly causing leukemia by exposing him to harmful toxins somerset and belvac filed thirdparty complaints seeking contribution from the company for damages that they might be required to pay william hallahan the defendants including the company have filed a motion for summary judgment against the plaintiff requesting a judgment that the workers compensation board has determined this case against william hallahan on july 3 2002 the court entered a decision in favor of the defendants and us on august 13 2002 the court entered judgment on the decision on august 29 2002 mr hallahan and his wife filed an appeal in the appellate division on february 24 2003 the appellate division held a mandatory mediation conference regarding this case certain defendants settled this case with the plaintiffs as to all parties the company did not contribute to the settlement

positive judgment and confirmed that a duty to implement a mandatory deposit fee as of january 1 2003 does not exist according to that court a mandatory deposit fee to protect returnable containers is without legal basis in the current legislation other administrative courts have not yet scheduled hearings the german administration has filed an appeal against the suspensive effect of the judgment of the administrative court in northrhine westfalia to the oberverwaltungsgericht münster higher administrative court and has filed an appeal on the merits of the case to the bundesverwaltungsgericht

 part i item 1 business ball corporation was organized in 1880 and incorporated in indiana in 1922 its principal executive offices are located at 10 longs peak drive broomfield colorado 800212510 the terms ball the company we or our as used herein refer to ball corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries ball is a manufacturer of metal and plastic packaging primarily for beverages and foods and a supplier of aerospace and other technologies and services to commercial and governmental customers the following sections of the 2001 annual report to shareholders contain financial and other information concerning company business developments and operations and are incorporated herein by reference the notes to the consolidated financial statements including business segment information note 2 business consolidation costs and other note 3 acquisition note 4 and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business developments in 2001 and early 2002 ball took a number of actions in 2001 to address overcapacity in the industries in which we operate and to improve production efficiencies in june 2001 after an extensive review we announced a plan to exit the general line metal can business in the peoples republic of china prc and to further reduce our prc beverage can manufacturing capacity by closing two plants we have since sold the general line business closed one beverage can plant and are in the process of closing the second also in june 2001 we ceased operations in two commercial product lines in our aerospace and technologies business in middecember 2001 we closed our moultrie georgia beverage can plant charges recorded in connection with these actions totaled 2712 million on december 28 2001 ball acquired substantially all of the assets of wispak plastics inc wispak for approximately 275 million additional payments of up to 10 million in total including interest are contingent upon the future performance of the acquired business through 2006 under the acquisition agreement we entered into a tenyear agreement to supply 100 percent of wispaks annual pet container requirements which are currently 550 million containers additional details about the business consolidations charges and the acquisition are provided in notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements which can be found in exhibit 131 on january 1 2002 we commenced a 5050 joint venture agreement with coors brewing company coors for the manufacture and supply of the majority of the 45 billion beverage cans and ends used by coors annually ball will receive management fees under this agreement and will account for the joint venture using the equity method of accounting in addition to beverage cans supplied to coors from the joint venture ball will supply coors with beverage cans manufactured in other whollyowned ball facilities on january 23 2002 the companys board of directors declared a twoforone split of ball stock increased the next quarterly dividend and authorized the additional repurchase of common shares the stock split was effective february 22 2002 for all shareholders of record on february 1 2002 as a result of the stock split all amounts related to earnings per share share prices and share amounts have been retroactively restated for all periods presented information pertaining to the business of the company the companys businesses are comprised of two segments 1 packaging and 2 aerospace and technologies packaging segment balls principal business is the manufacture and sale of rigid packaging products primarily for beverages and foods packaging products are sold in highly competitive markets primarily based on quality service and price a substantial part of our packaging sales are made directly to relatively few major companies in packaged beverage and food businesses including miller brewing company and bottlers of pepsicola and cocacola branded beverages and their licensees utilizing consolidated purchasing groups additional details about our sales to these customers are included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements which can be found in exhibit 131 the rigid packaging business is capital intensive requiring significant investments in machinery and equipment profitability is sensitive to production volumes labor and the costs and availability of certain raw materials such as aluminum steel and plastic resin raw materials used in our packaging business are generally available from several sources we have secured what we consider to be adequate supplies of raw materials and are not experiencing any shortages our manufacturing facilities are dependent in varying degrees upon the availability of process energy such as natural gas and electricity while certain of these energy sources may become increasingly in short supply or halted due to external factors we cannot predict the effects if any of such occurrences on future operations research and development efforts in this business generally seek to improve manufacturing efficiencies and lower unit costs principally raw material costs by reducing the material content of containers while improving or maintaining other physical properties such as material strength in addition research and development efforts are directed toward the development of new sizes and types of metal and plastic beverage and food containers as well as new uses for the current containers decorated twopiece aluminum beverage cans are produced at 17 manufacturing facilities in the us one facility in canada and one in puerto rico ends are produced within five us facilities metal beverage containers are sold primarily to fillers of carbonated soft drinks beer and other beverages under longterm or annual supply contracts sales volumes of metal beverage cans and ends in north america tend to be highest during the period from april through september metal beverage containers and ends represent balls largest product line accounting for approximately 67 percent of 2001 packaging segment net sales since 1998 we have been the largest beverage can producer in north america based on publicly available industry information we estimate that our north american metal beverage container shipments were approximately 31 percent of total us and canadian shipments for metal beverage containers we also estimate that five producers represent substantially all of the remaining metal beverage container shipments available industry information indicates the growth in industrywide shipments was relatively flat from 1998 to 2001 in canada metal beverage containers have captured significantly lower percentages of the packaged beverage industry than in the us particularly in the packaged beer industry in which the market share of metal containers has been hindered by nontariff trade barriers and restrictive taxes within canada beverage container industry production capacity in the us and canada exceeds demand in order to balance more closely capacity and demand within our business we have consolidated our can and end manufacturing capacity into fewer more efficient facilities with the closure of five plants during 1999 2000 and 2001 as reported in note 3 in our annual report to shareholders which can be found in exhibit 131 the aluminum beverage can continues to compete aggressively with other packaging materials in the beer and soft drink industries the glass bottle has shown resilience in the packaged beer industry while the soft drink industry use of the pet bottle has grown the beer industry has also begun the usage of plastic beer bottles twopiece and threepiece steel food containers are manufactured in the us and canada and sold primarily to food processors in the us and canada in 2001 metal food container sales comprised approximately 19 percent of packaging segment net sales sales volumes of metal food containers in north america tend to be highest from june through october as a result of seasonal vegetable and salmon packs in the metal food container industry manufacturing capacity in north america exceeds demand approximately 33 billion steel food cans were shipped in the us and canada in 2001 of which approximately 17 percent were shipped by ball since the second quarter of 2000 ball and conagra grocery products company have participated in a joint venture food can manufacturing company ball western can company under this arrangement ball receives management fees and accounts for the results of its 50 percentowned investment under the equity method the steel food can competes with other packaging materials in the food industry including glass aluminum plastic and paper as a result this product line must increasingly focus on product innovation service quality and price are deciding competitive factors polyethylene terephthalate pet packaging is balls newest product line representing slightly less than 9 percent of packaging segment net sales in 2001 demand for containers made of pet has increased in the beverage packaging industry and is expected to increase in the food packaging industry with improved technology and adequate supplies of pet resin while pet beverage containers compete against metal glass and cardboard the historical increase in the sales of pet containers has come primarily at the expense of glass containers and through new market introductions the latest publicly available projections indicate that the growth in overall pet demand over the next two years is expected to be between 7 and 8 percent based on research estimates from various sources we believe balls share of the total us and canadian shipments is between 8 and 12 percent competition in the pet container industry includes four national suppliers and several regional suppliers and selfmanufacturers service quality and price are deciding competitive factors increasingly the ability to produce customized

 item 1 business ball corporation was organized in 1880 and incorporated in indiana in 1922 its principal executive offices are located at 10 longs peak drive broomfield colorado 800212510 the terms ball the company we or our as used herein refer to ball corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries ball is a manufacturer of metal and plastic packaging primarily for beverages and foods and a supplier of aerospace and other technologies and services to commercial and governmental customers the following sections of the 2000 annual report to shareholders contain financial and other information concerning company business developments and operations and are incorporated herein by reference the notes to the consolidated financial statements business segment information note 2 business consolidation costs and other note 3 acquisitions note 4 and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business developments in 2000 and early 2001 as result of improved operating efficiencies throughout our packaging business and in keeping with our strategy to keep manufacturing costs low we recorded an 834 million pretax charge 55 million after tax minority interests and equity earnings impacts or 177 per diluted share in the second quarter for packaging business consolidation and investment exit activities the charge includes costs associated with the permanent closure of a beverage can manufacturing facility in the us the elimination of food and beverage can manufacturing capacity at two locations in canada the consolidation of production capacity in the peoples republic of china prc and the writedown to net realizable value of an investment in a russian beverage can manufacturing joint venture these actions are expected to be completed during 2001 additional details about the business consolidations charge are provided in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements which can be found in exhibit 131 although we have taken various actions in the prc during the past several years the industry and market environment in which we operate in china are not improving at a satisfactory pace as a result we have begun an extensive review of options available to us in connection with our investment we expect to complete our review late in the second quarter of 2001 which will in all likelihood require the closure consolidation or sale of certain facilities at this time we have not determined the final structural changes the facilities to be affected or the amount of any potential charge as an initial step in this process the board of directors of one of our subsidiaries in china authorized local management at a plant in tianjin to develop an exit strategy for the general packaging business in northern china the completion of which is expected in the second quarter information pertaining to the business of the company the companys businesses are comprised of two segments 1 packaging and 2 aerospace and technologies packaging segment balls principal business is the manufacture and sale of rigid packaging products primarily for beverages and foods packaging products are sold in highly competitive markets primarily based on quality service and price a substantial part of our packaging sales are made directly to relatively few major companies in packaged beverage and food businesses including miller brewing company and worldwide bottlers of pepsicola and cocacola branded beverages and their licensees utilizing consolidated purchasing groups additional details about our sales to these customers are included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements which can be found in exhibit 131 the rigid packaging business is capital intensive requiring significant investments in machinery and equipment profitability is sensitive to production volumes labor and the costs of certain raw materials such as aluminum steel and plastic resin raw materials used in our packaging business are generally available from several sources we have secured what we consider to be adequate supplies of raw materials and are not experiencing any shortages our manufacturing facilities are dependent in varying degrees upon the availability of process energy such as natural gas and electricity while certain of these energy sources may become increasingly in short supply or halted due to external factors as is currently the case in california we cannot predict the effects if any of such occurrences on future operations research and development efforts in this business generally seek to improve manufacturing efficiencies and lower unit costs principally raw material costs by reducing the material content of containers while improving or maintaining other physical properties such as material strength in addition research and development efforts are directed toward the development of new sizes and types of metal and plastic beverage and food containers as well as new uses for the current containers decorated twopiece aluminum beverage cans are currently being produced at 18 manufacturing facilities in the us 1 facility in canada and 1 in puerto rico ends are produced within 5 us facilities metal beverage containers are sold primarily to fillers of carbonated soft drinks beer and other beverages under annual or longterm supply contracts sales volumes of metal beverage cans and ends in north america tend to be highest during the period from april through september metal beverage containers and ends represent balls largest product line accounting for approximately 61 percent of 2000 consolidated net sales as a result of a beverage can manufacturing asset acquisition in 1998 we expanded our metal beverage product line to include specialty cans and became the largest metal beverage can producer in north america based on publicly available industry information we estimate that our north american metal beverage container shipments were approximately 32 percent of total us and canadian shipments for metal beverage containers we also estimate that five producers represent substantially all of the remaining metal beverage container shipments available industry information indicates the growth in industrywide shipments was relatively flat from 1998 to 2000 but increased approximately 22 percent from 1997 to 1998 in canada metal beverage containers have captured significantly lower percentages of the packaged beverage industry than in the us particularly in the packaged beer industry in which the market share of metal containers has been hindered by trade barriers and restrictive taxes within canada beverage container industry production capacity in the us and canada exceeds demand in order to balance more closely capacity and demand within our business we have consolidated our can and end manufacturing capacity into fewer more efficient facilities with the closure of four plants during 1999 and 2000 as reported in our annual report to shareholders the aluminum beverage can continues to compete aggressively with other packaging materials in the beer and soft drink industries the glass bottle has shown resilience in the packaged beer industry while the soft drink industry use of the pet bottle has grown the beer industry has also begun the usage of plastic beer bottles twopiece and threepiece steel food containers are manufactured in the us and canada and sold primarily to food processors in the midwestern united states and canada in 2000 metal food container sales comprised approximately 16 percent of consolidated net sales sales volumes of metal food containers in north america tend to be highest from june through october as a result of seasonal vegetable and salmon packs in the metal food container industry manufacturing capacity in north america exceeds market demand approximately 34 billion steel food cans were shipped in the us and canada in 2000 of which approximately 18 percent were shipped by ball polyethylene terephthalate pet packaging is balls newest product line representing slightly more than 7 percent of consolidated net sales in 2000 demand for containers made of pet has increased in the beverage packaging industry and is expected to increase in the food packaging industry with improved technology and adequate supplies of pet resin while pet beverage containers compete primarily against metal and glass the historical increase in the sales of pet containers has come primarily at the expense of glass containers and through new market introductions the latest publicly available projections indicate that the growth in overall pet demand over the next two years is expected to be between 7 and 8 percent based on research estimates from various sources we believe balls share of the total us and canadian shipments is between 8 and 12 percent competition in the pet container industry includes four national suppliers and several regional suppliers and selfmanufacturers service quality and price are deciding competitive factors increasingly the ability to produce customized differentiated plastic containers is an important competitive factor ball has secured longterm customer supply agreements principally for carbonated beverage and water containers plastic beer containers are being tested by several of our customers and we are developing plastic containers for the single serve juice market we are the largest beverage can manufacturer in the prc supplying approximately 50 percent of the twopiece aluminum beverage cans used in the prc capacity has grown rapidly in the prc resulting in a supplydemand imbalance as discussed above we have begun a review of our options there which will likely require the consolidation closure or sale of certain facilities to date we have closed in the early part of 1999 two of our plants located in the prc and have reduced production capacity in other plants the beijing manufacturing facility is one of the most technologically advanced plants in the prc and the companys 34 percentowned affiliate sanshui jianlibao ftb packaging limited is the largest can manufacturing facility in the prc in terms of production capacity for more information on operations in the prc see item 2 properties and exhibit 211 subsidiary list we are a 50 percent equity owner of a joint venture with bbm participacoes sa producing twopiece aluminum cans and ends in brazil ball also participates in joint ventures in thailand taiwan and the philippines in addition to providing manufacturing technology and assistance to several can manufacturers around the world aerospace and technologies segment the aerospace and technologies segment includes civil space systems defense systems commercial space operations commercial products and technologies systems engineering services and advanced antenna and video systems sales in the aerospace and technologies segment accounted for approximately 10 percent of consolidated net sales in 2000 the majority of the aerospace and technologies segment business involves work under contracts of generally one to five years in length for the national aeronautics and space administration nasa the us department of defense dod and foreign governments contracts funded by the various agencies of the federal government represented approximately 85 percent of segment sales in 2000 major industry trends have not changed significantly with department of defense and nasa budgets remaining relatively flat however there is a growing worldwide demand for commercial space activities consolidation in the industry continues and there is strong competition for business civil space and defense systems and commercial space operations include hardware software and services to both us and international customers with emphases on space science environment and earth sciences defense and intelligence manned missions and exploration also included are the design manufacture and testing of satellites ground systems and payloads including launch vehicle integration as well as satellite ground station control hardware and software other hardware activities include electrooptics products for spacecraft guidance control instruments sensors and defense subsystems for surveillance warning target identification and attitude control cryogenic systems for reactant storage sensor cooling devices such as closedcycle mechanical refrigerators and opencycle solid and liquid cryogens star trackers which are generalpurpose stellar attitude sensors and faststeering mirrors additionally the aerospace and technologies segment provides diversified technical services and products to federal and local government agencies prime contractors and commercial organizations for a broad range of information warfare electronic warfare avionics intelligence training and space systems needs during 2000 we formed several strategic alliances to expand our commercial operations in the areas of radar operations internet connectivity and broadband data services the quikscat commercial satellite successfully launched in 1999 made the news during 2000 when it was announced that approximately 99 percent of all possible wind data had been processed in what scientists hailed as one of the most successful mapping missions our synthetic aperture radar antenna acquired topographic data of more than 476 million square miles of earth to be used by the national image and mapping agency to create the most accurate and complete topographic map of earth ever assembled backlog backlog of the aerospace and technologies segment was approximately 351 million and 346 million at december 31 2000 and 1999 respectively and consists of the aggregate contract value of firm orders excluding amounts previously recognized as revenue the 2000 backlog includes approximately 218 million expected to be billed during 2001 with the remainder expected to be billed thereafter unfunded amounts included in backlog for certain firm government orders which are subject to annual funding were approximately 215 million at december 31 2000 yeartoyear comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations the companys aerospace and technologies segment has contracts with the us government which have standard termination provisions the government retains the right to terminate contracts at its convenience however if contracts are terminated ball is entitled to be reimbursed for allowable costs and profits to the date of termination relating to authorized work performed to such date us government contracts are also subject to reduction or modification in the event of changes in government requirements or budgetary constraints patents in the opinion of the company none of its active patents is essential to the successful operation of its business as a whole research and development the research and development note in the 2000 annual report to shareholders contains information on company research and development activity and is incorporated herein by reference environment aluminum steel and pet containers are recyclable and significant amounts of used containers are being recycled and diverted from the solid waste stream using the most recent data available in 1999 approximately 63 percent of aluminum containers 58 percent of steel cans and 24 percent of the pet containers sold in the us were recycled compliance with federal state and local laws relating to protection of the environment has not had a material adverse effect upon capital expenditures earnings or competitive position of the company as more fully described under item 3 legal proceedings the u s environmental protection agency and various state environmental agencies have designated the company as a potentially responsible party along with numerous other companies for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites however the companys information at this time does not indicate that these matters will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity results of operations or financial condition of the company legislation which would prohibit tax or restrict the sale or use of certain types of containers and would require diversion of solid wastes such as packaging materials from disposal in landfills has been or may be introduced in the us congress and the canadian parliament in state and canadian provincial legislatures and other legislative bodies while container legislation has been adopted in a few jurisdictions similar legislation has been defeated in public referenda in several other states in local elections and in many state and local legislative sessions the company anticipates that continuing efforts will be made to consider and adopt such legislation in many jurisdictions in the future if such legislation was widely adopted it could have a material adverse effect on the business of the company as well as on the container manufacturing industry generally in view of the companys substantial north american sales and investment in metal and pet container manufacture employees at the end of february 2001 the company employed approximately 11200 people worldwide

 item 3 legal proceedings as previously reported the us environmental protection agency epa considers the company to be a potentially responsible party prp with respect to the lowry landfill site located east of denver colorado on june 12 1992 the company was served with a lawsuit filed by the city and county of denver denver and waste management of colorado inc seeking contribution from the company and approximately 38 other companies the company filed its answer denying the allegations of the complaint on july 8 1992 the company was served with a thirdparty complaint filed by sw shattuck chemical company inc seeking contribution from the company and other companies for the costs associated with cleaning up the lowry landfill the company denied the allegations of the complaint in july 1992 the company entered into a settlement and indemnification agreement with denver chemical waste management inc and waste management of colorado inc collectively waste pursuant to which denver and waste dismissed their lawsuit against the company and waste agreed to defend indemnify and hold harmless the company from claims and lawsuits brought by governmental agencies and other parties relating to actions seeking contributions or remedial costs from the company for the cleanup of the site several other companies which are defendants in the abovereferenced lawsuits had already entered into the settlement and indemnification agreement with denver and waste waste management inc has agreed to guarantee the obligations for chemical waste management inc and waste management of colorado inc denver and waste may seek additional payments from the company if the response costs related to the site exceed 319 million the company might also be responsible for payments calculated in 1992 dollars for any additional wastes which may have been disposed of by the company at the site but which are identified after the execution of the settlement agreement at this time there are no lowry landfill actions in which the company is actively involved based on the information available to the company at this time the company believes that this matter will not have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity results of operations or financial condition of the company as previously reported on april 24 1992 the company was notified by the muncie race track steering committee steering committee that the company through its former consumer products division and former zinc products division may be a prp with respect to waste disposal at the muncie race track site located in delaware county indiana the steering committee alleges that the company was a contributor to the site the steering committee requested that the company pay 2 percent of the cleanup costs which are estimated at this time to be 10 million the company declined to participate in the prp group because the companys records do not indicate the company contributed hazardous waste to the site the company continues to attempt to settle this claim based upon the information available to the company at this time the company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity results of operations or financial condition of the company as previously reported on august 1 1997 the epa sent notice of potential liability letters to 19 owners operators and waste generators concerning past activities at one or more of the four rocky flats parcels at the rocky flats industrial park site located in jefferson county colorado based upon sampling at the site in 1996 the epa determined that additional site work would be required to determine the extent of contamination and the possible cleanup of the site the epa requested the letter recipients conduct an engineering evaluation and cost analysis eeca of the site fourteen companies including the company have undertaken the study the epa is also seeking reimbursement for approximately 15 million which it has spent at the site on december 19 1997 the epa issued an administrative order to conduct the eeca to 18 owners operators and generators associated with the site the epa alleged that the company is the ninth largest generator of the thirteen generators issued administrative orders the prp group has undertaken the eeca at a cost of about 850000 of which the company has paid approximately 70000 site characterization work began in may 1998 and continued through june 1999 wells were installed and soil and groundwater samples were taken for analysis contamination does not exist in deep aquifers but is present in soil and shallow aquifers both in and off the aerr co property the draft eeca was submitted to usepa in january 2000 the final eeca was sent to usepa in june 2000 a final draft agreement for professional services was prepared in december 2000 for the prp consultant emsi to begin the next phase of site work the prps are discussing allocation formulas for the post eeca work balls future obligation to the group may be between 285000 and 385000 more expensive options such as insurance and a site buyout are under consideration by the prp group on september 29 2000 an administrative order on consent aoc for removal action for the rocky flats industrial park site was delivered to the epa by a prp group representative twelve companies signed the aoc to conduct work on the aerr co and thoro properties the epa agreed to forgo all past costs at the site and work with the prps to gain site access to conduct air sparging and soil vapor extraction assve activities the prps negotiated a revised group agreement ball will pay 12 percent of aerr co site costs and a percentage of thoro assve system operation costs any potential state natural resources damage claims are not a part of this agreement the department of interior has not yet waived federal natural resource damage claims so the department of justice has not approved the rfip administrative order on consent once approved the order will not be final until a 30day public comment period ends based upon the information available to the company at this time the company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity results of operations or financial condition of the company as previously reported the company was notified on june 19 1989 that the epa has designated the company and numerous other companies as prps responsible for the cleanup of certain hazardous wastes that were released at the spectron inc site located in elkton maryland in december 1989 the company along with other companies whose alleged hazardous waste contributions to the spectron inc site were considered to be de minimis entered into a settlement agreement with the epa for cleanup costs incurred in connection with the removal action of aboveground site areas by a letter dated september 29 1995 the company along with other abovedescribed prps was notified by the epa that it was negotiating with the largevolume prps another consent order for performance of a site environmental study as a prerequisite to longterm remediation the epa and the largevolume prps have stated that a second de minimis buyout for settlement of liability for performance of all environmental studies and site remediation is being formulated and an offer to participate therein has been made to the company the company has joined with a group of de minimis prps to negotiate a reduction ie a lower price per gallon assessment in the proposed de minimis settlement offer epa is expected to issue its de minimis settlement offer in may 2001 based upon the information available to the company at this time the company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity results of operations or financial condition of the company as previously reported the company was named a prp with respect to the solvents recovery site located in southington connecticut according to the information received by the company it is alleged that the company contributed approximately 008816 percent of the waste contributed to the site on a volumetric basis the company responded and has investigated the accuracy of the total volume alleged to be attributable to the company the company joined the prp group during 1993 in february 1995 the company executed a trust agreement whereby certain contributions will be made to fund the administration of an ongoing work group the group members finalized an administrative order on consent for removal action and remedial investigationfeasibility study on february 6 1997 pursuant to which the group members will perform a removal action and completion of a remedial investigation and feasibility study in connection with the site based upon the information available to the company at this time the company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity results of operations or financial condition of the company as previously reported on or about june 14 1990 the el monte plant of ballincon glass packaging corp a then wholly owned subsidiary of the company renamed ball glass container corporation ball glass the assets of which were contributed in september 1995 into a joint venture with compagnie de saintgobain saintgobain now known as ballfoster glass container co llc and wholly owned by saint gobain received a general notification letter and information request from the epa region ix notifying ball glass that it may have a potential liability as defined in section 107a of the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla with respect to the san gabriel valley areas 14 superfund sites located in los angeles county california the epa requested certain information from ball glass and ball glass responded the company received notice from the city of el monte that pursuant to a proposed city economic redevelopment plan the city proposed to commence groundwater cleanup by a pump and treat remediation process as of march 1 2001 the city has not commenced this remediation a prp group organized and drafted a prp group agreement which ball glass executed the prp group retained an environmental engineering firm to critique the epa studies and any proposed remediation the prp group completed negotiations with the epa over the terms of the administrative consent order statement of work for the remedial investigation phase of the cleanup and the interim allocation arrangement between prp group members to fund the remedial investigation the interim allocation approach requires that any payment will be based upon contribution to pollution balls interim allocation is 579 percent the administrative consent order was executed by the prp group and the epa the epa also accepted the statement of work for the remedial investigation phase of the cleanup the prp group retained an environmental engineering consulting firm to perform the remedial investigation as required under the administrative consent order the group submitted to the epa copies of all environmental studies conducted at the plant the majority of which had already been furnished to the state of california the epa then approved the work plan project management plan and the data management plan portions of the prp groups proposed remedial investigationfeasibility study rifs the group funded the rifs the environmental consulting firm retained by the prp group submitted to the epa its feasibility study technical memorandum 1 concerning the site five potential remedial action plans were identified in the study ranging from no action to an extensive groundwater remediation project for both shallow and deep aquifers the costs of such remedies ranged from minimal costs for no action to between 105 to 25 million for the three groundwater pump and treat options proposed the prp group negotiated with the epa over the remedy selections for the record of decision rod and has formed an allocation committee for making final allocation of remediation costs between group members the epa has finalized the rod and selected the most extensive and expensive remedy the selected remedy is extraction and treatment of the solvent contaminated groundwater in both the east el monte and west el monte plumes both deep and shallow aquifers the prp group has commenced the final allocation process the allocation committee has been assigned such task and continues the development of the method for final allocation of costs among prp group members although final allocation has not been made the allocation committee will allocate costs so that prp group members responsible for the majority of the contamination will pay a higher percentage of the cleanup costs required by the rod once it is finalized and issued since final costs will be allocated under such method ball glass decided to perform soil vapor analysis testing to compliment its soil and groundwater sampling analyses previously conducted soil vapor analysis was conducted during the week of october 25 1999 in a significant positive development the results of all 44 vapor probe locations were nondetect for concern constituents sampled ie those pollutants present in the area groundwater on november 11 1999 ball glass informed the prp group of these results which should reduce ball glass final cost allocation under such allocation method on march 14 2000 ball glass made a formal presentation to the allocation committee and requested based upon its analytical data described above that its final allocation be reduced from the 579 percent interim allocation percentage the san gabriel basin water quality authority wqa has committed to fund 500000 as an early response action program erap and as a result the prp group is in the process of implementing a shallow aquifer groundwater treatment program under erap in order to obtain such matching public grant funds using group funds to install three west plume shallow aquifer groundwater remediation wells the prp group is implementing such action under the erap since the availability of erap public grant funds ceases at the point epa issues special notice letters requiring the prp group members to enter an administrative consent order implementing the final cleanup remedy required by the rod regarding the anticipated implementation of the final remedy negotiations continue with area water providers who may pump and treat deep aquifer groundwater from the east and west plumes if these negotiations are successful the prp group members may only be responsible for remediation of shallow aquifers on the east and west sides of the operable unit the epa is requiring the prp group to pay 400000 of the epas past site operation costs plus interest such payment must be made within the next three years however the epa has agreed to accept installment payments the prp group anticipates making a 100000 installment payment by may 31 2001 in addition commercial union the corporations general liability insurer is defending this governmental action and is paying the cost of defense including attorneys fees based on the information available to the company at this time the company is unable to express
