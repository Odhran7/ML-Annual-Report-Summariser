distribution system  the following table details the breakdown of our automotive distribution network including our distribution centers companyowned and independentlyowned automotive parts stores by geographic region as of december 31 2021 



the mix of companyowned stores versus independentlyowned stores in a given market varies based on several factors including our overall market strategy the ability to access desirable local retail space the complexity profitability and expected ultimate size of the market and our ability to provide operational support within a geographic region in our australasian operations the company goes to market with a companyowned store model 

independentlyowned stores purchase inventory from companyoperated distribution centers these independentlyowned stores are responsible for operating and managing their business including operating costs and capital expenditures the company does not receive a royalty or franchise fee from independentlyowned stores

risks that follow are organized within relevant headings but may be relevant to other headings as well in addition the material risks and uncertainties described below does not indicate that the risk has not already materialized 

strategic and operational risks 

the impact of the covid19 pandemic has significantly impacted worldwide economic conditions and our operations and our financial results have been and may in the future be materially impacted and the duration and extent to which it will impact our business remains uncertain 

the covid19 pandemic continues to impact various aspects of our business and the longterm impact to our business remains unknown the extent to which the covid19 pandemic impacts the company will depend on numerous factors and future developments that we cannot predict including the severity of the virus the occurrence of additional waves or spikes in infection rates including due to the emergence and spread of variants the duration of the outbreak governmental business or other actions taken in response to the pandemic and the efficacy of these actions including partial or complete shut downs travel restrictions and stayathome orders among other actions the timing distribution effectiveness and public acceptance of covid19 vaccines and impacts on our supply chain our ability to keep operating locations open and on customer demand 

the company and management continue to focus on mitigating the impact of the covid19 pandemic which has required and will continue to require a large investment of time and resources while we have added safety measures to protect our employees and customers continued business disruption caused by covid19 may require further significant actions to mitigate the impact including but not limited to reductions in store hours and store closings as well as ongoing increases in expenses conversely if the unprecedented levels of customer demand we have experienced during the pandemic revert or subside we may be unable to reduce expenses or otherwise react quickly and effectively to such changes 

additional adverse changes and volatility in economic conditions as a result of the pandemic may also lead to increased credit concerns and challenges to recover accounts receivable reduced liquidity adverse impacts on our suppliers and customers including on their abilities to continue to operate as a going concern 

due to the unprecedented nature of covid19 and the myriad of responses thereto we cannot identify all of the risks we face from the pandemic and its resulting impacts even after the pandemic has subsided we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of any economic recession that has occurred or may occur the pandemic could also amplify other risks and uncertainties described in this 2021 annual report on form 10k the ultimate adverse impacts relating to the potential effect of the covid19 pandemic on our business and the costs that we may incur as a result cannot be reasonably estimated but could be material 

our business will be adversely affected if demand for our products slows 

our business depends on customer demand for the products that we distribute demand for these products depends on many factors 

with respect to our automotive group the primary factors are 

• the number of miles vehicles are driven annually as higher vehicle mileage increases the need for maintenance and repair 

• the number of vehicles in the automotive fleet a function of new vehicle sales and vehicle scrappage rates as a steady or growing total vehicle population supports the continued demand for maintenance and repair 

• the quality of the vehicles manufactured by the original vehicle manufacturers and the length of the warranty or maintenance offered on new vehicles 

• the number of vehicles in current service that are six years old and older as these vehicles are typically no longer under the original vehicle manufacturers’ warranty and will need more maintenance and repair than newer vehicles 

• the addition of electric vehicles hybrid vehicles ride sharing services alternative transportation means and autonomously driven vehicles and future legislation related thereto 

• gas prices as increases in gas prices may deter consumers from using their vehicles 

• changes in travel patterns which may cause consumers to rely more on other transportation 

• the weather as milder weather conditions may lower the failure rates of automotive parts while extended periods of rain and winter precipitation may cause our customers to defer maintenance and repair on their vehicles extremely hot or cold conditions may enhance demand for our products due to increased failure 

rates of our customers’ automotive parts and global warming trends and other significant climate changes can create more variability in the short term or lead to other weather conditions that could impact our business 

• restrictions on access to diagnostic tools and repair information imposed by the original vehicle manufacturers or by governmental regulation as consumers may be forced to have all diagnostic work repairs and maintenance performed by the vehicle manufacturers’ dealer networks and 

• the economy generally which in declining conditions may cause consumers to defer vehicle maintenance and repair and defer discretionary spending 

with respect to our industrial parts group the primary factors are 

• the level of industrial production and manufacturing capacity utilization as these indices reflect the need for industrial replacement parts 

• changes in manufacturing reflected in the level of the institute for supply management’s purchasing managers index as an index reading of 50 or more implies an expanding manufacturing economy while a reading below 50 implies a contracting manufacturing economy 

• the consolidation of certain of our manufacturing customers and the trend of manufacturing operations being moved overseas which subsequently reduces demand for our products 

• changes in legislation or government regulations or policies which could impact international trade among our multinational customer base and cause reduced demand for our products and 

• the economy in general which in declining conditions may cause reduced demand for industrial output 

we depend on our relationships with our suppliers and a disruption of these relationships or of our suppliers’ operations could harm our business 

as a distributor of automotive and industrial parts our business depends on developing and maintaining close and productive relationships with our suppliers we depend on our suppliers to sell us quality products at favorable prices a variety of factors many outside our control affect our suppliers ability to deliver quality merchandise to us at favorable prices and in a timely manner these include raw material shortages inadequate manufacturing capacity labor strikes shortages and disputes anywhere within the supply and distribution chain delivering products to us tariff and customs legislation and enforcement transportation disruptions tax and other legislative uncertainties pandemics including the current covid19 pandemic andor weather conditions since the beginning of the covid19 pandemic we have experienced supply chain disruptions particularly with regard to global labor shortages and inventory sourced from outside the us these disruptions have not had a material impact on our business to date but we cannot provide any assurance that these or new supply chain disruptions will not materially or adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations in the future 

furthermore financial or operational difficulties at a particular supplier could cause that supplier to increase the cost or decrease the quality of the products we purchase supplier consolidation could also limit the number of suppliers from which we may purchase products and could materially affect the prices we pay for these products in addition we would suffer an adverse impact if our suppliers limit or cancel the return privileges that currently protect us from inventory obsolescence 

we face substantial competition in the industries in which we do business 

the sale of automotive and industrial parts is highly competitive and impacted by many factors including name recognition product availability customer service changing customer preferences store location and pricing pressures because we seek to offer competitive prices we may be forced to reduce our prices if our competitors reduce their prices which could result in a material decline in our revenues and earnings increased competition among distributors of automotive and industrial parts including increased availability among digital and ecommerce providers across the markets in which we do business could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations the company anticipates no decline in competition in any of its business segments in the foreseeable future 

in particular the market for replacement automotive parts is highly competitive and subjects us to a wide variety of competitors we compete primarily with national international and regional auto parts chains independently owned regional and local automotive parts and accessories stores automobile dealers that supply manufacturer replacement parts and accessories mass merchandisers internet providers and wholesale clubs that sell automotive products and regional and local full service automotive repair shops both new and established 

furthermore the automotive aftermarket industry continues to experience consolidation consolidation among our competitors could further enhance their financial position provide them with the ability to offer more competitive prices to customers for whom we compete and allow them to achieve increased efficiencies in their consolidated operations that enable them to more effectively compete for customers if we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies or if our competitors develop more effective strategies we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

if we experience a security breach if our internal information systems fail to function properly or if we are unsuccessful in implementing integrating or upgrading our information systems our business operations could be materially affected 

we depend on information systems to process customer orders manage inventory and accounts receivable collections purchase products manage accounts payable processes ship products to customers on a timely basis maintain cost effective operations provide superior service to customers and accumulate financial results among many other things 

despite our implementation of various security measures our it systems and operations could be subject to damage or interruption from computer viruses natural disasters unauthorized physical or electronic access power outages telecommunications failure computer system or network failures wire transfer failure employee errormalfeasance cyberattacks security breaches and other similar disruptions additionally the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyberattacks and breaches of it systems change frequently and have the potential to not be recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time maintaining operating and protecting these systems and related personal information about our employees customers and suppliers requires continuous investments in physical and technological security measures employee training and thirdparty services which we have made and will continue to make a cyberattack or security breach could result in among other things sensitive and confidential data being lost manipulated or exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public or delay our ability to process customer orders and manage inventory while we also seek to obtain assurances from third parties with whom we interact to protect confidential information there are risks that the confidentiality or accessibility of data held or utilized by such third parties may be compromised 

to date we have not experienced a material breach of cybersecurity however our computer systems have been and will likely continue to be subjected to unauthorized access or phishing attempts computer viruses malware ransomware or other malicious codes in particular in connection with the covid19 pandemic there has been a spike in cybersecurity attacks as shelter in place orders and work from home measures have led businesses to increase reliance on virtual environments and communications systems which have been subjected to increasing thirdparty vulnerabilities and security risks 

a serious prolonged disruption of our information systems for any of the above reasons could materially impair fundamental business processes and increase expenses decrease sales or otherwise impact earnings and cash flows furthermore such a disruption may harm our reputation and business prospects and subject us to legal claims if there is loss disclosure or misappropriation of or access to our customers employees or suppliers information as the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and use and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous compliance with these requirements could also result in significant additional costs as threats related to cybersecurity breaches grow more sophisticated and frequent it may become more difficult to timely detect and protect our data and infrastructure 

we may not be able to successfully implement our business initiatives in each of our business segments to grow our sales and earnings which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have implemented numerous initiatives in each of our business segments to grow sales and earnings including the introduction of new and expanded product lines strategic acquisitions such as the recent acquisition of kaman distribution group geographic expansion including through acquisitions sales to new markets enhanced customer marketing programs and a variety of gross margin and cost savings initiatives if we are unable to implement these initiatives efficiently and effectively or if these initiatives are unsuccessful our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

successful implementation of these initiatives also depends on factors specific to the automotive parts and industrial parts industries and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control in addition to the other risk factors contained in this “item 1a risk factors” adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our business initiatives and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

• the competitive environment in our end markets may force us to reduce prices below our desired pricing level or to increase promotional spending 

• our ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and to meet customers’ needs for our products in a timely manner 

• our ability to successfully enter new markets including by successfully identifying and acquiring suitable acquisition targets in these new markets 

• our ability to effectively manage our costs 

• our ability to continue to grow through acquisitions and successfully integrate acquired businesses including kaman distribution group in our existing operations including in particular the challenges associated with the integration of foreign operations to ensure the adequacy of internal controls 

• our ability to identify and successfully implement appropriate technological digital and ecommerce solutions 

• the rate of adoption of electric vehicles hybrid vehicles ride sharing services alternative transportation means and autonomously driven vehicles and future legislation related thereto 

• the economy of each of the nations in which we operate in general including the monetary policies of the federal reserve which are influenced by various factors including inflation unemployment and shortterm and longterm changes in the international trade balance and the fiscal policies of the us government 

• the occurrence of unusually severe weather events which can disrupt our operations forcing temporary closure of retail and distribution centers prohibiting shipment of inventory and products and negatively impact our results in the affected geographies 

• the occurrence of political unrest and strikes which can disrupt our operations and negatively impact our results in the affected geographies 

• volatility in oil prices which could have a negative impact on the global economy and the economy of each of the nations in which we operate in particular and 

• the adequacy of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting 

we recognize the growing demand for businesstobusiness and businesstocustomer ecommerce options and solutions and we could lose business if we fail to provide the ecommerce options and solutions our customers wish to use 

our retail and business customers increasingly demand convenient easytouse ecommerce tools as an option to conduct their business with us the success of our ecommerce platform depends on our ability to accurately identify the products to make available through our ecommerce platform and to provide and maintain an efficient online experience with the highest level of data security for our customers operating an ecommerce platform is a complex undertaking and exposes us to risks and difficulties frequently experienced by internetbased businesses included risks related to among other things our ability to support expand and develop our internet operations website mobile applications and software and related operational systems continuing to improve our ecommerce platform involves substantial investment of capital and resources increasing supply chain and distribution capabilities attracting developing and retaining qualified personnel with relevant subject matter expertise and effectively managing and improving the customer experience if we are unable to successfully provide the ecommerce solutions our retail and business customers desire we may lose existing customers and fail to attract new ones our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected as a result 

we are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key persons could harm our business 

our future success significantly depends on the continued services and performance of our key management personnel we believe our management team’s depth and breadth of experience in our industry is integral to executing our business plan we also will need to continue to attract motivate and retain other key personnel the loss of services of members of our senior management team or other key employees the inability to attract additional qualified personnel as needed or failure to plan for the succession of senior management and key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our strategic transactions involve risks which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions 

we regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions including mergers acquisitions investments alliances and other growth and market expansion strategies with the expectation that these transactions will result in increases in sales cost savings synergies and various other benefits assessing the viability and realizing the benefits of these transactions is subject to significant uncertainty and we face significant competition in pursuing strategically beneficially transactions pursuing strategic transactions is also a timeconsuming process that can involve significant expenses and management attention for each of our acquisitions we need to successfully integrate the target company’s products services associates and systems into our business operations integration can be a complex and timeconsuming process and if the integration is not fully successful or is delayed for a material period of time we may not achieve the anticipated synergies or benefits of the acquisition furthermore even if the target companies are successfully integrated the acquisitions may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated expose us to increased competition or challenges with respect to our products or services and expose us to additional liabilities any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets acquired in a strategic transaction may reduce our earnings in addition any investments we hold in other companies are subject to a risk of partial or total loss of our investment 

additionally we consider and enter into divestitures from time to time with the expectation that these transactions will result in increases in cost savings and various other benefits strategic divestitures are subject to uncertainty and can be a complex and timeconsuming process if the divestiture is not fully successful or is delayed for a material period of time or if we are unable to reinvest the proceeds of the divestiture in a manner consistent with our strategic objectives we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the divestiture 

if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis which could result in a loss of investor confidence and negatively impact our business results of operations financial condition and stock price 

effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial statements and to effectively prevent fraud however a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met there can be no assurance that all control issues or fraud will be detected as we continue to grow our business our internal controls continue to become more complex and require more resources further many of our employees are working remotely in response to the impact of the covid19 pandemic and may continue to do so for an extended period an extended period of remote work arrangements could introduce potential vulnerabilities to our financial reporting systems and our internal control environment and the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting any failure to maintain effective controls could prevent us from timely and reliably reporting financial results and may harm our operating results in addition if we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified report as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of each fiscal year end we may be exposed to negative publicity which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information any failure to maintain effective internal controls and any such resulting negative publicity may negatively affect our business and stock price 

additionally the existence of any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies would require management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and management may not be able to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in a timely manner the existence of any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could also result in errors in our financial statements that could require us to restate our financial statements cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause stockholders to lose confidence in our reported financial information all of which could materially and adversely affect us and the market price of our common stock 

macroeconomic industry and financial risks 

changes in legislation or government regulations or policies particularly those relating to taxation and international trade could have a significant impact on our results of operations 

our business is global so changes to existing international trade agreements blocking of foreign trade or imposition of tariffs on foreign goods could result in decreased revenues andor increases in pricing either of which could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows in future periods for instance the united states imposed section 232 tariffs on many imported products of steel and aluminum in march 2018 and expanded the tariffs to additional derivative products of steel and aluminum effective 

february 8 2020 the united states imposed section 301 tariffs on most imported products from china starting in july 2018 although the united states and china reached a phase one trade deal in january 2020 there was no phase two trade deal implemented and most of the tariffs imposed remain in place while uncertainty persists in the trade relationship between the two countries that impacts the global trade landscape 

in addition as a global business we are subject to taxation in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate changes in the tax laws of these jurisdictions or in the interpretation or enforcement of existing tax laws could subject our business to audits inquiries and legal challenges from taxing authorities and could reduce the benefit of tax structures previously implemented for our operations as a result we may incur additional costs including taxes and penalties for historical periods that may have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

uncertainty andor deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions domestically and globally including inflation or deflation employment rates and wages changes in tax policies changes in energy costs uncertain credit markets or other economic conditions could have a negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our business and operating results have been and may in the future be adversely affected by uncertain global economic conditions including inflation or deflation domestic outputs political uncertainty and unrest employment rates and wages including increases in minimum wage changes in tax policies changes in energy costs instability in credit markets declining consumer and business confidence fluctuating commodity prices interest rates volatile exchange rates and other challenges that could affect the global economy both our commercial and retail customers may experience deterioration of their financial resources which could result in existing or potential customers delaying or canceling plans to purchase our products our vendors could experience similar negative conditions which could impact their ability to fulfill their financial obligations to us future weakness in the global economy could adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our debt levels could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations 

we have an unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured senior notes which could have important consequences to our financial health for example our level of indebtedness could among other things 

• make it more difficult to satisfy our financial obligations including those relating to our unsecured revolving credit facility and our unsecured senior notes 

• increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions 

• limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes and opportunities in our industry which may place us at a competitive disadvantage 

• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows to service the principal and interest on the debt reducing the funds available for other business purposes such as working capital capital expenditures or other cash requirements 

• limit our ability to incur additional debt with acceptable terms and 

• expose us to fluctuations in interest rates 

the terms of our financing obligations include restrictions such as affirmative negative and financial covenants conditions on borrowing and subsidiary guarantees a failure to comply with these restrictions could result in a default under our financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions the occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we also guarantee the borrowings of certain independently owned automotive parts stores and certain other affiliates in which we have a noncontrolling equity ownership interest to date we have not experienced any significant losses in connection with these guarantees however if any of the borrowers under these guarantees experienced a default we may be required to satisfy their payment obligations in an amount that could be material 

in addition our indebtedness is rated by credit rating agencies our overall credit rating may be negatively impacted by deteriorating and uncertain credit markets or other factors that may or may not be within our control the interest rates on our unsecured revolving credit facility as well as any additional indebtedness we may incur in the future are impacted by our credit ratings accordingly any negative impact of our credit ratings or placement of our credit ratings on “review” or “watch” status could result in higher interest expense and could impact the terms of any additional indebtedness we incur in the future 

we may be adversely affected by changes in the method of determining the london interbank offered rate “libor” or the replacement of libor with an alternative reference rate for our variable rate loans derivative contracts and other financial assets and liabilities 

our business relies upon a large volume of loans derivative contracts and other financial instruments which are directly or indirectly dependent on libor to establish their interest rate andor value the uk financial conduct authority announced in 2017 that it would no longer compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 it is not possible to predict whether banks will continue to provide libor submissions to the administrator of libor whether libor rates will cease to be published or supported after 2021 or whether any additional reforms to libor may be enacted in the united kingdom or elsewhere it is expected that a transition away from the widespread use of libor to alternative rates is likely to occur during the next several years 

while we have established a working group consisting of key stakeholders from throughout the company to monitor developments relating to libor uncertainty and changes and to guide the company’s response the impact of these developments on our business and financial results is not yet known the transition from libor may cause us to incur increased costs and additional risk uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes in or other reforms to libor may adversely affect libor rates and the value of liborbased loans originated prior to 2021 if libor rates are no longer available any successor or replacement interest rates may perform differently which may affect our net interest income change our market risk profile and require changes to our risk pricing and hedging strategies we may also incur costs to reform existing derivative contracts and other financial instruments to which we are a party to address these differences in performance relative to libor or relative to adjustments made in other loans derivative contracts or financial instruments where we are a party any failure to adequately manage this transition could adversely impact our business results of operations and cash flows 

legal and regulatory risks 

we may be affected by global climate change or legal tax regulatory or market responses to such change 

the concern over climate change has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions “ghg” for example proposals that would impose mandatory requirements related to ghg continue to be considered by policy makers in the us and elsewhere for example significant increases in fuel economy requirements new federal or state restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide or new federal or state incentive programs that may be imposed on vehicles and automobile fuels could adversely affect demand for the products we sell we may not be able to accurately predict prepare for and respond to new kinds of technological innovations with respect to electric vehicles and other technologies that minimize emissions laws enacted to reduce ghg could directly or indirectly affect our suppliers and could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows changes in automotive technology including the adoption of electric vehicles and compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretations of existing laws could require additional expenditures by us or our suppliers all of which could adversely impact the demand for our products and our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

because we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees and other costs as well as reputational harm 

we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers employees or other third parties for various reasons for example we are party to among other litigation numerous pending product liability lawsuits relating to our national distribution of automotive parts and supplies many of which involve claims of personal injury allegedly resulting from the use of automotive parts distributed by us the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected in particular on july 8 2021 the washington supreme court overturned the order of the washington court of appeals and reinstated the trial courts damage award of 771 million against the company the damage award and statutory interest was fully paid as of december 31 2021 refer to the commitments and contingencies footnote in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

additionally we are subject to numerous laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate as well as governmental regulations relating to taxes environmental protection product quality standards data privacy building and zoning requirements and employment law matters if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees 

and costs in addition our capital expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations 

general risks 

we are subject to risks related to corporate social responsibility and reputation 

many factors influence our reputation and the value of our brands including the perception held by our customers business partners investors other key stakeholders and the communities in which we do business our business faces increasing scrutiny related to environmental social and governance activities and disclosures and risk of damage to our reputation and the value of our brands if we fail to act responsibly in a number of areas such as environmental stewardship supply chain management climate change diversity equity and inclusion workplace conduct human rights philanthropy and support for local communities any harm to our reputation could impact employee engagement and retention and the willingness of customers and our partners to do business with us which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could affect our financial results or financial condition 

gaap and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business such as revenue recognition asset impairment impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets inventories lease obligations selfinsurance vendor allowances tax matters and litigation are complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments changes in accounting standards or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition the implementation of new accounting standards could also require certain systems internal process and other changes that could increase our operating costs 

our stock price is subject to fluctuations and the value of your investment may decline 

the trading price of our common stock is subject to fluctuations and may be subject to fluctuations in the future based upon external economic and market conditions the stock market in general has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that sometimes have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of listed companies these broad market geopolitical and industry factors among others may harm the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance and growth outlook and the value of your investment may decline

covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic continues to impact various aspects of our business and the longterm impact to our business remains unknown during the year ended december 31 2021 our business and results of operations continued to improve relative to the same period of 2020 in particular as widespread vaccine distribution continued we have seen economic recovery in many of the markets where we operate and a significant uptick in consumer mobility however all regions in which we operate continue to experience periodic surges in infection rates as a result our business segments continue to face many uncertainties and our operations remain vulnerable to continuing negative effects caused by the pandemic however we are encouraged to see the impact of the pandemic subsiding as evidenced by the improving industrial economy increase in miles driven and overall consumer activity 

as of december 31 2021 all our operations are open for business our supply chain partners have been very supportive and accommodating despite strains on the supply chain caused by labor shortages inventory shortages delays in order fulfillment and increased backlogs this has allowed us to continue to provide quality customer service we remain in constant communication with our employees regarding changing conditions and protocol based on the length and severity of the pandemic we may experience continued volatility in customer demand and supply chain disruption we will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of these potential impacts to our business consolidated results of operations segment results liquidity and capital resources 

key business metrics 

we consider comparable sales to be a key business metric because management has evaluated its results of operations using this metric and we believe that this key indicator provides additional perspective and insights when analyzing the operating performance of our business from period to period and trends in its historical operating results this metric should not be considered superior to as a substitute for or as an alternative to and should be considered in conjunction with the gaap financial measures presented in this report 

comparable sales 

comparable sales is a key metric that refer to periodoverperiod comparisons of our net sales excluding the impact of acquisitions divestitures foreign currency and other we consider this metric useful to investors because it provides greater transparency into management’s view and assessment of our core ongoing operations this metric is widely used by analysts investors and competitors in our industry although our calculation of the metric may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies because not all companies and analysts calculate this metric in the same manner

operating margins 

the company targets continuous operating margin improvement each year in 2020 we took certain restructuring actions across its subsidiaries to simplify our cost structure and distribution networks the 2019 cost savings plan we recognized permanent expense reductions of 150 million driven by transformative reductions in payroll and facility costs additionally we had approximately 300 million in temporary savings in response to the impact of covid19 these actions led to improved segment margins in 2020 and permanently lowered our cost structure as business normalized in 2021 the temporary savings ended and we experienced cost increases in areas such as wages freight and health insurance despite these challenges we improved segment margins 60 basis points by leveraging strong topline growth improving gross margins through pricing and sourcing actions and managing costs through ongoing strategic initiatives we believe continued execution of our strategic priorities in 2022 will further improve our margins

results of operations 

our results of operations are summarized below for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 



net sales 

consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31 2021 totaled 189 billion up 141 from 2020 the increase in net sales is due to a 105 comparable sales increase the favorable impact of foreign currency and other of 21 and a 15 positive impact from acquisitions 

the companys comparable sales growth reflects both an increase in sales volume and product inflation as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 higher sales volume was driven primarily by the increase in consumer activity associated with the reopening of our key markets and the execution of our strategic growth initiatives throughout the year additionally sales were positively impacted by price inflation of approximately 3 for the year ended december 31 2021 with our global growth initiatives and strong industry fundamentals we believe we are well positioned for both nearterm and sustainable longterm sales growth 

automotive group 

net sales for the automotive group “automotive” were 125 billion in 2021 a 155 increase from 2020 the increase in sales consists of an approximate 110 increase in comparable sales a 25 favorable impact of currency translation and other and a 20 contribution from acquisitions foreign currency translation was positively impacted by our automotive businesses across all regions 

in 2021 total automotive revenues were up approximately 143 in the first quarter up 281 in the second quarter up 82 in the third quarter and up 131 in the fourth quarter all periods reflect a strong recovery from the decline in demand caused by covid19 in 2020 we remain optimistic that our automotive sales trends will continue to show positive growth as the global markets fully recover positive trends related to the overall number and age of the vehicle population and the continued improvement in miles driven remain supportive of sustained demand for automotive aftermarket maintenance and supply items across the markets we serve we expect these fundamentals and our ongoing sales initiatives to drive sales growth for the automotive group in 2022 

industrial parts group 

net sales for the industrial parts group “industrial” were 63 billion in 2021 up 114 from 2020 the increase in sales reflects a 97 increase in comparable sales a 13 favorable impact of currency translation and an approximate 04 contribution from acquisitions 

in 2021 total industrial revenues were up approximately 01 in the first quarter of 2021 up 196 in the second quarter up 145 in the third quarter and up 128 in the fourth quarter these quarterly results reflect the positive impact of key sales initiatives the ongoing industrial recovery and broad increase in customer productivity which correlate to the improvement in industrial indicators such as the purchasing managers index and industrial production we are confident in our growth plans for 2022 both in north america and australasia and expect to see continued improvement in our sales trends 

cost of goods sold 

the company includes in cost of goods sold the actual cost of merchandise which represents the vast majority of this line item other items in cost of goods sold include warranty costs and inbound freight from the suppliers net of any vendor allowances and incentives 

cost of goods sold was 122 billion in 2021 a 124 increase from 109 billion in 2020 as a percentage of net sales cost of goods sold was 648 in 2021 decreasing from 658 of net sales in 2020 the decrease in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales in 2021 reflects the favorable impact of increased supplier incentives business unit channel and product mix shifts and strategic category management initiatives in areas such as pricing and global sourcing in 2021 compared to 2020 

operating expenses 

the company includes in selling administrative and other expenses “sga” all personnel and personnelrelated costs at its headquarters distribution centers stores and branches which accounts for more than 60 of total sga additional costs in sga include our facilities delivery marketing advertising technology digital legal and professional costs 

sga of 52 billion in 2021 increased by 08 billion or approximately 177 from 2020 this represents 274 of net sales in 2021 compared to 265 of net sales in 2020 the increase in sga as a percent of net sales primarily reflects a 774 million charge related to damages in connection with a 2017 automotive product liability claim and a 611 million loss on a software disposal in addition we had the headwind of more than 300 million in temporary covid19 related cost savings in 2020 the increase in sga was partially offset by the leveraging of expenses on strong sales and our initiatives to improve operational efficiencies and optimize the productivity of our distribution network 

depreciation and amortization expense was 2910 million in 2021 an increase of approximately 181 million or 66 from 2020 due to an increase in capital investments to improve our distribution facilities streamline our supply chain and invest in technology solutions the provision for doubtful accounts was 177 million in 2021 a 58 million decrease from 2020 reflecting the improved financial health of our customers as our key markets recover from the covid19 pandemic we believe the company is adequately reserved for bad debts and credit losses at december 31 2021 

goodwill impairment 

due to several factors that coalesced in the second quarter of 2020 we performed an interim impairment test as of may 31 2020 for our european reporting unit and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 5067 million these factors primarily resulted from the ongoing market volatility and uncertainty caused by the covid19 pandemic which extended into the second quarter of 2020 and impacted several critical impairment testing assumptions including weighted average cost of capital and market multiples and nearterm revenue and operating margin projections for the reporting unit refer to the goodwill and other intangible assets footnote within the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information if there are sustained declines in macroeconomic or business conditions in future periods including as a result of the continued covid19 pandemic affecting the projected earnings and cash flows at our reporting units among other things there can be no assurance that goodwill at one or more reporting units may not be impaired as of december 31 2021 we determined that there were no indicators that goodwill was impaired at any of our reporting units 

nonoperating expenses and income 

nonoperating expenses included net interest expense of 622 million in 2021 and 910 million in 2020 the decrease in net interest expense of 289 million in 2021 primarily reflects the combination of the repayment of debt and lowered interest rates on our remaining outstanding debt 

“other” includes equity method investment income investment dividends noncontrolling interests and pension income other income in 2021 was 996 million an approximate 441 million increase from the prior year due to a variety of factors including favorable changes in gains on equity investments and retirement plan valuations 

segment profit 

segment profit is calculated as net sales less operating expenses excluding general corporate expenses net interest expense equity in income from investees intangible asset amortization income attributable to noncontrolling interests and other unallocated amounts that are primarily driven by corporate initiatives and adjusted in nongaap measures as described further below refer to the segment data footnote in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

automotive group 

automotives segment profit increased 237 in 2021 from 2020 and segment profit margin was 86 in 2021 compared to 80 in 2020 the improvement reflects strong operating results across our geographies resulting from doubledigit organic sales growth gross margin expansion and ongoing cost control actions to further improve automotives segment margin this group will continue to execute on its growth plans and cost initiatives going forward 

industrial group 

industrial’s segment profit increased 235 in 2021 from 2020 and segment profit margin improved to 94 an increase from 85 in 2020 the improvement primarily reflects the benefits of doubledigit organic sales growth and improved gross margin and operational efficiencies we believe the strength of economic indicators such as industrial production and the purchasing managers index combined with effective growth initiatives and cost actions position the industrial group for further growth in 2022 

income taxes 

the companys effective income tax rate was 251 as of december 31 2021 compared to 569 in 2020 for the year ended december 31 2021 the rate decrease is primarily due to the nondeductible goodwill impairment charge that occurred in 2020 

net income from continuing operations 

net income from continuing operations was 8988 million in 2021 a significant increase compared to 1634 million in 2020 on a per share diluted basis net income from continuing operations was 623 in 2021 up 4513 compared to 113 in 2020 net income from continuing operations was 48 of net sales in 2021 compared to 10 of net sales in 2020 the increase in net income from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 

2021 primarily reflects the goodwill impairment charge of 5067 million that occurred during the second quarter of 2020 

adjusted net income from continuing operations was 9970 million in 2021 an increase of 303 from 7650 million in 2020 on a per share diluted basis adjusted net income from continuing operations was 691 a 311 increase compared to adjusted net income per diluted share from continuing operations of 527 in 2020

the following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income from continuing operations and diluted net income from continuing operations per common share to adjusted net income from continuing operations and adjusted diluted net income from continuing operations per common share to account for the impact of adjustments the company believes that the presentation of adjusted net income from continuing operations and adjusted diluted net income from continuing operations per common share which are not calculated in accordance with gaap when considered together with the corresponding gaap financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the companys core operations the company considers these metrics useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management’s view and assessment of the company’s ongoing operating performance by removing items management believes are not representative of our continuing operations and may distort our longerterm operating trends we believe these measures to be useful to enhance the comparability of our results from period to period and with our competitors as well as to show ongoing results from operations distinct from items that are infrequent or not associated with the company’s core operations the company does not nor does it suggest investors should consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for gaap financial information

financial condition 

the company’s cash balance at december 31 2021 was 7147 million compared to cash of 9902 million at december 31 2020 for the year ended december 31 2021 the company used 1607 million to pay down debt net of proceeds 4656 million for dividends paid to the company’s shareholders 3336 million for the repurchase of the companys common stock 2661 million for investments in the company via capital expenditures and 2843 million for acquisitions and other investing activities these items were offset by the company’s earnings and net cash provided by operating activities 

accounts receivable increased 2410 million or 155 from december 31 2020 primarily due to higher sales volume inventory increased 3836 million or 109 from december 31 2020 in association with higher product demand and increase in sales accounts payable increased 6769 million or 164 from december 31 2020 due to the increase in purchases related to sales volume and extended payment terms with certain suppliers total debt of 24 billion at december 31 2021 decreased 2678 million or 100 from december 31 2020 primarily due to the pay down of our shortterm debt and foreign currency impact during the year 

we continue to negotiate extended payment dates with our suppliers our current payment terms with the majority of our suppliers range from 30 to 360 days several global financial institutions offer voluntary supply chain finance scf programs which enable our suppliers generally those that grant extended terms at their sole discretion to sell their receivables from the company to these financial institutions on a nonrecourse basis at a rate that takes advantage of our credit rating and may be beneficial to them the scf program is primarily available to suppliers of goods and services included in cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of income the company and our suppliers agree on commercial terms for the goods and services we procure including prices quantities and payment terms regardless of whether the supplier elects to participate in the scf program the suppliers sell goods or services as applicable to the company and they issue the associated invoices to the company based on the agreedupon contractual terms then if they are participating in the scf program our suppliers at their sole discretion determine which invoices if any they want to sell to the financial institutions in turn we direct payment to the financial institutions rather than the suppliers for the invoices sold to the financial institutions no guarantees are provided by the company or any of our subsidiaries on thirdparty performance under the scf program however the company guarantees the payment by our subsidiaries to the financial institutions participating in the scf program for the applicable invoices we have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to participate in the scf program and we have no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions as it relates to the scf program accordingly amounts due to our suppliers that elected to participate in the scf program are included in the line item accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets all activity related to amounts due to suppliers that elected to participate in the scf program is reflected in cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows we have been informed by the financial institutions that as of december 31 2021 and 2020 suppliers elected to sell 27 billion and 18 billion respectively of our outstanding payment obligations to the financial institutions the amount settled through the scf program was 32 billion for the year ended december 31 2021 

liquidity and capital resources 

the company’s sources of capital consist primarily of cash flows from operations supplemented as necessary by private and public issuances of debt and bank borrowings currently we believe that our cash on hand and available shortterm and longterm sources of capital are sufficient to fund the company’s operations in both the short and long term including working capital requirements scheduled debt payments interest payments capital expenditures benefit plan contributions income tax obligations dividends share repurchases and contemplated acquisitions 

the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 118 to 1 at december 31 2021 and 121 to 1 at 2020 and our liquidity position remains strong the company’s total debt outstanding at december 31 2021 decreased by 2678 million or 100 from december 31 2020 primarily due to the pay down of our shortterm debt and foreign currency impact during the year 

sources and uses of cash 

a summary of the company’s consolidated statements of cash flows is as follows 



operating activities 

the company continues to generate positive cash flow and in 2021 net cash provided by operating activities totaled 13 billion a 08 billion or 375 decrease from 2020 the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by the 800 million benefit to operating cash flow in 2020 for the ar sales agreement to sell receivables 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 5062 million in 2021 compared to net cash provided by investing activities of 1828 million in 2020 a 6889 million or 3769 decrease in 2021 net cash used in investing activities included capital expenditures of 2661 million an increase of 1126 million or 734 from the prior year and 2843 million used for acquisitions of businesses and other investing activities an increase of 2151 million or 3110 from 2020 these items were partially offset by 177 million in proceeds from the divestitures down 3696 million or 954 primarily due to the sale of the business products group in 2020 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities in 2021 totaled 10 billion a decrease of 05 billion or 346 from the 15 billion in cash used in financing activities in 2020 the decrease is primarily due to the 1607 million pay down of debt net of proceeds in 2021 relative to the 8950 million pay down of debt net of proceeds in 2020 which was partially offset by an additional 2374 million in repurchases of our common stock as compared to 2020 for 2021 the companys financing activities included dividends paid to shareholders of 4656 million and repurchases of the companys common stock of 3336 million the company expects this trend of increasing dividends to continue in the foreseeable future we also expect to remain active in our share repurchase program but the amount and value of shares repurchased will vary and is at the discretion of the companys board of directors 

notes and other borrowings 

the company ended the year with 22 billion of total liquidity comprising 15 billion availability on the revolving credit facility and 07 billion of cash and cash equivalents from time to time the company may enter into other credit facilities or financing arrangements to provide additional liquidity and to manage against foreign currency risk the company currently believes that the existing lines of credit and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund anticipated operations for the foreseeable future 

on september 30 2021 we entered into the first amendment to the syndicated facility agreement the unsecured revolving credit facility dated as of october 30 2020 the interest rates were amended to reduce the applicable rate by 125 basis points resulting in a rate of libor  1125 basis points and the libor floor from 05 to 00 the amendment also extended the maturity by one year to september 30 2026 

at december 31 2021 approximately 15 billion was available under this line of credit due to the workers’ compensation and insurance reserve requirements in certain states the company also had unused letters of credit of approximately 728 million outstanding at december 31 2021 our unused letters of credit expire within one year but have automatic renewal clauses 

at december 31 2021 the company had 24 billion of unsecured senior notes outstanding approximately 19 billion of these borrowings contain covenants related to a maximum debt to ebitda ratio and certain limitations on additional borrowings the weighted average interest rate on the company’s total outstanding borrowings was approximately 235 at december 31 2021 and 265 at december 31 2020 total interest expense net of interest income for all borrowings was 622 million and 910 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively refer to the debt footnote in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 

at december 31 2021 the company was in compliance with the covenants under our unsecured revolving credit facility and our outstanding unsecured senior notes any failure to comply with our debt covenants or 

restrictions could result in a default under our financing arrangements or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions the occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could create cross defaults under other debt arrangements and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

on january 3 2022 we amended our ar sales agreement to increase the facility limit by an additional 200 million bringing the total to 10 billion the terms of the ar sales agreement limit the balance of receivables sold to approximately 10 billion at any point in time refer to the ar sales agreement footnote in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 

on january 6 2022 we issued 500000 aggregate principal amount of unsecured 1750 senior notes due 2025 at a price to the public of 99721 of their face value with us bank national association as trustee interest on the 1750 senior notes due 2025 is payable semiannually on february 1 and august 1 of each year beginning on august 1 2022 and is computed on the basis of a 360day year simultaneously on january 6 2022 the company issued 500000 aggregate principal amount of unsecured 2750 senior notes due 2032 at a price to the public of 98810 of their face value with us bank national association as trustee interest on the 2750 senior notes due 2032 is payable semiannually on february 1 and august 1 of each year beginning on august 1 2022 and is computed on the basis of a 360day year 

contractual and other obligations 

the following table summarizes our material cash requirements at december 31 2021 that we expect to be paid in cash the table does not include amounts that are contingent on events or other factors that are uncertain or unknown at this time including legal contingencies and uncertain tax positions the amounts presented are based on various estimates and actual results may vary from the amounts presented 



purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in our estimates we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual cash requirement as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements our purchase orders are based on our current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons the company does not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements 

additionally the company guarantees the borrowings of certain independently owned automotive parts stores independents and certain other affiliates in which the company has a noncontrolling equity ownership interest affiliates the company’s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these independents and affiliates is generally equal to the total borrowings subject to the company’s guarantee at december 31 2021 the total borrowings of the independents and affiliates subject to guarantee by the company were approximately 9175 million these loans generally mature over periods from one to six years our amount of commitment expiring in 2022 is approximately 3046 million to date the company has had no significant losses in connection with guarantees of independents’ and affiliates’ borrowings 

share repurchases 

in 2021 the company repurchased approximately 26 million shares of its common stock and the company had remaining authority to purchase approximately 119 million shares of its common stock at december 31 2021 there were no other repurchase plans announced as of december 31 2021 

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we describe in this section certain critical accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates assumptions and judgments an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially impact the consolidated financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for further information on the critical accounting policies see the summary of significant accounting policies footnote in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

inventories — provisions for slow moving and obsolescence 

the company identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates appropriate provisions related thereto historically these losses have not been significant as the vast majority of the company’s inventories are not highly susceptible to obsolescence and a majority are eligible for return under various vendor return programs while the company has no reason to believe its inventory return privileges will be discontinued in the future its risk of loss associated with obsolete or slow moving inventories would increase if such were to occur 

allowance for doubtful accounts — methodology 

the company evaluates the collectability of trade accounts receivable based on a combination of factors the company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on various factors including historical experience current economic conditions and expected future credit losses and collectability trends the company periodically adjusts this estimate when the company becomes aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations eg bankruptcy filing or as a result of changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable while the company has a large customer base that is geographically dispersed a general economic downturn in any of the industry segments in which the company operates could result in higher than expected defaults and therefore the need to revise estimates for bad debts for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 the company recorded provisions for doubtful accounts of approximately 177 million 236 million and 139 million respectively 

consideration received from vendors 

the company may enter into agreements at the beginning of each year with many of its vendors that provide for inventory purchase incentives generally the company earns inventory purchase incentives upon achieving specified volume purchasing levels or other criteria the company accrues for the receipt of these incentives as part of its inventory cost based on cumulative purchases of inventory to date and projected inventory purchases through the end of the year while management believes the company will continue to receive consideration from vendors in 2022 and beyond there can be no assurance that vendors will continue to provide comparable amounts of incentives in the future or that we will be able to achieve the specified volumes necessary to take advantage of such incentives 

impairment of property plant and equipment and goodwill and other intangible assets 

at least annually the company evaluates property plant and equipment goodwill and other intangible assets for potential impairment indicators the company’s judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance among other factors future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired evaluating for impairment also requires the company to estimate future operating results and cash flows which requires judgment by management any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and results of operations refer to the goodwill and other intangible assets footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on the results of the companys annual goodwill impairment testing 

employee benefit plans 

the company’s benefit plan committees in the us and canada establish investment policies and strategies and regularly monitor the performance of the company’s pension plan assets the plans in europe are unfunded and therefore there are no plan assets the pension plan investment strategy implemented by the company’s management is to achieve longterm objectives and invest the pension assets in accordance with the applicable pension legislation in the us and canada as well as fiduciary standards the longterm primary objectives for the pension plan funds are to provide for a reasonable amount of longterm growth of capital without undue exposure to risk protect the assets from erosion of purchasing power and provide investment results that meet or exceed the pension plans’ actuarially assumed longterm rates of return the company’s investment strategy with respect to pension plan assets is to generate a return in excess of the passive portfolio benchmark 38 us largecap stocks 9 us midcap stocks 10 international stocks 3 emerging market stocks and 40 barclays us govcredit index 

we make several critical assumptions in determining our pension plan assets and liabilities and related pension income we believe the most critical of these assumptions are the expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate other assumptions we make relate to employee demographic factors such as rate of compensation increases mortality rates retirement patterns and turnover rates refer to the employee benefit plans footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding these assumptions 

based on the investment policy for the pension plans as well as an asset study that was performed based on the company’s asset allocations and future expectations the company’s expected rate of return on plan assets for measuring 2022 pension income is 634 for the plans the asset study forecasted expected rates of return for the approximate duration of the company’s benefit obligations using capital market data and historical relationships 

the discount rate is chosen as the rate at which pension obligations could be effectively settled and is based on capital market conditions as of the measurement date we have matched the timing and duration of the expected cash flows of our pension obligations to a yield curve generated from a broad portfolio of highquality fixed income debt instruments to select our discount rate based upon this cash flow matching analysis we selected a weighted average discount rate for the plans of 304 at december 31 2021 

our pension income for 2021 is determined at the december 31 2020 measurement date a 25 basis point increase in discount rate would result in an approximate 73 million decrease on our projected benefit obligation a 25 basis point decrease in discount rate would result in approximate 77 million increase on our projected benefit obligation a 25 basis point change in discount rate would have an approximate 12 million impact on our pension income a 25 basis point change in expected return on asset would have an approximate 57 million impact on our pension income these sensitivities reflect the effect of changing one assumption at a time and assume no changes to the design of the pension plans 

effective december 31 2013 our defined benefit pension plans were amended to freeze benefit plan accruals for participants and provide for immediate vesting of accrued benefits net periodic benefit income for our defined benefit pension plans was 193 million 180 million and 162 million for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively the income associated with the pension plans in 2021 2020 and 2019 reflects the impact of the freeze refer to the employee benefit plans footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding employee benefit plans 

business combinations 

when the company acquires businesses it applies the acquisition method of accounting and recognizes the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree at their fair values on the acquisition date which requires significant estimates and assumptions goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed the acquisition method requires the company to record provisional amounts for any items for which the accounting is not complete at the end of a reporting period the company must complete the accounting during the measurement period which cannot exceed one year adjustments made during the measurement period could have a material impact on the companys financial condition and results of operations 

the company typically measures customer relationship and other intangible assets using an income approach significant estimates and assumptions used in this approach include discount rates and certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted cash flows expected to be generated from the asset eg future revenue growth rates operating margins and attrition rates if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values the company could record impairment charges in addition the company has estimated the 

economic lives of certain acquired tangible and intangible assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense if the companys estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could be increased or decreased or the acquired asset could be impaired 

legal and product liabilities 

the company accrues for potential losses related to legal disputes litigation product liabilities and regulatory matters when it is probable the future event or events are likely to occur that the company will incur a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 

to calculate product liabilities the company estimates potential losses relating to pending claims and also estimates the likelihood of additional similar claims being filed against the company in the future to estimate potential losses on claims that could be filed in the future the company considers claims pending against the company claim filing rates the number of codefendants and the extent to which they share in settlements and the amount of loss by claim type the estimated losses for pending and potential future claims are calculated on a discounted basis using riskfree interest rates derived from market data about monetary assets with maturities comparable to those of the projected product liabilities the company uses an actuarial specialist to assist with measuring its product liabilities refer to the commitments and contingencies footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding product liabilities 

self insurance 

the company is selfinsured for the majority of its group health insurance costs a reserve for claims incurred but not reported is developed by analyzing historical claims data provided by the company’s claims administrators these reserves are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as the expenses are expected to be paid within one year 

longterm insurance liabilities consist primarily of reserves for the companys workers’ compensation program in addition the company carries various large risk deductible workers’ compensation policies for the majority of workers’ compensation liabilities the company records the workers’ compensation reserves based on an analysis performed by an independent actuary the analysis calculates development factors which are applied to total reserves as provided by the various insurance companies who underwrite the program while the company believes that the assumptions used to calculate these liabilities are appropriate significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect workers’ compensation costs 

income taxes 

the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amount and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded net as noncurrent deferred income taxes in addition valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized in making this determination the company considers all available positive and negative evidence including projected future taxable income future reversals of existing temporary differences recent financial operations and tax planning strategies 

the company recognizes a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits

 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  

although the company does not face material risks related to commodity prices the company is exposed to changes in interest rates and in foreign currency rates with respect to foreign currency denominated operating revenues and expenses 

foreign currency 

the company incurs translation gains or losses resulting from the translation of an operating unit’s foreign functional currency into us dollars for consolidated financial statement purposes for the periods presented the company’s principal foreign currency exchange exposures are the euro the functional currency of our european operations the canadian dollar the functional currency of our canadian operations and the australian dollar the 

functional currency of our australasian operations we monitor our foreign currency exposures and from time to time we enter into currency forward contracts to manage our exposure to currency fluctuations foreign currency exchange exposure particularly in regard to the australian and canadian dollar and to a lesser extent the euro positively impacted our results for the year ended december 31 2021 foreign currency exchange exposure particularly in regard to the euro positively impacted our results for the year ended december 31 2020 this positive impact was mostly offset by the negative impact from the canadian and australian dollar for the full year ended december 31 2020 

during 2021 and 2020 it was estimated that a 10 shift in exchange rates between those foreign functional currencies and the us dollar would have impacted translated net sales by approximately 683 million and 549 million respectively a 15 shift in exchange rates between those functional currencies and the us dollar would have impacted translated net sales by approximately 10 billion in 2021 and 824 million in 2020 a 20 shift in exchange rates between those functional currencies and the us dollar would have impacted translated net sales by approximately 14 billion in 2021 and 11 billion in 2020 

interest rates 

the company is subject to interest rate volatility with regard to existing and future issuances of debt we monitor our mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt as well as our mix of shortterm debt and longterm debt from time to time we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations as of december 31 2021 we primarily had fixedrate debt based on the companys variablerate debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of december 31 2021 and 2020 we estimate that a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have an immaterial impact in 2021 and would have increased interest expense by 11 million in 2020 however this increase in interest expense would have been partially offset by the increases in interest income related to higher interest rates

forwardlooking statements are only as of the date they are made and the company undertakes no duty to update its forwardlooking statements except as required by law you are advised however to review any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our subsequent forms 10q 8k and other reports filed with the sec 

set forth below are the material risks and uncertainties that if they were to occur could materially and adversely affect our business or could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements in this report and in the other public statements we make please be aware that these risks may change over time and other risks may prove to be important in the future new risks may emerge at any time and we cannot predict such risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our business financial condition results of operations or the trading price of our securities 

strategic and operational risks 

the impact of the covid19 pandemic has significantly impacted worldwide economic conditions and our operations and our financial results have been and will in the future be materially adversely impacted and the duration and extent to which it will impact our business remains uncertain 

covid19 a novel strain of coronavirus was reported in december 2019 with the world health organization declaring it a global pandemic on march 11 2020 the covid19 pandemic has created significant volatility uncertainty and disruption with severe impacts on the united states and global economies the covid19 pandemic has impacted a large portion of the world including our domestic and international operations if the pandemic continues to create disruptions or turmoil in the credit or financial markets or impacts our credit ratings it could adversely affect our ability to access capital on favorable terms or at all meet our liquidity needs or amend andor refinance our existing credit arrangements 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic impacts the company will depend on numerous factors and future developments that we cannot predict including the severity of the virus the occurrence of additional waves or spikes in infection rates the duration of the outbreak governmental business or other actions taken in response to the pandemic and the efficacy of these actions including partial or complete shut downs travel restrictions and stayathome orders among other actions the effectiveness and distribution of covid19 vaccines and impacts on our supply chain our ability to keep operating locations open and on customer demand 

as the pandemic continues to spread throughout the united states consumer fears about covid19 continue and recommendations andor mandates from federal state and local authorities to avoid large gatherings of people or selfquarantine have persisted andor increased which has and will continue to adversely affect our operations we have incurred and continue to incur additional costs related to efforts to protect the health and wellbeing of our team members customers and the communities we serve we expect to continue to incur additional costs which may be significant as we continue to implement operational changes in response to this pandemic 

we may further restrict the operations of our various distribution centers branches or store facilities in both of our segments if we deem such action necessary or appropriate or if recommended or mandated by local government authorities additionally we may incur significant incremental costs to ensure we meet the needs of our customers and our employees including additional cleanings of our stores and other facilities also if we do not respond appropriately to the pandemic or if customers do not perceive our response to be adequate or appropriate for a particular region or the company as a whole we could suffer damage to our reputation and our brand which could adversely affect our business in the future these items could have a further material impact on our sales and profits and could lead to significantly higher losses on outstanding customer receivables guaranteed loans and asset impairment charges among other things 

the covid19 pandemic has resulted in work and travel restrictions and delays which have been expanded throughout the continued progression of the pandemic these restrictions and delays have impacted and may continue to impact suppliers and manufacturers of certain of our products this may make it difficult for our suppliers to source and manufacture products in and to export our products from affected areas as a result we may continue to face delays or difficulty sourcing certain products these supply chain disruptions as well as associated labor shortages within the supply chain could cause inventory shortages delays in order fulfillment and increased backlogs and we may be unable to meet our customers’ expectations and requirements as result which could negatively affect our business and financial results even if we are able to find alternate sources for such products they may cost more which could adversely impact our profitability and financial condition 

additional adverse changes in economic conditions as a result of the pandemic may also lead to increased credit concerns and challenges to recover accounts receivable reduced liquidity adverse impacts on our suppliers and customers including on their abilities to continue to operate as a going concern 

further the company and management are focused on mitigating the impact of the covid19 pandemic which has required and will continue to require a large investment of time and resources and may delay other strategic initiatives additionally many of our employees are working remotely and may continue to do so for an extended period an extended period of remote work arrangements could strain our business continuity plans introduce operational risk including but not limited to our ability to manage our business cybersecurity and data security risks the potential vulnerabilities to our financial reporting systems and our internal control environment and the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 

due to the unprecedented nature of covid19 and the myriad of responses thereto we cannot identify all of the risks we face from the pandemic and its resulting impacts even after the pandemic has subsided we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of any economic recession that has occurred or may occur the pandemic could also amplify other risks and uncertainties described in our 2019 annual report on form 10k the ultimate adverse impacts relating to the potential effect of the covid19 pandemic on our business and the costs that we may incur as a result cannot be reasonably estimated but could be material 

our business will be adversely affected if demand for our products slows 

our business depends on customer demand for the products that we distribute demand for these products depends on many factors 

with respect to our automotive group the primary factors are 

• the number of miles vehicles are driven annually as higher vehicle mileage increases the need for maintenance and repair 

• the number of vehicles in the automotive fleet a function of new vehicle sales and vehicle scrappage rates as a steady or growing total vehicle population supports the continued demand for maintenance and repair 

• the quality of the vehicles manufactured by the original vehicle manufacturers and the length of the warranty or maintenance offered on new vehicles 

• the number of vehicles in current service that are six years old and older as these vehicles are typically no longer under the original vehicle manufacturers’ warranty and will need more maintenance and repair than newer vehicles 

• the addition of electric vehicles hybrid vehicles ride sharing services alternative transportation means and autonomously driven vehicles and future legislation related thereto 

• gas prices as increases in gas prices may deter consumers from using their vehicles 

• changes in travel patterns which may cause consumers to rely more on other transportation 

• restrictions on access to diagnostic tools and repair information imposed by the original vehicle manufacturers or by governmental regulation as consumers may be forced to have all diagnostic work repairs and maintenance performed by the vehicle manufacturers’ dealer networks and 

• the economy generally which in declining conditions may cause consumers to defer vehicle maintenance and repair and defer discretionary spending 

with respect to our industrial parts group the primary factors are 

• the level of industrial production and manufacturing capacity utilization as these indices reflect the need for industrial replacement parts 

• changes in manufacturing reflected in the level of the institute for supply management’s purchasing managers index as an index reading of 50 or more implies an expanding manufacturing economy while a reading below 50 implies a contracting manufacturing economy 

• the consolidation of certain of our manufacturing customers and the trend of manufacturing operations being moved overseas which subsequently reduces demand for our products 

• changes in legislation or government regulations or policies which could impact international trade among our multinational customer base and cause reduced demand for our products and 

• the economy in general which in declining conditions may cause reduced demand for industrial output 

we depend on our relationships with our suppliers and a disruption of these relationships or of our suppliers’ operations could harm our business 

as a distributor of automotive and industrial parts our business depends on developing and maintaining close and productive relationships with our suppliers we depend on our suppliers to sell us quality products at favorable prices a variety of factors many outside our control affect our suppliers ability to deliver quality merchandise to us at favorable prices and in a timely manner these include raw material shortages inadequate manufacturing capacity labor strikes shortages and disputes anywhere within the supply and distribution chain delivering products to us tariff and customs legislation and enforcement transportation disruptions tax and other legislative uncertainties pandemics including the current covid19 pandemic andor weather conditions since the beginning of the covid19 pandemic we have experienced supply chain disruptions particularly with regard to labor shortages in the us and inventory sourced from china these disruptions have not had a material impact on our business to date but we cannot provide any assurance that these or new supply chain disruptions will not materially or adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations in the future 

furthermore financial or operational difficulties at a particular supplier could cause that supplier to increase the cost or decrease the quality of the products we purchase supplier consolidation could also limit the number of suppliers from which we may purchase products and could materially affect the prices we pay for these products in addition we would suffer an adverse impact if our suppliers limit or cancel the return privileges that currently protect us from inventory obsolescence 

we face substantial competition in the industries in which we do business 

the sale of automotive and industrial parts is highly competitive and impacted by many factors including name recognition product availability customer service changing customer preferences store location and pricing pressures because we seek to offer competitive prices we may be forced to reduce our prices if our competitors reduce their prices which could result in a material decline in our revenues and earnings increased competition among distributors of automotive and industrial parts including increased availability among digital and ecommerce providers across the markets in which we do business could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations the company anticipates no decline in competition in any of its business segments in the foreseeable future 

in particular the market for replacement automotive parts is highly competitive and subjects us to a wide variety of competitors we compete primarily with national international and regional auto parts chains independently owned regional and local automotive parts and accessories stores automobile dealers that supply manufacturer replacement parts and accessories mass merchandisers internet providers and wholesale clubs that sell automotive products and regional and local full service automotive repair shops both new and established 

furthermore the automotive aftermarket industry continues to experience consolidation consolidation among our competitors could further enhance their financial position provide them with the ability to offer more competitive prices to customers for whom we compete and allow them to achieve increased efficiencies in their consolidated operations that enable them to more effectively compete for customers if we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies or if our competitors develop more effective strategies we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

if we experience a security breach if our internal information systems fail to function properly or if we are unsuccessful in implementing integrating or upgrading our information systems our business operations could be materially affected 

we depend on information systems to process customer orders manage inventory and accounts receivable collections purchase products manage accounts payable processes ship products to customers on a timely basis maintain cost effective operations provide superior service to customers and accumulate financial results among many other things 

despite our implementation of various security measures our it systems and operations could be subject to damage or interruption from computer viruses natural disasters unauthorized physical or electronic access power outages telecommunications failure computer system or network failures wire transfer failure employee errormalfeasance cyberattacks security breaches and other similar disruptions additionally the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyberattacks and breaches of it systems change frequently and have the potential to not be recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time maintaining operating and protecting these systems and related personal information about our employees customers and suppliers requires continuous investments in physical and technological security measures employee training and thirdparty services which we have made and will continue to make a cyberattack or security breach could result in among other things sensitive and confidential data being lost manipulated or exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public or delay our ability to process customer orders and manage inventory while we also seek to obtain assurances from third parties with whom we interact to protect confidential information there are risks that the confidentiality or accessibility of data held or utilized by such third parties may be compromised 

a serious prolonged disruption of our information systems for any of the above reasons could materially impair fundamental business processes and increase expenses decrease sales or otherwise impact earnings and cash flows furthermore such a disruption may harm our reputation and business prospects and subject us to legal claims if there is loss disclosure or misappropriation of or access to our customers employees or suppliers information as the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and use and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous compliance with these requirements could also result in significant additional costs as threats related to cybersecurity breaches grow more sophisticated and frequent it may become more difficult to timely detect and protect our data and infrastructure 

we may not be able to successfully implement our business initiatives in each of our business segments to grow our sales and earnings which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have implemented numerous initiatives in each of our business segments to grow sales and earnings including the introduction of new and expanded product lines strategic acquisitions geographic expansion including through acquisitions sales to new markets enhanced customer marketing programs and a variety of gross margin and cost savings initiatives if we are unable to implement these initiatives efficiently and effectively or if these initiatives are unsuccessful our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

successful implementation of these initiatives also depends on factors specific to the automotive parts and industrial parts industries and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control in addition to the other risk factors contained in this “item 1a risk factors” adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our business initiatives and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

• the competitive environment in our end markets may force us to reduce prices below our desired pricing level or to increase promotional spending 

• our ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and to meet customers’ needs for our products in a timely manner 

• our ability to successfully enter new markets including by successfully identifying and acquiring suitable acquisition targets in these new markets 

• our ability to effectively manage our costs 

• our ability to continue to grow through acquisitions and successfully integrate acquired businesses in our existing operations including in particular the challenges associated with the integration of foreign operations to ensure the adequacy of internal controls 

• our ability to identify and successfully implement appropriate technological digital and ecommerce solutions 

• the rate of adoption of electric vehicles hybrid vehicles ride sharing services alternative transportation means and autonomously driven vehicles and future legislation related thereto 

• the occurrence of unusually severe weather events which can disrupt our operations forcing temporary closure of retail and distribution centers prohibiting shipment of inventory and products and negatively impact our results in the affected geographies 

• the occurrence of political unrest and strikes which can disrupt our operations and negatively impact our results in the affected geographies 

• volatility in oil prices which could have a negative impact on the global economy and the economy of each of the nations in which we operate in particular 

• the adequacy of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting and 

• the economy of each of the nations in which we operate in general including the monetary policies of the federal reserve which are influenced by various factors including inflation unemployment and shortterm and longterm changes in the international trade balance and the fiscal policies of the us government 

we recognize the growing demand for businesstobusiness and businesstocustomer ecommerce options and solutions and we could lose business if we fail to provide the ecommerce options and solutions our customers wish to use 

our retail and business customers increasingly demand convenient easytouse ecommerce tools as an option to conduct their business with us the success of our ecommerce platform depends on our ability to accurately identify the products to make available through our ecommerce platform and to provide and maintain an efficient online experience with the highest level of data security for our customers operating an ecommerce platform is a complex undertaking and exposes us to risks and difficulties frequently experienced by internetbased businesses included risks related to among other things our ability to support expand and develop our internet operations website mobile applications and software and related operational systems continuing to improve our ecommerce platform involves substantial investment of capital and resources increasing supply chain and distribution capabilities attracting developing and retaining qualified personnel with relevant subject matter expertise and effectively managing and improving the customer experience if we are unable to successfully provide the ecommerce solutions our retail and business customers desire we may lose existing customers and fail to attract new ones our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected as a result 

we are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key persons could harm our business 

our future success significantly depends on the continued services and performance of our key management personnel we believe our management team’s depth and breadth of experience in our industry is integral to executing our business plan we also will need to continue to attract motivate and retain other key personnel the loss of services of members of our senior management team or other key employees the inability to attract additional qualified personnel as needed or failure to plan for the succession of senior management and key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our strategic transactions involve risks which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions 

we regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions including mergers acquisitions investments alliances and other growth and market expansion strategies with the expectation that these transactions will result in increases in sales cost savings synergies and various other benefits assessing the viability and realizing the benefits of these transactions is subject to significant uncertainty and we face significant competition in pursuing strategically beneficially transactions pursuing strategic transactions is also a timeconsuming process that can involve significant expenses and management attention for each of our acquisitions we need to successfully integrate the target company’s products services associates and systems into our business 

operations integration can be a complex and timeconsuming process and if the integration is not fully successful or is delayed for a material period of time we may not achieve the anticipated synergies or benefits of the acquisition furthermore even if the target companies are successfully integrated the acquisitions may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated expose us to increased competition or challenges with respect to our products or services and expose us to additional liabilities any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets acquired in a strategic transaction may reduce our earnings in addition any investments we hold in other companies are subject to a risk of partial or total loss of our investment 

additionally we consider and enter into divestitures from time to time with the expectation that these transactions will result in increases in cost savings and various other benefits strategic divestitures are subject to uncertainty and can be a complex and timeconsuming process if the divestiture is not fully successful or is delayed for a material period of time or if we are unable to reinvest the proceeds of the divestiture in a manner consistent with our strategic objectives we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the divestiture 

if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis which could result in a loss of investor confidence and negatively impact our business results of operations financial condition and stock price 

effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial statements and to effectively prevent fraud however a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met there can be no assurance that all control issues or fraud will be detected as we continue to grow our business our internal controls continue to become more complex and require more resources further many of our employees are working remotely in response to the impact of the covid19 pandemic and may continue to do so for an extended period an extended period of remote work arrangements could introduce potential vulnerabilities to our financial reporting systems and our internal control environment and the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting any failure to maintain effective controls could prevent us from timely and reliably reporting financial results and may harm our operating results in addition if we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified report as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of each fiscal year end we may be exposed to negative publicity which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information any failure to maintain effective internal controls and any such resulting negative publicity may negatively affect our business and stock price 

additionally the existence of any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies would require management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and management may not be able to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in a timely manner the existence of any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could also result in errors in our financial statements that could require us to restate our financial statements cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause stockholders to lose confidence in our reported financial information all of which could materially and adversely affect us and the market price of our common stock 

macroeconomic industry and financial risks 

changes in legislation or government regulations or policies particularly those relating to taxation and international trade could have a significant impact on our results of operations 

our business is global so changes to existing international trade agreements blocking of foreign trade or imposition of tariffs on foreign goods could result in decreased revenues andor increases in pricing either of which could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows in future periods for instance the united states imposed section 232 tariffs on many imported products of steel and aluminum in march 2018 and expanded the tariffs to additional derivative products of steel and aluminum effective february 8 2020 the united states imposed section 301 tariffs on most imported products from china starting in july 2018 although the united states and china reached a phase one trade deal in january 2020 there was no phase two trade deal implemented and most of the tariffs imposed remain in place while uncertainty persists in the trade relationship between the two countries that impacts the global trade landscape 

in addition as a global business we are subject to taxation in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate changes in the tax laws of these jurisdictions or in the interpretation or enforcement of existing tax laws could subject our business to audits inquiries and legal challenges from taxing authorities and could reduce the benefit of tax structures previously implemented for our operations as a result we may incur additional costs including taxes and penalties for historical periods that may have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

uncertainty andor deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions domestically and globally including unemployment inflation or deflation changes in tax policies changes in energy costs uncertain credit markets or other economic conditions could have a negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our business and operating results have been and may in the future be adversely affected by uncertain global economic conditions including domestic outputs political uncertainty and unrest employment rates inflation or deflation changes in tax policies instability in credit markets declining consumer and business confidence fluctuating commodity prices interest rates volatile exchange rates and other challenges that could affect the global economy both our commercial and retail customers may experience deterioration of their financial resources which could result in existing or potential customers delaying or canceling plans to purchase our products our vendors could experience similar negative conditions which could impact their ability to fulfill their financial obligations to us future weakness in the global economy could adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our debt levels could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations 

we have an unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured senior notes which could have important consequences to our financial health for example our level of indebtedness could among other things 

• make it more difficult to satisfy our financial obligations including those relating to our unsecured revolving credit facility and our unsecured senior notes 

• increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions 

• limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes and opportunities in our industry which may place us at a competitive disadvantage 

• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows to service the principal and interest on the debt reducing the funds available for other business purposes such as working capital capital expenditures or other cash requirements 

• limit our ability to incur additional debt with acceptable terms and 

• expose us to fluctuations in interest rates 

the terms of our financing obligations include restrictions such as affirmative negative and financial covenants conditions on borrowing and subsidiary guarantees a failure to comply with these restrictions could result in a default under our financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions the occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we also guarantee the borrowings of certain independently owned automotive parts stores and certain other affiliates in which we have a noncontrolling equity ownership interest to date we have not experienced any significant losses in connection with these guarantees however if any of the borrowers under these guarantees experienced a default we may be required to satisfy their payment obligations in an amount that could be material 

in addition our indebtedness is rated by credit rating agencies our overall credit rating may be negatively impacted by deteriorating and uncertain credit markets or other factors that may or may not be within our control the interest rates on our unsecured revolving credit facility as well as any additional indebtedness we may incur in the future are impacted by our credit ratings accordingly any negative impact of our credit ratings or placement of our credit ratings on “review” or “watch” status could result in higher interest expense and could impact the terms of any additional indebtedness we incur in the future 

we may be adversely affected by changes in the method of determining the london interbank offered rate “libor” or the replacement of libor with an alternative reference rate for our variable rate loans derivative contracts and other financial assets and liabilities 

our business relies upon a large volume of loans derivative contracts and other financial instruments which are directly or indirectly dependent on libor to establish their interest rate andor value the uk financial conduct authority announced in 2017 that it would no longer compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 it is not possible to predict whether banks will continue to provide libor submissions to the administrator of libor whether libor rates will cease to be published or supported before or after 2021 or whether any additional reforms to libor may be enacted in the united kingdom or elsewhere it is expected that a transition away from the widespread use of libor to alternative rates is likely to occur during the next several years 

while we have established a working group consisting of key stakeholders from throughout the company to monitor developments relating to libor uncertainty and changes and to guide the company’s response the impact of these developments on our business and financial results is not yet known the transition from libor may cause us to incur increased costs and additional risk uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes in or other reforms to libor may adversely affect libor rates and the value of liborbased loans originated prior to 2021 if libor rates are no longer available any successor or replacement interest rates may perform differently which may affect our net interest income change our market risk profile and require changes to our risk pricing and hedging strategies we may also incur costs to reform existing derivative contracts and other financial instruments to which we are a party to address these 

differences in performance relative to libor or relative to adjustments made in other loans derivative contracts or financial instruments where we are a party any failure to adequately manage this transition could adversely impact our business results of operations and cash flows 

the uks exit from the european union “eu” will continue to have uncertain effects and could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

on january 31 2020 the uk exited from the eu commonly referred to as “brexit” and began a transition period that concluded on december 31 2020 since the end of the transition many companies operating in the uk and eu have experienced greater restrictions on imports and exports additional regulatory complexity in their crossborder operations and currency fluctuations the longterm effects of brexit remain uncertain and may include these immediate impacts among others while we have not experienced any material financial impact from brexit on our business to date we cannot predict its future implications and any future impacts on our business and operations 

legal and regulatory risks 

there is uncertainty surrounding legal regulatory and policy changes by a new presidential administration in the united states that may directly affect us and the global economy 

we face regulatory and tax uncertainties on account of the 2020 us presidential election the new presidential administration is continuing to articulate its fiscal and legislative priorities for the next several years however the administration has indicated a desire to reform various aspects of existing trade and tax laws and to increase the federal minimum wage to at least 15 per hour the nature timing and economic and political effects of any potential change to the current legal and regulatory framework affecting us remains highly uncertain changes and uncertainty surrounding our operating environment including us labor laws trade policies and practices tariffs or taxes in particular could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and growth prospects 

because we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees and other costs as well as reputational harm 

we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers employees or other third parties for various reasons for example we are party to among other litigation numerous pending product liability lawsuits relating to our national distribution of automotive parts and supplies many of which involve claims of personal injury allegedly resulting from the use of automotive parts distributed by us the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

additionally we are subject to numerous laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate as well as governmental regulations relating to taxes environmental protection product quality standards data privacy building and zoning requirements and employment law matters if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs in addition our capital expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations 

we may be affected by global climate change or legal tax regulatory or market responses to such change 

the concern over climate change has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions “ghg” for example proposals that would impose mandatory requirements related to ghg continue to be considered by policy makers in the us and elsewhere laws enacted to reduce ghg could directly or indirectly affect our suppliers and could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows changes in automotive technology including the adoption of electric vehicles and compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretations of existing laws could require additional expenditures by us or our suppliers all of which could adversely impact the demand for our products and our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

general risks 

we are subject to risks related to corporate social responsibility and reputation 

many factors influence our reputation and the value of our brands including the perception held by our customers business partners investors other key stakeholders and the communities in which we do business our business faces increasing scrutiny related to environmental social and governance activities and disclosures and risk of damage to our reputation and the value of our brands if we fail to act responsibly in a number of areas such as environmental stewardship supply chain management climate change diversity and inclusion workplace conduct human rights philanthropy and support for local communities any harm to our reputation could impact employee engagement and retention and the willingness of 

customers and our partners to do business with us which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could affect our financial results or financial condition 

gaap and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business such as revenue recognition asset impairment impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets inventories lease obligations selfinsurance vendor allowances tax matters and litigation are complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments changes in accounting standards or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition the implementation of new accounting standards could also require certain systems internal process and other changes that could increase our operating costs 

our stock price is subject to fluctuations and the value of your investment may decline 

the trading price of our common stock is subject to fluctuations and may be subject to fluctuations in the future based upon external economic and market conditions the stock market in general has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that sometimes have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of listed companies these broad market geopolitical and industry factors among others may harm the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance and growth outlook and the value of your investment may decline

covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 outbreak which was declared a pandemic by the world health organization “who” on march 11 2020 continues to evolve rapidly our deepest and sincere thoughts go out to all affected by covid19 as well as the dedicated healthcare workers and first responders who are on the front lines for all our citizens 

overall our business segments continue to face many uncertainties the companys operations are vulnerable to the reduced economic activity caused by the covid19 outbreak many governments put in place temporary social distancing and shelterinplace mandates in late march and early april of 2020 and as a result our business segments experienced slowing sales trends as we entered the second quarter beginning in the second half of 2020 sales generally improved as markets reopened and governments eased restrictions 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic impacts the company will depend on numerous factors and future developments that we cannot predict including the severity of the virus the occurrence of additional waves or spikes in infection rates the duration of the outbreak governmental business or other actions taken in response to the pandemic and the efficacy of these actions including partial or complete shutdowns travel restrictions and stayathome orders among other actions the effectiveness and distribution of covid19 vaccines and impacts on our supply chain our ability to keep operating locations open and on customer demand while the negative impact on our business operations cannot be reasonably estimated at this time our teams are preparing for multiple scenarios to ensure we continue to protect our employees while also keeping our operations up and running to serve our customers 

during the first quarter of 2020 we created a dedicated covid19 taskforce and added enhanced protocols in response to covid19 including implementing many of the recommendations and requirements issued by the centers for disease control and prevention who and local state and national health authorities to protect our employees customers suppliers and communities 

as of december 31 2020 substantially all operations are open for business our supply chain partners have been very supportive despite strain on the supply chain with respect to labor shortages and certain inventory shortages delays in order fulfillment and increased backlogs and they continue to do their part to help our service levels to our customers remain strong we remain in constant communication with our employees regarding changing conditions and protocol based on the length and severity of covid19 we may experience continued volatility in customer demand and supply chain disruption we will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of these potential impacts to our business consolidated results of operations segment results liquidity and capital resources 

key business metrics 

we consider comparable sales to be a key business metric because management has evaluated its results of operations using this metric and we believe that this key indicator provides additional perspective and insights when analyzing the operating performance of the company from period to period and trends in its historical operating results this metric should not be considered superior to as a substitute for or as an alternative to and should be considered in conjunction with the gaap financial measures presented in this report 

comparable sales 

comparable sales refers to periodoverperiod comparisons of our net sales excluding the impact of acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency the company considers this metric useful to investors because it provides greater transparency into management’s view and assessment of the company’s core ongoing operations this metric is widely used by analysts investors and competitors in our industry although our calculation of the metric may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies because not all companies and analysts calculate this metric in the same manner

consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31 2020 totaled 165 billion down 56 from 2019 the decline in net sales is due to a 56 comparable sales decrease attributable primarily to decreased demand caused by covid19 and a 33 negative impact from divestitures these items were partially offset by a 30 positive impact from acquisitions additionally the favorable impact of foreign currency and other partially offset the decline in total sales by 03 consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31 2019 totaled 175 billion up 41 from 2018 net sales for 2019 included an approximate 51 contribution from acquisitions net of store closures and an approximate 21 increase in core sales the companys sale of certain noncore businesses determined to be slowergrowth and lowermargin operations partially offset total sales by 16 additionally the unfavorable impact of foreign currency partially offset 2019 total sales by 15 

the companys comparable sales included both an increase in sales volume and product inflation the impact of product inflation varied by business segment in 2020 with prices flat in the automotive segment and up 07 in our industrial segment due to the companys global initiatives to grow revenues we believe it is well positioned for sustainable longterm growth

net sales for the industrial parts group were 65 billion in 2019 up 36 from 2018 the increase in sales reflects an approximate 52 contribution from acquisitions and a 17 increase in comparable sales offset by an approximate 31 decrease in net sales related to the sale of eis total industrial sales were positively impacted by product inflation of 24 as a portion of this increase was passed through to customers and is included in the comparable sales increase industrial revenues were up approximately 57 in the first quarter of 2019 up 49 in the second quarter up 99 in the third quarter and down 59 in the fourth quarter these quarterly results reflect the impact of several factors including the slowing trend in the industrial economy throughout the course of the year as evidenced by weakening economic indicators such as manufacturing industrial production and the purchasing managers index among others in addition the july 1 2019 acquisition of inenco now referred to as motion asia pacific one of australasias leading industrial distributors and the sale of eis on september 30 2019 impacted the quarterly sales comparisons for the industrial group in 2019

depreciation and amortization expense was 2728 million in 2020 an increase of approximately 156 million or 61 from 2019 due primarily to an increase in fixed assets acquired at the end of 2019 that began fully depreciating in 2020 the provision for doubtful accounts was 236 million in 2020 a 97 million increase from 2019 due primarily to higher collectability risks associated with the covid19 pandemic we believe the company is adequately reserved for bad debts and credit losses at december 31 2020

goodwill impairment 

due to several factors that coalesced in the second quarter of 2020 we performed an interim impairment test as of may 31 2020 for our european reporting unit and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 5067 million these factors primarily resulted from the ongoing market volatility and uncertainty caused by the covid19 pandemic which extended into the second quarter and impacted several critical impairment testing assumptions including weighted average cost of capital and market multiples and nearterm revenue and operating margin projections for the reporting unit refer to the goodwill and 

other intangible assets footnote within the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information if there are sustained declines in macroeconomic or business conditions in future periods including as a result of the continued covid19 pandemic affecting the projected earnings and cash flows at our reporting units among other things there can be no assurance that goodwill at one or more reporting units may not be impaired as of december 31 2020 we determined that there were no indicators that goodwill was impaired at any of our reporting units

in 2019 the company recorded 428 million in special termination costs related to benefits provided through the companys defined benefit plans to employees that accepted the voluntary retirement program vrp package as part of the companys 2019 cost savings plan refer to the restructuring footnote in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

in “other” the net benefit of interest income equity method investment income investment dividends noncontrolling interests and pension income in 2020 was 581 million an approximate 286 million decrease from the prior year primarily driven by an immaterial loss on investment and changes in retirement plan valuation in 2019 the 253 million increase in income from 2018 was primarily driven by changes in retirement plan valuation

automotive group 

automotives segment profit increased 43 in 2020 from 2019 and segment profit margin was 80 in 2020 as compared to 76 in 2019 the increase in segment profit margin reflects the strong operating results in north america and australasia driven by the positive impact of cost actions which offset the 44 decrease in comparable sales for automotive the companys european automotive operations were the most challenged in 2020 although this business made significant progress during the year with improved margins in both the third and fourth quarters to further improve automotives segment margin this group will continue to execute on its growth plans and cost initiatives in 2021 and the years ahead 

automotives segment profit decreased 28 in 2019 from 2018 and segment margin was 76 in 2019 as compared to 81 in 2018 the decrease in segment margin reflects the loss of expense leverage due to the 23 growth in comparable sales for automotive in addition rising costs in several areas as described above negatively impacted automotives segment margin 

industrial group 

industrial’s segment profit decreased 77 in 2020 from 2019 and segment profit margin was 85 an increase from 80 in 2019 the improvement in segment profit margin for this group primarily reflects the benefits of an improved gross margin despite the reduced demand from the covid19 pandemic and lower costs the company believes that strengthening economic indicators such as manufacturing industrial production and the purchasing managers index combined with effective growth initiatives and cost actions position the industrial group for further growth in 2021 

industrial’s segment profit increased 71 in 2019 from 2018 and segment margin was 80 an increase from 77 in 2018 the improvement in segment margin for this group primarily reflects the benefit of improved gross margins despite the slowing sales trend during the year and 17 comparable sales growth 2019 was a transformative year for industrial given the addition of motion asia pacific in australasia and sale of eis 

income taxes 

the effective income tax rate of 569 in 2020 increased from 248 in 2019 the increase in rate is primarily due to a nondeductible goodwill impairment charge and other onetime costs incurred during the year 

the effective income tax rate of 248 in 2019 increased from 246 in 2018 the increase in rate is primarily due to geographic income tax rate mix shifts and the impact of onetime transaction and other costs as well as changes in the realizability of future tax benefit adjustments recorded in the comparable periods

certain information regarding nongaap financial measures 

the following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income from continuing operations and diluted net income from continuing operations per common share to adjusted net income from continuing operations and adjusted diluted net income from continuing operations per common share to account for the impact of adjustments the company believes that the presentation of adjusted net income from continuing operations and adjusted diluted net income from continuing operations per common share which are not calculated in accordance with gaap when considered together with the corresponding gaap financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the companys core operations the company considers these metrics useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management’s view and assessment of the company’s ongoing operating performance by removing items management believes are not representative of our continuing operations and may distort our longerterm operating trends we believe these measures to be useful to enhance the comparability of our results from period to period and with our competitors as well as to show ongoing results from operations distinct from items that are infrequent or not associated with the company’s core operations the company does not nor does it suggest investors should consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for gaap financial information

in 2019 net cash provided by operating activities totaled 08 billion a 02 billion or 212 decrease from 2018 the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the change in working capital in 2019 as compared to 2018 as the companys increase in accounts payable was less than in the prior year

purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in our estimates we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual cash requirement as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements our purchase orders are based on our current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons the company does not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements 

additionally the company guarantees the borrowings of certain independently owned automotive parts stores independents and certain other affiliates in which the company has a noncontrolling equity ownership interest affiliates the company’s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these independents and affiliates is generally equal to the total borrowings subject to the company’s guarantee at december 31 2020 the total borrowings of the independents and affiliates subject to guarantee by the company were approximately 8847 million these loans generally mature over periods from one to six years our amount of commitment expiring in 2021 is approximately 4207 million to date the company has had no significant losses in connection with guarantees of independents’ and affiliates’ borrowings 

share repurchases 

in 2020 the company repurchased approximately 11 million shares of its common stock and the company had remaining authority to purchase approximately 145 million shares of its common stock at december 31 2020 there were no other repurchase plans announced as of december 31 2020 

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we describe in this section certain critical accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates assumptions and judgments an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially impact the consolidated financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for further information on the critical accounting policies see the summary of significant accounting policies footnote in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

inventories — provisions for slow moving and obsolescence 

the company identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates appropriate provisions related thereto historically these losses have not been significant as the vast majority of the company’s inventories are not highly susceptible to obsolescence and a majority are eligible for return under various vendor return programs while the company has no reason to believe its inventory return privileges will be discontinued in the future its risk of loss associated with obsolete or slow moving inventories would increase if such were to occur 

allowance for doubtful accounts — methodology 

the company evaluates the collectability of trade accounts receivable based on a combination of factors the company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on various factors including historical experience current economic conditions and expected future credit losses and collectability trends the company periodically adjusts this estimate when the company becomes aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations eg bankruptcy filing or as a result of changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable while the company has a large customer base that is geographically dispersed a general economic downturn in any of the industry segments in which the company operates could result in higher than expected defaults and therefore the need to revise estimates for bad debts for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 the company recorded provisions for doubtful accounts of approximately 236 million 139 million and 159 million respectively 

consideration received from vendors 

the company may enter into agreements at the beginning of each year with many of its vendors that provide for inventory purchase incentives generally the company earns inventory purchase incentives upon achieving specified volume purchasing levels or other criteria the company accrues for the receipt of these incentives as part of its inventory cost based on cumulative purchases of inventory to date and projected inventory purchases through the end of the year while management believes the company will continue to receive consideration from vendors in 2021 and beyond there can be no assurance that vendors will continue to provide comparable amounts of incentives in the future or that we will be able to achieve the specified volumes necessary to take advantage of such incentives 

impairment of property plant and equipment and goodwill and other intangible assets 

at least annually the company evaluates property plant and equipment goodwill and other intangible assets for potential impairment indicators the company’s judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance among other factors future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired evaluating for impairment also requires the company to estimate future operating results and cash flows which requires judgment by management any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and results of operations refer to the goodwill and other intangible assets footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on the results of the companys annual goodwill impairment testing 

employee benefit plans 

the company’s benefit plan committees in the us and canada establish investment policies and strategies and regularly monitor the performance of the company’s pension plan assets the plans in europe are unfunded and therefore there are no plan assets the pension plan investment strategy implemented by the company’s management is to achieve longterm objectives and invest the pension assets in accordance with the applicable pension legislation in the us and canada as well as fiduciary standards the longterm primary objectives for the pension plan funds are to provide for a reasonable amount of longterm growth of capital without undue exposure to risk protect the assets from erosion of purchasing power and provide investment results that meet or exceed the pension plans’ actuarially assumed longterm rates of return the company’s investment strategy with respect to pension plan assets is to generate a return in excess of the passive portfolio benchmark 47 sp 500 index 5 russell mid cap index 7 russell 2000 index 5 msci eafe index 5 dj global moderate index 3 msci emerging market net and 28 barclays us long govtcredit 

we make several critical assumptions in determining our pension plan assets and liabilities and related pension income we believe the most critical of these assumptions are the expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate other assumptions we make relate to employee demographic factors such as rate of compensation increases mortality rates retirement patterns and turnover rates refer to the employee benefit plans footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding these assumptions 

based on the investment policy for the pension plans as well as an asset study that was performed based on the company’s asset allocations and future expectations the company’s expected rate of return on plan assets for measuring 2021 pension income is 688 for the plans the asset study forecasted expected rates of return for the approximate duration of the company’s benefit obligations using capital market data and historical relationships 

the discount rate is chosen as the rate at which pension obligations could be effectively settled and is based on capital market conditions as of the measurement date we have matched the timing and duration of the expected cash flows of our pension obligations to a yield curve generated from a broad portfolio of highquality fixed income debt instruments to select our discount rate based upon this cash flow matching analysis we selected a weighted average discount rate for the plans of 27 at december 31 2020 

effective december 31 2013 our defined benefit pension plans was amended to freeze benefit plan accruals for participants and provide for immediate vesting of accrued benefits net periodic benefit income for our defined benefit pension plans was 180 million 162 million and 158 million for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively the income associated with the pension plans in 2020 2019 and 2018 reflects the impact of the freeze refer to the employee benefit plans footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding employee benefit plans 

business combinations 

when the company acquires businesses it applies the acquisition method of accounting and recognizes the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree at their fair values on the acquisition date which requires significant estimates and assumptions goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed the acquisition method requires the company to record provisional amounts for any items for which the accounting is not complete at the end of a reporting period the company must complete the accounting during the measurement period which cannot exceed one year adjustments made during the measurement period could have a material impact on the companys financial condition and results of operations 

the company typically measures customer relationship and other intangible assets using an income approach significant estimates and assumptions used in this approach include discount rates and certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted cash flows expected to be generated from the asset eg future revenue growth rates operating margins and attrition rates if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values the company could record impairment charges in addition the company has estimated the economic lives of certain acquired tangible and intangible assets and these lives are used to 

calculate depreciation and amortization expense if the companys estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could be increased or decreased or the acquired asset could be impaired 

legal and product liabilities 

the company accrues for potential losses related to legal disputes litigation product liabilities and regulatory matters when it is probable the future event or events are likely to occur that the company will incur a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 

to calculate product liabilities the company estimates potential losses relating to pending claims and also estimates the likelihood of additional similar claims being filed against the company in the future to estimate potential losses on claims that could be filed in the future the company considers claims pending against the company claim filing rates the number of codefendants and the extent to which they share in settlements and the amount of loss by claim type the estimated losses for pending and potential future claims are calculated on a discounted basis using riskfree interest rates derived from market data about monetary assets with maturities comparable to those of the projected product liabilities the company uses an actuarial specialist to assist with measuring its product liabilities refer to the commitments and contingencies footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding product liabilities 

self insurance 

the company is selfinsured for the majority of its group health insurance costs a reserve for claims incurred but not reported is developed by analyzing historical claims data provided by the company’s claims administrators these reserves are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as the expenses are expected to be paid within one year 

longterm insurance liabilities consist primarily of reserves for the companys workers’ compensation program in addition the company carries various large risk deductible workers’ compensation policies for the majority of workers’ compensation liabilities the company records the workers’ compensation reserves based on an analysis performed by an independent actuary the analysis calculates development factors which are applied to total reserves as provided by the various insurance companies who underwrite the program while the company believes that the assumptions used to calculate these liabilities are appropriate significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect workers’ compensation costs 

income taxes 

the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amount and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded net as noncurrent deferred income taxes in addition valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized in making this determination the company considers all available positive and negative evidence including projected future taxable income future reversals of existing temporary differences recent financial operations and tax planning strategies 

the company recognizes a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits

 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  

although the company does not face material risks related to commodity prices the company is exposed to changes in interest rates and in foreign currency rates with respect to foreign currency denominated operating revenues and expenses 

foreign currency 

the company incurs translation gains or losses resulting from the translation of an operating unit’s foreign functional currency into us dollars for consolidated financial statement purposes for the periods presented the company’s principal foreign currency exchange exposures are the euro the functional currency of our european operations the canadian dollar the functional currency of our canadian operations and the australian dollar the functional currency of our australasian operations we monitor our foreign currency exposures and from time to time we enter into currency forward contracts to manage our exposure to currency fluctuations foreign currency exchange exposure particularly in regard to the euro positively impacted our results for the year ended december 31 2020 this positive impact was mostly offset by the negative impact from the canadian and australian dollar for the full year ended december 31 2020 foreign currency exchange 

exposure particularly in regard to the canadian and australian dollar and to a lesser extent the euro negatively impacted our results for the year ended december 31 2019 

during 2020 and 2019 it was estimated that a 10 shift in exchange rates between those foreign functional currencies and the us dollar would have impacted translated net sales by approximately 549 million and 508 million respectively a 15 shift in exchange rates between those functional currencies and the us dollar would have impacted translated net sales by approximately 824 million in 2020 and 763 million in 2019 a 20 shift in exchange rates between those functional currencies and the us dollar would have impacted translated net sales by approximately 1099 million in 2020 and 1017 million in 2019 

interest rates 

the company is subject to interest rate volatility with regard to existing and future issuances of debt we monitor our mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt as well as our mix of shortterm debt and longterm debt from time to time we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations based on the companys variablerate debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of december 31 2020 and 2019 we estimate that a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by 11 million in 2020 and 55 million in 2019 however these increases in interest expense would have been partially offset by the increases in interest income related to higher interest rates

forwardlooking statements are only as of the date they are made and the company undertakes no duty to update its forwardlooking statements except as required by law you are advised however to review any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our subsequent forms 10q 8k and other reports filed with the sec 

set forth below are the material risks and uncertainties that if they were to occur could materially and adversely affect our business or could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements in this report and in the other public statements we make please be aware that these risks may change over time and other risks may prove to be important in the future new risks may emerge at any time and we cannot predict such risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our business financial condition results of operations or the trading price of our securities 

we may not be able to successfully implement our business initiatives in each of our three business segments to grow our sales and earnings which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have implemented numerous initiatives in each of our three business segments to grow sales and earnings including the introduction of new and expanded product lines strategic acquisitions geographic expansion including through acquisitions sales to new markets enhanced customer marketing programs and a variety of gross margin and cost savings initiatives if we are unable to implement these initiatives efficiently and effectively or if these initiatives are unsuccessful our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

successful implementation of these initiatives also depends on factors specific to the automotive parts industry and the other industries in which we operate and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control in addition to the other risk factors contained in this “item 1a risk factors” adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our business initiatives and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 



 our business will be adversely affected if demand for our products slows 

our business depends on customer demand for the products that we distribute demand for these products depends on many factors 

with respect to our automotive group the primary factors are 

 with respect to our industrial parts group the primary factors are 

 with respect to our business products group the primary factors are 



changes in legislation or government regulations or policies could have a significant impact on our results of operations 

certain political developments including among others i the results of elections in the us and globally and the impact of such results on political decisionmaking and ii unrest in the uk and europe have resulted in increased economic uncertainty for multinational companies operating within the uk and europe these developments may result in economic and trade policy actions that could impact economic conditions in many countries and continue to change the landscape of international trade our business is global so changes to existing international trade agreements blocking of foreign trade or imposition of tariffs on foreign goods could result in decreased revenues andor increases in pricing either of which could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows in future periods for instance the united states imposed section 232 tariffs on many imported products of steel and aluminum in march 2018 and expanded the tariffs to additional derivative products of steel and aluminum effective february 8 2020 the united states imposed section 301 tariffs on most imported products from china starting in july 2018 although the united states and china reached a phase one trade deal in january 2020 most of these tariffs remain in place and uncertainty persists in the trade relationship between the two countries that impacts the global trade landscape in addition the tax cuts and jobs act the act was signed into law on december 22 2017 the act which reduced the us corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 requires companies to pay a onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings 

the uks exit from the european union “eu” will continue to have uncertain effects and could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

on january 31 2020 the uk exited from the eu commonly referred to as “brexit” while a transition period of 11month begins during which the uk will continue to follow the eu rules including remaining a member of the eu single market and customs union the final ukeu relationship is still uncertain for companies doing business both in the uk and the overall global economy brexit has impacted global markets including various currencies and resulted in a sharp decline in the value of the british pound as compared to the us dollar and other major currencies the fluctuation of currency exchange rates may expose us to gains and losses on nonus currency transactions volatility in the securities markets and in currency exchange rates may continue as the uk negotiates its new rules and trade deals with the eu during the transition period and after while we have not experienced any material financial impact from brexit on our business to date we cannot predict its future implications any impact from brexit on our business and operations over the long term will depend in part on the outcome of final tariff tax treaties trade regulatory and other negotiations the uk conducts 

uncertainty andor deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions domestically and globally including unemployment inflation or deflation changes in tax policies changes in energy costs uncertain credit markets or other economic conditions could have a negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our business and operating results have been and may in the future be adversely affected by uncertain global economic conditions including domestic outputs political uncertainty and unrest employment rates inflation or deflation changes in tax policies instability in credit markets declining consumer and business confidence fluctuating commodity prices interest rates volatile exchange rates and other challenges that could affect the global economy both our commercial and retail customers may experience deterioration of their financial resources which could result in existing or potential customers delaying or canceling plans to purchase our products our vendors could experience similar negative conditions which could impact their ability to fulfill their financial obligations to us future weakness in the global economy could adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we face substantial competition in the industries in which we do business 

the sale of automotive parts industrial parts and business products is highly competitive and impacted by many factors including name recognition product availability customer service changing customer preferences store location and pricing pressures because we seek to offer competitive prices if our competitors reduce their prices we may be forced to reduce our prices which could result in a material decline in our revenues and earnings increased competition among distributors of automotive industrial parts and office products including increased availability among digital and ecommerce providers across the markets in which we do business could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations the company anticipates no decline in competition in any of its three business segments in the foreseeable future 

in particular the market for replacement automotive parts is highly competitive and subjects us to a wide variety of competitors we compete primarily with national international and regional auto parts chains independently owned regional and local automotive parts and accessories stores automobile dealers that supply manufacturer replacement parts and accessories mass merchandisers internet providers and wholesale clubs that sell automotive products and regional and local full service automotive repair shops both new and established 

furthermore both the automotive aftermarket and the office supply industries continue to experience consolidation consolidation among our competitors could further enhance their financial position provide them with the ability to offer more 

competitive prices to customers for whom we compete and allow them to achieve increased efficiencies in their consolidated operations that enable them to more effectively compete for customers if we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies or if our competitors develop more effective strategies we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

in addition the loss or significant reduction in purchase volume of a major customer in the business products group could significantly impact its results of operations 

we depend on our relationships with our suppliers and a disruption of our suppliers relationships or a disruption in our suppliers’ operations could harm our business 

as a distributor of automotive parts industrial parts and business products our business depends on developing and maintaining close and productive relationships with our suppliers we depend on our suppliers to sell us quality products at favorable prices many factors outside our control including without limitation raw material shortages inadequate manufacturing capacity labor disputes tariff legislation transportation disruptions tax and other legislative uncertainties pandemics andor weather conditions could adversely affect our suppliers’ ability to deliver to us quality merchandise at favorable prices in a timely manner 

furthermore financial or operational difficulties with a particular suppliers could cause that suppliers to increase the cost of the products or decrease the quality of the products we purchase supplier consolidation could also limit the number of suppliers from which we may purchase products and could materially affect the prices we pay for these products in addition we would suffer an adverse impact if our suppliers limit or cancel the return privileges that currently protect us from inventory obsolescence 

in december 2019 a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in wuhan china the impact to our supply chain cannot be reasonably estimated at this time at the time of this filing the outbreak has been largely concentrated in china although cases have been confirmed in other countries the company does not currently sell any products in china but it does source a portion of its products from china the extent to which the coronavirus impacts our results will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact among others 

we recognize the growing demand for businesstobusiness and businesstocustomer digital and ecommerce options and solutions and we could lose business if we fail to provide the digital and ecommerce options and solutions our customers wish to use 

our success in digital and ecommerce depends on our ability to accurately identify the products to make available through digital and ecommerce platforms across our business segments and to establish and maintain such platforms to provide an efficient online experience with the highest level of data security to our customers on and through the platforms our customers wish to use including mobile with rapidly changing technology in a highly competitive environment 

if we experience a security breach if our internal information systems fail to function properly or if we are unsuccessful in implementing integrating or upgrading our information systems our business operations could be materially affected 

we depend on information systems to process customer orders manage inventory and accounts receivable collections purchase products manage accounts payable processes ship products to customers on a timely basis maintain cost effective operations provide superior service to customers and accumulate financial results among many other things 

despite our implementation of various security measures our it systems and operations could be subject to damages or interruptions from computer viruses natural disasters unauthorized physical or electronic access power outages telecommunications failure computer system or network failures wire transfer failure employee errormalfeasance cyberattacks security breaches and other similar disruptions additionally the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyberattacks and breaches of it systems change frequently and have the potential to not be recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time maintaining operating and protecting these systems and related personal information about our employees customers and suppliers requires continuous investments in physical and technological security measures employee training and thirdparty services which the company has made and will continue to make a security breach could result in among other things sensitive and confidential data being lost manipulated or exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public or delay our ability to process customer orders and manage inventory while we also seek to obtain assurances from third parties with whom we interact to protect confidential information there are risks that the confidentiality or accessibility of data held or utilized by such third parties may be compromised 

a serious prolonged disruption of our information systems for any of the above reasons could materially impair fundamental business processes and increase expenses decrease sales or otherwise impact earnings and cash flows furthermore such a breach may harm our reputation and business prospects and subject us to legal claims if there is loss disclosure or misappropriation of or access to our customers employees or suppliers information as the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and use and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous compliance with these requirements could also result in 

significant additional costs as threats related to cybersecurity breaches grow more sophisticated and frequent it may become more difficult to timely detect and protect our data and infrastructure 

our strategic transactions involve risks which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions 

we regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions including mergers acquisitions investments alliances and other growth and market expansion strategies with the expectation that these transactions will result in increases in sales cost savings synergies and various other benefits assessing the viability and realizing the benefits of these transactions is subject to significant uncertainty for each of our acquisitions we need to successfully integrate the target company’s products services associates and systems into our business operations integration can be a complex and timeconsuming process and if the integration is not fully successful or is delayed for a material period of time we may not achieve the anticipated synergies or benefits of the acquisition furthermore even if the target companies are successfully integrated the acquisitions may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated expose us to increased competition or challenges with respect to our products or services and expose us to additional liabilities any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets acquired in a strategic transaction may reduce our earnings additionally we consider and enter into divestitures from time to time with the expectation that these transactions will result in increases in cost savings and various other benefits strategic divestitures are subject to uncertainty and can be a complex and timeconsuming process if the divestiture is not fully successful or is delayed for a material period of time we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the divestiture 

because we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees and other costs as well as reputational harm 

we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers employees or other third parties for various reasons the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

additionally we are subject to numerous laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate as well as governmental regulations relating to taxes environmental protection product quality standards data privacy building and zoning requirements and employment law matters if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs in addition our capital expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations 

we are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key persons could harm our business 

our future success significantly depends on the continued services and performance of our key management personnel we believe our management team’s depth and breadth of experience in our industry is integral to executing our business plan we also will need to continue to attract motivate and retain other key personnel the loss of services of members of our senior management team or other key employees the inability to attract additional qualified personnel as needed or failure to plan for the succession of senior management and key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our debt levels could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations 

we have an unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured senior notes which could have important consequences to our financial health for example our level of indebtedness could among other things 

 in addition the terms of our financing obligations include restrictions such as affirmative negative and financial covenants conditions on borrowing and subsidiary guarantees a failure to comply with these restrictions could result in a default under our financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions the 

occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could affect our financial results or financial condition 

gaap and related accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business such as revenue recognition asset impairment impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets inventories lease obligations selfinsurance vendor allowances tax matters and litigation are complex and involve many subjective assumptions estimates and judgments changes in accounting standards or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition the implementation of new accounting standards could also require certain systems internal process and other changes that could increase our operating costs 

our stock price is subject to fluctuations and the value of your investment may decline 

the trading price of our common stock is subject to fluctuations and may be subject to fluctuations in the future based upon external economic and market conditions the stock market in general has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that sometimes have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of listed companies these broad market geopolitical and industry factors among others may harm the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance and growth outlook and the value of your investment may decline 

we may be affected by global climate change or legal regulatory or market responses to such change 

the concern over climate change has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions “ghg” for example proposals that would impose mandatory requirements related to ghg continue to be considered by policy makers in the us and elsewhere laws enacted to reduce ghg could directly or indirectly affect our suppliers and could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows changes in automotive technology and compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretations of existing laws could require additional expenditures by us or our suppliers all of which could adversely impact the demand for our products and our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we are subject to risks related to corporate social responsibility and reputation 

many factors influence our reputation and the value of our brands including the perception held by our customers business partners investors other key stakeholders and the communities in which we do business our business faces increasing scrutiny related to environmental social and governance activities and disclosures and risk of damage to our reputation and the value of our brands if we fail to act responsibly in a number of areas such as environmental stewardship supply chain management climate change diversity and inclusion workplace conduct human rights philanthropy and support for local communities any harm to our reputation could impact employee engagement and retention and the willingness of customers and our partners to do business with us which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows 

if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis which could result in a loss of investor confidence and negatively impact our business results of operations financial condition and stock price 

effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial statements and to effectively prevent fraud however a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met there can be no assurance that all control issues or fraud will be detected as we continue to grow our business our internal controls continue to become more complex and require more resources any failure to maintain effective controls could prevent us from timely and reliably reporting financial results and may harm our operating results in addition if we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified report as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of each fiscal year end we may be exposed to negative publicity which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information any failure to maintain effective internal controls and any such resulting negative publicity may negatively affect our business and stock price 

additionally the existence of any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies would require management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and management may not be able to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in a timely manner the existence of any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could also result in errors in our financial statements that could require us to restate our financial statements cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause 

stockholders to lose confidence in our reported financial information all of which could materially and adversely affect us and the market price of our common stock 

we may be adversely affected by changes in the method of determining the london interbank offered rate “libor” or the replacement of libor with an alternative reference rate for our variable rate loans derivative contracts and other financial assets and liabilities 

our business relies upon a large volume of loans derivative contracts and other financial instruments which are directly or indirectly dependent on libor to establish their interest rate andor value the uk financial conduct authority announced in 2017 that it would no longer compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 it is not possible to predict whether banks will continue to provide libor submissions to the administrator of libor whether libor rates will cease to be published or supported before or after 2021 or whether any additional reforms to libor may be enacted in the united kingdom or elsewhere it is expected that a transition away from the widespread use of libor to alternative rates is likely to occur during the next several years 

while we have established a working group consisting of key stakeholders from throughout the company to monitor developments relating to libor uncertainty and changes and to guide the company’s response the impact of these developments on our business and financial results is not yet known the transition from libor may cause us to incur increased costs and additional risk uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes in or other reforms to libor may adversely affect libor rates and the value of liborbased loans originated prior to 2021 if libor rates are no longer available any successor or replacement interest rates may perform differently which may affect our net interest income change our market risk profile and require changes to our risk pricing and hedging strategies any failure to adequately manage this transition could adversely impact our business results of operations and cash flows

the companys automotive parts group operated in the us canada france the uk germany poland the netherlands belgium australia and new zealand in 2019  and accounted for 57 of total revenues for the year our industrial parts group entered 2019 with operations in the us canada mexico and expanded its operations into australia new zealand indonesia and singapore in july 2019 with the addition of the inenco business the industrial parts group accounted for 34 of the companys total revenues in 2019  our business products group operated in the us and canada in 2019  although its canadian operations were divested effective january 1 2020 the business products group accounted for 9 of total revenues in 2019  

at genuine parts company our mission is to be a worldclass service organization and the employer of choice supplier of choice valued customer good corporate citizen and investment of choice our strategic financial objectives are intended to align with our mission and drive value for all our stakeholders our strategic financial objectives include 1 top line revenue growth 2 improved operating margin 3 strong balance sheet and cash flow and 4 effective capital allocation 

top line revenue 

the companys strategy for top line revenue growth includes a combination of organic and acquisitive initiatives designed to outpace the industry improve the market share in each of our business segments and position the company for sustained longterm growth in 2019 this strategy led to 17 comparable sales growth and a 46 contribution from acquisitions comparable store sales also called organic sales or core sales refer to period‑over‑period comparisons of our net sales excluding the impact of acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency 

our strategic initiatives also led us to divest of certain noncore businesses determined to be slowergrowth and lowermargin operations these divestitures and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency partially offset our total sales growth for the year 

operating margins 

the company targets continuous operating margin improvement each year in 2019 the competitive dynamics across our businesses as well as the continued cost pressures and the need to invest in a more productive and efficient cost structure led us to expand and accelerate our initiatives to improve the operating performance of the company these efforts produced improved gross margins in 2019 and we believe created a path for significant cost savings in the years ahead 

in october of 2019 the company approved and began to implement certain restructuring actions across its subsidiaries primarily targeted at simplifying organizational structures and distribution networks the 2019 cost savings plan the company expects the 2019 cost savings plan to result in 100 million in annualized operating expense reductions by allowing it to more effectively and efficiently manage its businesses among other things the 2019 cost savings plan will result in workforce reductions and facility closures and consolidations the company executed a voluntary retirement program vrp for its us and canadian subsidiaries in the fourth quarter of 2019 in connection with this plan the company is well underway in executing the 2019 cost savings plan 

balance sheet and cash flow 

the company is focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet and generating strong cash flows to support our growth initiatives in 2019 we deployed less total working capital and improved our working capital efficiency or working capital as a percent of total revenues to 80  

the company generated 8920 million in cash from operations and also benefited from cash proceeds associated with the sale of certain noncore businesses in 2019 as noted before we utilized our cash for effective capital allocation 

capital allocation 

the companys priorities for effective capital allocation have remained consistent for many years in 2019 we used cash for key investments in the form of capital expenditures and accretive acquisitions as well as the return of capital to our shareholders via cash dividends and opportunistic share repurchases 

results of operations 

our results of operations are summarized below for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  



net sales 

consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31 2019 totaled 194 billion  up 35 from 2018  2019 net sales included an approximate 46 contribution from acquisitions net of store closures and an approximate 17 increase in core sales the companys sale of certain noncore businesses determined to be slowergrowth and lowermargin operations partially offset total sales by 14  additionally the unfavorable impact of foreign currency partially offset total sales by 14  

the companys core sales growth which represents the companys comparable sales included both the increase in sales volume and product inflation the impact of product inflation varied by business segment in 2019  with prices up approximately 24 in the us automotive and industrial segments and up approximately 30 in the business products segment due to the companys global initiatives to grow revenues we believe it is well positioned for sustainable longterm growth 

automotive group 

net sales for the automotive group “automotive” were 110 billion in 2019  a 44 increase from 2018  the increase in sales consists of an approximate 50 contribution from acquisitions a 23 comparable sales increase and a 23 negative impact of currency translation associated with our automotive businesses in canada australasia europe and mexico in addition the sale of auto todo in 2019 the companys legacy automotive business in mexico slightly offset total sales for the automotive group 

automotive sales were positively impacted by product inflation of 24 in the us operations in 2019  total automotive revenues were up approximately 23 in the first quarter up 14 in the second quarter up 53 in the third quarter and up 87 in the fourth quarter with the higher third and fourth quarter increases due to the positive impact of various acquisitions in particular we expanded our european footprint in june with the acquisition of partspoint group in the netherlands and belgium sound industry fundamentals and effective growth strategies drove organic growth of approximately 3 or more in the us canada and australasia this was offset by core sales declines in our european operations which faced several challenges in 2019 primarily related to regional economic and geopolitical concerns our team in europe worked throughout the year to navigate these challenges resulting in improved sales trends in europe in the last half of the year in our view the underlying fundamentals in the automotive aftermarket including trends related to the overall number and age of the vehicle population as well as the continued increase in miles driven remain supportive of sustained demand for automotive aftermarket maintenance and supply items across the markets we serve we expect these fundamentals and our ongoing sales initiatives to drive sales growth for the automotive group in 2020 

industrial parts group 

net sales for the industrial parts group “industrial” were 65 billion in 2019  up 36 from 2018  the increase in sales reflects an approximate 52 contribution from acquisitions and a 17 increase in comparable sales offset by an approximate 31 decrease in net sales related to the sale of eis a noncore component of the industrial business due to its slowergrowth and lowermargin profile total industrial sales were positively impacted by product inflation of 24  as a portion of this increase was passed through to customers and is included in the comparable sales increase industrial revenues were up approximately 57 in the first quarter of 2019  up 49 in the second quarter up 99 in the third quarter and down 59 in the fourth quarter these quarterly results reflect the impact of several factors including the slowing trend in the industrial economy throughout the course of the year as evidenced by weakening economic indicators such as manufacturing industrial production and the purchasing managers index among others in addition the july acquisition of inenco one of australasias leading industrial distributors and the sale of eis on september 30 2019 impacted the quarterly sales comparisons for the industrial group in 2019 we are confident in our growth plans for 2020 both in north america and australasia but also expect to experience a relatively slow industrial economy through at least the first half of the year 

business products group 

net sales for sp richards our business products group “business products” were 19 billion in 2019  a decrease of 18 from 2018  the decrease in sales reflects the decline in core sales and was especially pronounced in the fourth quarter which was significantly slower relative to the first three quarters of the year due to industry consolidation and incr eased competition 

sales were up approximately 10 in the first quarter down 11 in the second quarter down 09 in the third quarter and down 63 in the fourth quarter of 2019  while the business products industry continues to face significant challenges our strategy to diversify our traditional product offering into the large and growing facilities breakroom and safety supplies fbs category has partially offset these challenges on january 1 2020 we divested of our canadian operations in the business products group to simplify our business model and focus on our us operations as we look ahead we remain focused on our core growth initiatives and maximizing the growth prospects for our diversified business but will also continue to evaluate all opportunities that may help us more effectively navigate the evolving industry dynamics in which this group competes 

cost of goods sold 

the company includes in cost of goods sold the actual cost of merchandise which represents the vast majority of this line item other items in cost of goods sold include warranty costs and inbound freight from the suppliers net of any vendor allowances and incentives cost of goods sold was 131 billion in 2019  a 25 increase from  128 billion in 2018  the increase in cost of goods sold in 2019 compares to a 35 total sales increase and is a positive reflection of our global supply chain initiatives the lower cost of goods sold models at certain acquired companies such as partspoint and inenco and the sale of the lower margin eis business these items were slightly offset by relatively unchanged levels of supplier incentives in 2019 compared to 2018  cost of goods sold represented 674 of net sales in 2019  decreasing from 681 of net sales in 2018  

in 2019 and 2018  each of the companys business segments experienced vendor price increases in 2019 tariffs on certain goods sourced directly or indirectly from china were a contributing factor in the price increases for the automotive and business products segments historically where we experience price increases we are able to work with our customers to pass most of these increases along to them 

operating expenses 

the company includes in selling administrative and other expenses “sga” all personnel and personnelrelated costs at its headquarters distribution centers stores and branches which accounts for more than 60 of total sga additional costs in sga include our facilities delivery marketing advertising technology digital legal and professional costs 

sga of 49 billion in 2019 increased by 03 billion or approximately 69 from 2018  this represents 254 of net sales in 2019 compared to 246 of net sales in 2018  the increase in sga expenses from the prior year reflects a combination of factors including the impact of increased sales for the year in addition our expenses reflect the impact of higher cost and higher gross margin models at certain acquired businesses including partspoint and inenco as well as the sale of eis which had a lower level of sga expenses relative to total sales we also experienced rising costs in areas such as labor freight and delivery insurance legal and professional and technology for the year although our labor and freight costs trended more favorably in the fourth quarter further we incurred incremental costs associated with our acquisitions during the year the increase in sga expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2019 relative to the prior year reflects the cost increases described above as well as the loss of leverage associated with the 17 comparable sales growth for the company 

to improve on our sga expense levels we continue to execute on our growth initiatives to better leverage our expenses additionally we are working towards a lower cost and highly effective infrastructure via steps to accelerate the integration of our acquisitions investments to enhance our productivity and innovative strategies to unlock greater savings and efficiencies across our operations through the 2019 costs savings plan discussed above the company expects to reduce expenses by an annualized runrate of 100 million by the end of 2020 

depreciation and amortization expense was 2703 million in 2019  an increase of approximately 287 million  or 119  from 2018  due primarily to the impact of acquisitions and the increase in capital expenditures relative to the prior year the provision for doubtful accounts was 149 million in 2019  a 22 million decrease from 2018  we believe the company is adequately reserved for bad debts at december 31 2019  

in addition the company approved and began to implement the 2019 cost savings plan discussed above which resulted in the recognition of 1122 million in restructuring costs that are accounted for as a component of operating expenses the restructuring costs are primarily associated with severance and other employee costs including a voluntary retirement program and facility and closure costs related to the consolidation of operations refer to the restructuring footnote in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

for the year ended december 31 2019 the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge related to its business products group totaling 820 million  s everal factors that developed in the fourth quarter of 2019 led to this charge including  i greater uncertainty associated with longterm industry trends and the competitive environment and ii fourth quarter results including segment profitability that were below management expectations due primarily to a reduction in volume with certain national account customers  management concluded that no other assets were impaired  refer to the goodwill and other intangible assets footnote in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

if there are sustained declines in macroeconomic or business conditions in future periods affecting the projected earnings and cash flows at our reporting units among other things there can be no assurance that goodwill at one or more reporting units may not be impaired nonetheless as of december 31 2019  we believe the remaining goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet is recoverable at each respective reporting unit 

nonoperating expenses and income 

nonoperating expenses included interest expense of 957 million in 2019 and 1019 million in 2018  the 62 million decrease in interest expense in 2019 reflects the combination of the repayment of debt throughout the year and lower interest rates on certain variable interest debt instruments to offset potential rising interest rates the company has entered into interest hedge products to increase our fixed interest rate debt relative to total debt 

the company recorded 428 million in special termination costs related to benefits provided through the companys defined benefit plans to employees that accepted the vrp package as part of the companys 2019 cost savings plan refer to the restructuring footnote in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

in “other” the net benefit of interest income equity method investment income investment dividends noncontrolling interests and pension income in 2019 was 660 million  an approximate 18 million decrease from the prior year primarily driven by lower interest income 

income before income taxes 

income before income taxes was 8303 million in 2019  down 228 from 2018  as a percentage of net sales income before income taxes was 43 in 2019 compared to 57 in 2018  adjusted for certain costs noted above and presented in nongaap measures below income before income taxes was relatively unchanged from the prior year at 11 billion and 57 of net sales 

income before income taxes is used as the measure of segment profit for each business segment segment profit is calculated as net sales less operating expenses excluding general corporate expenses interest expense equity in income from investees intangible asset amortization income attributable to noncontrolling interests and other unallocated amounts that are driven by corporate initiatives and adjusted in nongaap measures as described further below segment profit as a percent of revenues reflects the segment margin for each business segment 

automotive group 

automotives segment profit decreased 28 in 2019 from 2018 and segment margin was 76 in 2019 as compared to 81 in 2018  the decrease in segment margin reflects the loss of expense leverage due to the 23 growth in comparable sales for automotive as this group requires approximately 30 comparable sales growth to leverage its fixed costs in addition rising costs in several areas as described above negatively impacted automotives segment margin by geography the companys european automotive operations were most challenged in 2019 and primarily account for automotives decline in margin for the year to improve automotives segment margin this group is focused on several initiatives to grow sales and has also enhanced its cost management initiatives to drive savings in 2020 and the years ahead 

industrial group 

industrial’s segment profit increased 71 in 2019 from 2018 and segment margin was 80  an increase from 77 in 2018  the improvement in segment margin for this group primarily reflects the benefit of improved gross margins despite the slowing sales trend during the year and 17 comparable sales growth 2019 was a transformative year for industrial given the the addition of inenco in australasia and sale of eis the company believes that the industrial group is wellpositioned for further growth in 2020 

business products group 

business products segment profit was down 124 in 2019 from 2018 and segment margin decreased to 41 from 46  the decrease in segment margin primarily reflects the pressures associated with rising costs and the deleveraging of expenses due to the decrease in sales for this group caused by industry consolidation and incr eased competition nonetheless t he business products group enters 2020 focused on its core growth initiatives the further diversification of its business and the ongoing evaluation of options for new and enhanced opportunities to maximize the growth prospects for this business 

income taxes 

the effective income tax rate of 252 in 2019 increased from 246 in 2018  the increase in rate is primarily due to geographic income tax rate mix shifts and the impact of onetime transaction and other costs as well as changes in the realizability of future tax benefit adjustments recorded in the comparable periods 

net income 

net income was 6211 million in 2019  a decrease of 234 from 8105 million in 2018  on a per share diluted basis net income was 424 in 2019  down 229 compared to 550 in 2018  net income was 32 of net sales in 2019 compared to 43 of net sales in 2018  adjusted net income was 8332 million in 2019  down 03 from adjusted net income in 2018  on a per share diluted basis adjusted net income was 569  a 02 increase compared to adjusted diluted net income per share of 568 in 2018  adjusted net income and adjusted diluted net income per share both nongaap measures in 2019 and 2018 exclude those items noted above see nongaap measures below for more information and for a reconciliation to gaap 

nongaap measures 

the following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income and diluted net income per common share to adjusted net income and adjusted diluted net income per common share to account for the impact of adjustments the company believes that the presentation of adjusted net income and adjusted diluted net income per common share which are not calculated in accordance with gaap when considered together with the corresponding gaap financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the companys core operations the company considers these metrics useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management’s view and assessment of the company’s ongoing operating performance by removing items management believes are not representative of our continuing operations and may distort our longerterm operating trends we believe these measures to be useful to enhance the comparability of our results from period to period and with our competitors as well as to show ongoing results from operations distinct from items that are infrequent or not associated with the company’s core operations the company 

does not nor does it suggest investors should consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for gaap financial information

liquidity and capital resources 

the company’s sources of capital consist primarily of cash flows from operations supplemented as necessary by private issuances of debt and bank borrowings currently we believe that our cash on hand and available shortterm and longterm sources of capital are sufficient to fund the company’s operations including working capital requirements scheduled debt payments interest payments capital expenditures benefit plan contributions income tax obligations dividends share repurchases and contemplated acquisitions 

the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 124 to 1 at december 31 2019 and 128 to 1 at 2018  and our liquidity position remains solid we continue to negotiate extended payment dates with our vendors certain vendors participate in financing arrangements with financial institutions that allow the vendors to receive payment earlier while we pay the financial institution based on the underlying vendor invoice amounts and due dates the company’s total debt outstanding at december 31 2019 increased by 2828 million or 90 from december 31 2018  due primarily to additional private placement debt to fund various acquisitions

operating activities 

the company continues to generate cash and in 2019 net cash provided by operating activities totaled 8920 million  a 2532 million  or 221  decrease from 2018  the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the change in working capital in 2019 as compared to 2018 as the companys increase in accounts payable was less than in the prior year

due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with the company’s unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2019  the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities therefore 180 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above refer to the income taxes footnote in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes 

purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in our estimates we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements our purchase orders are based on our current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons the company does not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements 

the company guarantees the borrowings of certain independently owned automotive parts stores independents and certain other affiliates in which the company has a noncontrolling equity ownership interest affiliates the company’s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these independents and affiliates is generally equal to the total borrowings subject to the company’s guarantee to date the company has had no significant losses in connection with guarantees of independents’ and affiliates’ borrowings the following table shows the company’s approximate commercial commitments as of december 31 2019  

other commercial commitments 



in addition the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans that may obligate us to make contributions to the plans from time to time contributions in 2019 were 158 million  we expect to make 69 million in cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit plans in 2020 however contributions required for 2020 and future years will depend on a number of unpredictable factors including the market performance of the plans’ assets and future changes in interest rates that affect the actuarial measurement of the plans’ obligations 

share repurchases 

in 2019  the company repurchased approximately 08 million shares of its common stock and the company had remaining authority to purchase approximately 156 million shares of its common stock at december 31 2019  

critical accounting policies 

general 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we describe in this section certain critical accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates assumptions and judgments an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions 

about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially impact the consolidated financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for further information on the critical accounting policies see the summary of significant accounting policies footnote in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

inventories — provisions for slow moving and obsolescence 

the company identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates appropriate provisions related thereto historically these losses have not been significant as the vast majority of the company’s inventories are not highly susceptible to obsolescence and a majority are eligible for return under various vendor return programs while the company has no reason to believe its inventory return privileges will be discontinued in the future its risk of loss associated with obsolete or slow moving inventories would increase if such were to occur 

allowance for doubtful accounts — methodology 

the company evaluates the collectability of trade accounts receivable based on a combination of factors the company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on historical bad debt experience and periodically adjusts this estimate when the company becomes aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations eg bankruptcy filing or as a result of changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable while the company has a large customer base that is geographically dispersed a general economic downturn in any of the industry segments in which the company operates could result in higher than expected defaults and therefore the need to revise estimates for bad debts for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  the company recorded provisions for doubtful accounts of approximately 149 million  171 million  and 139 million  respectively 

consideration received from vendors 

the company may enter into agreements at the beginning of each year with many of its vendors that provide for inventory purchase incentives generally the company earns inventory purchase incentives upon achieving specified volume purchasing levels or other criteria the company accrues for the receipt of these incentives as part of its inventory cost based on cumulative purchases of inventory to date and projected inventory purchases through the end of the year while management believes the company will continue to receive consideration from vendors in 2020 and beyond there can be no assurance that vendors will continue to provide comparable amounts of incentives in the future or that we will be able to achieve the specified volumes necessary to take advantage of such incentives 

impairment of property plant and equipment and goodwill and other intangible assets 

at least annually the company evaluates property plant and equipment goodwill and other intangible assets for potential impairment indicators the company’s judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance among other factors future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired evaluating for impairment also requires the company to estimate future operating results and cash flows which requires judgment by management any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and results of operations refer to the goodwill and other intangible assets footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on the results of the companys annual goodwill impairment testing 

employee benefit plans 

the company’s benefit plan committees in the us and canada establish investment policies and strategies and regularly monitor the performance of the company’s pension plan assets the plans in europe are unfunded and therefore there are no plan assets the pension plan investment strategy implemented by the company’s management is to achieve longterm objectives and invest the pension assets in accordance with the applicable pension legislation in the us and canada as well as fiduciary standards the longterm primary objectives for the pension plan funds are to provide for a reasonable amount of longterm growth of capital without undue exposure to risk protect the assets from erosion of purchasing power and provide investment results that meet or exceed the pension plans’ actuarially assumed longterm rates of return the company’s investment strategy with respect to pension plan assets is to generate a return in excess of the passive portfolio benchmark 47 sp 500 index 5 russell mid cap index 7 russell 2000 index 5 msci eafe index 5 dj global moderate index 3 msci emerging market net and 28 barclays us long govtcredit 

we make several critical assumptions in determining our pension plan assets and liabilities and related pension income we believe the most critical of these assumptions are the expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate other assumptions we make relate to employee demographic factors such as rate of compensation increases mortality rates retirement patterns and turnover rates refer to the employee benefit plans footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding these assumptions 

based on the investment policy for the pension plans as well as an asset study that was performed based on the company’s asset allocations and future expectations the company’s expected rate of return on plan assets for measuring 2020 pension income is 711 for the plans the asset study forecasted expected rates of return for the approximate duration of the company’s benefit obligations using capital market data and historical relationships 

the discount rate is chosen as the rate at which pension obligations could be effectively settled and is based on capital market conditions as of the measurement date we have matched the timing and duration of the expected cash flows of our pension obligations to a yield curve generated from a broad portfolio of highquality fixed income debt instruments to select our discount rate based upon this cash flow matching analysis we selected a weighted average discount rate for the plans of 34 at december 31 2019  

net periodic benefit income for our defined benefit pension plans was 162 million  158 million  and 126 million for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively the income associated with the pension plans in 2019  2018 and 2017 reflects the impact of the hard freeze effective december 31 2013 no further benefits were provided after this date for additional credited service or earnings and all participants became fully vested as of december 31 2013 refer to the employee benefit plans footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding employee benefit plans 

business combinations 

when the company acquires businesses it applies the acquisition method of accounting and recognizes the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree at their fair values on the acquisition date which requires significant estimates and assumptions goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed the acquisition method requires the company to record provisional amounts for any items for which the accounting is not complete at the end of a reporting period the company must complete the accounting during the measurement period which cannot exceed one year adjustments made during the measurement period could have a material impact on the companys financial condition and results of operations 

the company typically measures customer relationship and other intangible assets using an income approach significant estimates and assumptions used in this approach include discount rates and certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted cash flows expected to be generated from the asset eg future revenue growth rates operating margins and attrition rates if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values the company could record impairment charges in addition the company has estimated the economic lives of certain acquired tangible and intangible assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense if the companys estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could be increased or decreased or the acquired asset could be impaired 

legal and product liabilities 

the company accrues for potential losses related to legal disputes litigation product liabilities and regulatory matters when it is probable more likely than not that the company will incur a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 

to calculate product liabilities the company estimates potential losses relating to pending claims and also estimates the likelihood of additional similar claims being filed against the company in the future to estimate potential losses on claims that could be filed in the future the company considers claims pending against the company claim filing rates the number of codefendants and the extent to which they share in settlements and the amount of loss by claim type the estimated losses for pending and potential future claims are calculated on a discounted basis using riskfree interest rates derived from market data about monetary assets with maturities comparable to those of the projected product liabilities the company uses an actuarial specialist to assist with measuring its product liabilities refer to the commitments and contingencies footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding product liabilities 

self insurance 

the company is selfinsured for the majority of its group health insurance costs a reserve for claims incurred but not reported is developed by analyzing historical claims data provided by the company’s claims administrators these reserves are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as the expenses are expected to be paid within one year 

longterm insurance liabilities consist primarily of reserves for the companys workers’ compensation program in addition the company carries various large risk deductible workers’ compensation policies for the majority of workers’ compensation liabilities the company records the workers’ compensation reserves based on an analysis performed by an independent actuary the analysis calculates development factors which are applied to total reserves as provided by the various insurance companies who underwrite the program while the company believes that the assumptions used to calculate these liabilities are appropriate 

significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect workers’ compensation costs 

income taxes 

the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amount and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded net as noncurrent deferred income taxes in addition valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized in making this determination the company considers all available positive and negative evidence including projected future taxable income future reversals of existing temporary differences recent financial operations and tax planning strategies 

the company recognizes a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits

quarterly results of operations 

the following is a summary of the quarterly results of operations for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  





during the fourth quarter of 2019 we approved and began to implement the 2019 cost savings plan which resulted in recognizing 1549 million in total restructuring costs and special termination costs primarily due to planned workforce reductions and facility closures and consolidations also in the fourth quarter of 2019 we recorded a goodwill impairment charge related to the business products reporting unit totaling 820 million  refer to the restructuring footnote and the goodwill and other intangible assets footnote in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

we recorded the quarterly earnings per share amounts as if each quarter was a discrete period as a result the sum of the basic and diluted earnings per share will not necessarily total the annual basic and diluted earnings per share 

the preparation of interim consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the amounts reported in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements specifically the company makes estimates and assumptions in its interim condensed consolidated financial statements for inventory adjustments the accrual of bad debts the accrual of insurance reserves customer sales returns and volume incentives earned among others inventory adjustments including adjustments for a majority of inventories that are valued under the lastin firstout lifo method are accrued on an interim basis and adjusted in the fourth quarter based on the annual book to physical inventory adjustment and lifo valuation which is performed each yearend reserves for bad debts insurance and customer sales returns are estimated and accrued on an interim 

basis based upon historical experience volume incentives are estimated based upon cumulative and projected purchasing levels income taxes are estimated on an interim basis to reflect the impact of tax reform assumptions and other considerations the estimates and assumptions for interim reporting may change upon final determination at yearend and such changes may be significant the effect of these adjustments in 2019 and 2018 was not significant 




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  

although the company does not face material risks related to commodity prices the company is exposed to changes in interest rates and in foreign currency rates with respect to foreign currency denominated operating revenues and expenses 

foreign currency 

the company incurs translation gains or losses resulting from the translation of an operating unit’s foreign functional currency into us dollars for consolidated financial statement purposes for the periods presented the company’s principal foreign currency exchange exposures are the euro the functional currency of our european operations the canadian dollar the functional currency of our canadian operations and the australian dollar the functional currency of our australasian operations we monitor our foreign currency exposures and from time to time we enter into currency forward contracts to manage our exposure to currency fluctuations foreign currency exchange exposure particularly in regard to the canadian and australian dollar and to a lesser extent the euro negatively impacted our results for the year ended december 31 2019  foreign currency exchange exposure particularly in regard to the canadian and australian dollar and to a lesser extent the euro and mexican peso positively impacted our results for the year ended december 31 2018 

during 2019 and 2018  it was estimated that a 10 shift in exchange rates between those foreign functional currencies and the us dollar would have impacted translated net sales by approximately 513 million and 486 million respectively a 15 shift in exchange rates between those functional currencies and the us dollar would have impacted translated net sales by approximately 770 million in 2019 and 729 million in 2018  a 20 shift in exchange rates between those functional currencies and the us dollar would have impacted translated net sales by approximately 1026 million in 2019 and 972 million in 2018  

interest rates 

the company is subject to interest rate volatility with regard to existing and future issuances of debt we monitor our mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt as well as our mix of shortterm debt and longterm debt from time to time we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations based on the companys variablerate debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of december 31 2019 and 2018 we estimate that a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by 55 million in 2019 and 12 million in 2018 however these increases in interest expense would have been partially offset by the increases in interest income related to higher interest rates

forwardlooking statements are only as of the date they are made and the company undertakes no duty to update its forwardlooking statements except as required by law you are advised however to review any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our subsequent forms 10q 8k and other reports filed with the sec 

set forth below are the material risks and uncertainties that if they were to occur could materially and adversely affect our business or could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements in this report and in the other public statements we make please be aware that these risks may change over time and other risks may prove to be important in the future new risks may emerge at any time and we cannot predict such risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our business financial condition results of operations or the trading price of our securities 

we may not be able to successfully implement our business initiatives in each of our three business segments to grow our sales and earnings which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have implemented numerous initiatives in each of our three business segments to grow sales and earnings including the introduction of new and expanded product lines strategic acquisitions geographic expansion including through acquisitions sales to new markets enhanced customer marketing programs and a variety of gross margin and cost savings initiatives if we are unable to implement these initiatives efficiently and effectively or if these initiatives are unsuccessful our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

successful implementation of these initiatives also depends on factors specific to the automotive parts industry and the other industries in which we operate and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control in addition to the other risk factors contained in this “item 1a risk factors” adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our business initiatives and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 our business will be adversely affected if demand for our products slows 

our business depends on customer demand for the products that we distribute demand for these products depends on many factors 

with respect to our automotive group the primary factors are 

 with respect to our industrial parts group the primary factors are 



 with respect to our business products group the primary factors are 

 changes in legislation or government regulations or policies could have a significant impact on our results of operations 

certain political developments including among others i the results of elections in the us and globally and the impact of such results on political decisionmaking and ii unrest in the uk and europe have resulted in increased economic uncertainty for multinational companies operating within the uk and europe these developments may result in economic and trade policy actions that could impact economic conditions in many countries and change the landscape of international trade our business is global so changes to existing international trade agreements blocking of foreign trade or imposition of tariffs on foreign goods could result in decreased revenues andor increases in pricing either of which could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows in future periods in addition the tax cuts and jobs act the act was signed into law on december 22 2017 the act which reduces the us corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 requires companies to pay a onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings 

the uks referendum to exit from the european union “eu” will continue to have uncertain effects and could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

on june 23 2016 the uk voted to exit from the eu commonly referred to as “brexit” the terms of brexit and the resulting ukeu relationship are uncertain for companies doing business both in the uk and the overall global economy the uk vote has impacted global markets including various currencies and resulted in a sharp decline in the value of the british pound as compared to the us dollar and other major currencies the fluctuation of currency exchange rates may expose us to gains and losses on nonus currency transactions volatility in the securities markets and in currency exchange rates may continue as the uk negotiates its exit from the eu while we have not experienced any material financial impact from brexit on our business to date we cannot predict its future implications any impact from brexit on our business and operations over the long term will depend in part on the outcome of tariff tax treaties trade regulatory and other negotiations the uk conducts 

uncertainty andor deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions domestically and globally including unemployment inflation or deflation changes in tax policies changes in energy costs uncertain credit markets or other economic conditions could have a negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our business and operating results have been and may in the future be adversely affected by uncertain global economic conditions including domestic outputs political uncertainty and unrest employment rates inflation or deflation changes in tax policies instability in credit markets declining consumer and business confidence fluctuating commodity prices interest rates volatile exchange rates and other challenges that could affect the global economy both our commercial and retail customers may experience deterioration of their financial resources which could result in existing or potential customers delaying or canceling plans to purchase our products our vendors could experience similar negative conditions which could impact their ability to fulfill their financial obligations to us future weakness in the global economy could adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we face substantial competition in the industries in which we do business 

the sale of automotive parts industrial parts and business products is highly competitive and impacted by many factors including name recognition product availability customer service changing customer preferences store location and pricing 

pressures because we seek to offer competitive prices if our competitors reduce their prices we may be forced to reduce our prices which could result in a material decline in our revenues and earnings increased competition among distributors of automotive industrial parts and office products including increased availability among digital and ecommerce providers across the markets in which we do business could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations the company anticipates no decline in competition in any of its three business segments in the foreseeable future 

in particular the market for replacement automotive parts is highly competitive and subjects us to a wide variety of competitors we compete primarily with national international and regional auto parts chains independently owned regional and local automotive parts and accessories stores automobile dealers that supply manufacturer replacement parts and accessories mass merchandisers internet providers and wholesale clubs that sell automotive products and regional and local full service automotive repair shops both new and established 

furthermore both the automotive aftermarket and the office supply industries continue to experience consolidation consolidation among our competitors could further enhance their financial position provide them with the ability to offer more competitive prices to customers for whom we compete and allow them to achieve increased efficiencies in their consolidated operations that enable them to more effectively compete for customers if we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies or if our competitors develop more effective strategies we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

in addition the loss of a major customer in the business products group could significantly impact its results of operations 

we depend on our relationships with our vendors and a disruption of our vendor relationships or a disruption in our vendors’ operations could harm our business 

as a distributor of automotive parts industrial parts and business products our business depends on developing and maintaining close and productive relationships with our vendors we depend on our vendors to sell us quality products at favorable prices many factors outside our control including without limitation raw material shortages inadequate manufacturing capacity labor disputes tariff legislation transportation disruptions tax and other legislative uncertainties andor weather conditions could adversely affect our vendors’ ability to deliver to us quality merchandise at favorable prices in a timely manner 

 furthermore financial or operational difficulties with a particular vendor could cause that vendor to increase the cost of the products or decrease the quality of the products we purchase from it vendor consolidation could also limit the number of suppliers from which we may purchase products and could materially affect the prices we pay for these products in addition we would suffer an adverse impact if our vendors limit or cancel the return privileges that currently protect us from inventory obsolescence 

we recognize the growing demand for businesstobusiness and businesstocustomer digital and ecommerce options and solutions and we could lose business if we fail to provide the digital and ecommerce options and solutions our customers wish to use 

our success in digital and ecommerce depends on our ability to accurately identify the products to make available through digital and ecommerce platforms across our business segments and to establish and maintain such platforms to provide an efficient online experience with the highest level of data security to our customers on and through the platforms our customers wish to use including mobile with rapidly changing technology in a highly competitive environment 

if we experience a security breach if our internal information systems fail to function properly or if we are unsuccessful in implementing integrating or upgrading our information systems our business operations could be materially affected 

we depend on information systems to process customer orders manage inventory and accounts receivable collections purchase products manage accounts payable processes ship products to customers on a timely basis maintain cost effective operations provide superior service to customers and accumulate financial results among many other things despite our implementation of security measures our it systems and operations could be subject to damages or interruptions from computer viruses natural disasters unauthorized physical or electronic access power outages telecommunications failure computer system or network failures wire transfer failure employee errormalfeasance cyberattacks security breaches and other similar disruptions additionally the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyberattacks and breaches of it systems change frequently and have the potential to not be recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time maintaining operating and protecting these systems and related personal information about our employees customers and suppliers requires continuous investments in physical and technological security measures employee training and thirdparty services which the company has made and will continue to make a security breach could result in among other things sensitive and confidential data being lost manipulated or exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public or delay our ability to process customer orders and manage inventory while we also seek to obtain assurances from third parties with whom we interact to protect confidential information there are risks that the confidentiality or accessibility of data held or utilized by such third parties may be compromised 

a serious prolonged disruption of our information systems for any of the above reasons could materially impair fundamental business processes and increase expenses decrease sales or otherwise impact earnings and cash flows furthermore such a breach may harm our reputation and business prospects and subject us to legal claims if there is loss disclosure or misappropriation of or access to our customers’ information as the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and use and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous compliance with these requirements could also result in significant additional costs as threats related to cybersecurity breaches grow more sophisticated and frequent it may become more difficult to timely detect and protect our data and infrastructure 

because we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees and other costs 

we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers employees or other third parties for various reasons the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

additionally we are subject to numerous laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate as well as governmental regulations relating to taxes environmental protection product quality standards building and zoning requirements and employment law matters if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs in addition our capital expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations 

we are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key persons could harm our business 

our future success significantly depends on the continued services and performance of our key management personnel we believe our management team’s depth and breadth of experience in our industry is integral to executing our business plan we also will need to continue to attract motivate and retain other key personnel the loss of services of members of our senior management team or other key employees the inability to attract additional qualified personnel as needed or failure to plan for the succession of senior management and key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our debt levels could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations 

we have an unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured senior notes which could have important consequences to our financial health for example our level of indebtedness could among other things 

• make it more difficult to satisfy our financial obligations including those relating to the senior unsecured notes and our credit facility 

• increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions 

• limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes and opportunities in our industry which may place us at a competitive disadvantage 

• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows to service the principal and interest on the debt reducing the funds available for other business purposes such as working capital capital expenditures or other cash requirements

net sales for the industrial parts group “industrial” were 63 billion in 2018  up 85 from 2017  the increase in sales for the year reflects an approximate 65 comparable sales increase and an approximate 2 contribution from acquisitions total industrial sales were also positively impacted by product inflation of 38 as a portion of this increase depending on its effective date is passed through to customers and is included in the comparable sales increase industrial revenues were up approximately 8 in the first quarter of 2018 up 9 in the second quarter up 8 in the third quarter and up 9 in the fourth quarter these strong quarterly increases correlate to the ongoing strength in the industrial economy throughout the year this was evidenced by favorable economic indicators such as manufacturing industrial production the purchasing managers index the level of exports and the continued stabilization of the energy sector we believe the industrial business is well positioned for ongoing profitable growth in 2019 

net sales for industrial were 58 billion in 2017  up 75 from 2016  the increase in sales for the year reflects an approximate 4 comparable sales increase a 33 contribution from acquisitions and a slight positive impact of currency translation associated with our canadian and mexican operations industrials sales were also positively impacted by product inflation of 19 as a portion of this increase is passed through to customers and is included in the comparable sales increase industrial revenues were up approximately 6 in the first quarter of 2017  and up 8 in the second third and fourth quarters which correlates to the strength in the industrial economy throughout the year 

business products group 

net sales for sp richards our business products group “business products” were 19 billion in 2018  a decrease of 05 from 2017  the decrease in sales is driven by the decline in core sales and is the result of a slow first quarter relative to the balance of the year sales were down approximately 5 in the first quarter flat in the second quarter up 1 in the third quarter and up 2 in the fourth quarter of 2018  while the business products industry continues to face significant challenges our strategy to diversify our traditional product offering into the large and growing facilities breakroom and safety supplies fbs category has proven beneficial in addition sales in our general office supplies category were improved in the second half of 2018 looking ahead we remain focused on our core growth initiatives and maximizing the growth prospects for our diversified business but will also continue to evaluate all opportunities that may help us more effectively navigate the evolving industry dynamics in which this group competes

in 2018  and 2017  each of the companys business segments experienced vendor price increases while in 2016  only the industrial and business products segments experienced vendor price increases in any year where we experience price increases we are able to work with our customers to pass most of these increases along to them 

operating expenses 

the company includes in selling administrative and other expenses “sga” all personnel and personnelrelated costs at its headquarters distribution centers stores and branches which accounts for approximately 65 of total sga additional costs in sga include our facilities delivery marketing advertising technology digital legal and professional costs 

sga of 46 billion  in 2018  increased by 889 million  or approximately 239  from 2017  this represents 246 of net sales in 2018 compared to 228 of net sales in 2017  the increase in sga expenses from the prior year reflect a combination of factors including the impact of increased sales for the year in addition our expenses reflect the impact of higher cost and higher gross margin models at select acquisitions including aag we also experienced rising costs in areas such as labor freight and delivery technology and warehousing further we incurred incremental costs associated with our 23 acquisitions during the year and in addition recorded 303 million in transaction and other costs primarily associated with the acquisition of aag and the attempted transaction to spinoff the companys business products group net of the favorable impact of a termination fee received the increase in sga expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2018 from the prior year reflect the increases in costs described above as well as the loss of leverage associated with the first half and full year comparable sales growth in the automotive and business products businesses respectively to improve on our sga expense levels we continue to work towards a lower cost but highly effective infrastructure these efforts include steps to accelerate the integration of our acquisitions investments to enhance our productivity and innovative strategies to unlock greater savings and efficiencies across our operations

in “other” the net benefit of interest income equity method investment income investment dividends noncontrolling interests and pension income in 2018  was 68 million  a 16 million  increase from the prior year the increase in other reflects higher interest income pension income and investments income earned in 2018 relative to 2017 these items totaled 52 million in 2017  a 5 million increase from 2016  due to higher investment income and interest income relative to the prior year 

income before income taxes 

income before income taxes was 11 billion  in 2018  up 7  from 2017  as a percentage of net sales income before income taxes which we refer to as operating margin was 57  in 2018  compared to 62 in 2017  adjusted for 361 million in transaction and other costs primarily associated with the companys acquisition of aag on november 2 2017 and the attempted transaction to spinoff the companys business products group net of the favorable impact of a termination fee received income before income taxes was 59 of net sales in 2017  income before income taxes was 10 billion down 6 from 2016  and as a percentage of net sales was 62 compared to 70 in 2016  adjusted for 491 million in transactionrelated costs primarily associated with the companys acquisition of aag described above income before income taxes was 65 of net sales 

automotive group 

automotive income before income taxes increased 186 in 2018 from 2017 and operating margin was 81 in 2018  as compared to 84 in 2017  the decrease in operating margin reflects the loss of expense leverage due to the 25 growth in comparable sales for automotive as this group requires approximately 3 comparable sales growth to leverage its fixed costs in addition rising costs in several areas as described above negatively impacted automotives operating margin to improve automotives operating margin this group is focused on several initiatives to grow sales and has also enhanced its cost management initiatives to drive savings in 2019 and the years ahead 

automotive’s income before income taxes increased 07 in 2017 and operating margin of 84 was down from 88 in 2016  the decrease in operating margin primarily reflects the loss of expense leverage due to 1 growth in comparable sales for automotive 

industrial group 

industrial’s income before income taxes increased 106 in 2018 from 2017 and operating margin was 77 an increase from 76 in 2017  the improvement in operating margin for this group primarily reflects the continued benefit of strong sales growth throughout the year as gross margins benefited from the increase in supplier incentives and rebates and operating expenses were better leveraged we believe that industrial enters 2019 in position to further expand their operating margin 

industrial’s income before income taxes increased 109 in 2017 and operating margin was 76 which was up from 74 in 2016  the improvement in operating margin for this group primarily reflects the positive impact of stronger sales growth in 2017  relative to 2016  driven by an improved industrial economy 

business products group 

business products income before income tax was down 102 in 2018 from 2017 and operating margin decreased to 46 from 51 the decrease in operating margin reflects the gross margin pressures associated with lower supplier incentives as well as increased costs and the deleveraging of expenses due to comparable sales declines the business products group enters 2019 focused on its core growth initiatives the further diversification of its business and the evaluation of options for new and enhanced opportunities to maximize the growth prospects for this business 

business products income before income taxes was down 155 in 2017 from 2016 and operating margin decreased to 51 from 59 as gross margin pressures rising costs and the deleveraging of expenses negatively impacted the operating margin for this business 

income taxes 

the tax cuts and jobs act the act was enacted december 22 2017 while not all inclusive certain provisions of the act materially impact the company the act reduces the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 for taxable years starting after december 31 2017 required companies to pay a onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were not previously subject to us federal income tax and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings 

the effective income tax rate of 246  in 2018  decreased from 389 in 2017  the decrease in rate primarily reflects the positive impact of the lower us federal tax rate described above and the comparative benefit associated with the transition tax expense in 2017 as required by the the act 

the effective income tax rate of   389  in 2017  increased from 360 in 2016  the increase in the 2017 rate reflects the 51 million tax expense related to the transition tax associated with foreign earnings and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities as required by the act offset by a favorable mix of us and foreign earnings including earnings from aag 

net income 

net income was 8105 million  in 2018  an increase of 314  from 617 million in 2017  on a per share diluted basis net income was 550  in 2018  up 316  compared to 418 in 2017  net income was 43  of net sales in 2018  compared to 38 of net sales in 2017  adjusted net income was 8361 million  in 2018  up 202 from adjusted net income in 2017  on a per share diluted basis adjusted net income was 568  a 206 increase compared to adjusted diluted net income per share of 471 in 2017  adjusted net income and adjusted diluted net income per share both nongaap measures in 2018 and 2017 exclude the impact of transaction and other costs primarily related to the companys acquisition of aag and the attempted transaction to spinoff the business products group net of the favorable impact of a termination fee received in 2017 adjusted net income also excludes the impact of the onetime transition tax associated with foreign earnings and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities as required by the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 

net income was 617 million in 2017  a decrease of 103 from 687 million in 2016  on a per share diluted basis net income was 418 in 2017  down 89 compared to 459 in 2016  net income was 38 of net sales in 2017  compared to 45 of net sales in 2016  

nongaap measures 

the following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income and diluted net income per common share to adjusted net income and adjusted diluted net income per common share to account for the impact of these adjustments the company believes that the presentation of adjusted net income and adjusted net income per common share which are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us “gaap” provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the companys core operations the company does not nor does it suggest investors should consider such nongaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for gaap financial information 



financial condition 

the company’s cash balance of 334 million  at december 31 2018  compares to cash of 315 million at december 31 2017  as discussed further below for the year ended december 31 2018 the company used 278 million for acquisitions and other investing activities 416 million for dividends paid to the company’s shareholders and 232 million for investments in the company via capital expenditures these items were offset by the company’s earnings and net cash provided by operating activities 

accounts receivable at december 31 2018  increased by approximately 3  from the prior year which is due to the companys higher sales volume in the three month period ended december 31 2018 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 inventory at december 31 2018  decreased from the prior year by approximately 4  due primarily to a change in classification of certain estimated merchandise returns in connection with adopting asu 201409 accounts payable increased 10  from the prior year primarily due to more favorable payment terms negotiated with the companys vendors as well as more normalized levels of purchasing volumes relative to the fourth quarter of the prior year 

liquidity and capital resources 

the company’s sources of capital consist primarily of cash flows from operations supplemented as necessary by private issuances of debt and bank borrowings currently we believe that our cash on hand and available shortterm and longterm sources of capital are sufficient to fund the company’s operations including working capital requirements scheduled debt payments interest payments capital expenditures benefit plan contributions income tax obligations dividends share repurchases and contemplated acquisitions 

the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 13  to 1 at both december 31 2018  and 2017  and our liquidity position remains solid we continue to negotiate extended payment dates with our vendors certain vendors participate in financing arrangements with financial institutions that allow the vendors to receive payment earlier while we pay the financial institution based on the underlying vendor invoice amounts and due dates the company’s total debt outstanding at december 31 2018  decreased by 102 million  or 3  from december 31 2017  due primarily to improvements in working capital 

sources and uses of cash 

a summary of the company’s consolidated statements of cash flows is as follows 





operating activities 

the company continues to generate cash and in 2018  net cash provided by operating activities totaled 11 billion  this reflects a 330 million  or 41  increase from 2017  and is primarily related to the company’s ongoing working capital initiatives and the increase in the company’s net income during 2018 the primary source of cash relates to the company’s increased payables that are a result of ongoing strategic negotiations with key suppliers in addition the company achieved a 194 million  increase in net income or 31  increase from 2017 

net cash provided by operating activities was 815 million  in 2017  a 14 decrease from 2016  and represents the lower source of cash from trade accounts receivable merchandise inventories trade accounts payable and other short term assets and liabilities collectively relative to 2016  other changes in operating activities were essentially offsetting 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 496 million  in 2018  compared to 16 billion  in 2017  a 11 billion  or 70  decrease cash used for acquisitions of businesses and other investing activities in 2018  was 278 million  or 12 billion  less than in 2017  the decrease in 2018 reflects the companys smaller acquisitions as compared to the purchase of aag in 2017 capital expenditures of 232 million  in 2018  compare to 157 million in 2017  and were higher than our original estimate of 200 to 220 million for the year due to the timing of certain capitalized investments we estimate that cash used for capital expenditures in 2019 will be approximately 300 to 325 million 

net cash used in investing activities was 163 billion in 2017  compared to 594 million  in 2016  a 10 billion  or 174  increase cash used for acquisitions of businesses and other investing activities in 2017  was 15 billion  or 10 billion more than in 2016  primarily this increase reflects the companys purchase of aag capital expenditures of 157 million in 2017  compare to 161 million in 2016  and were within the range of our original estimate of 145 to 165 million for the year 

financing activities 

 net cash used in financing activities in 2018  totaled 609 million  a decrease of 15 billion  or 170  from the 872 million  in cash provided by financing activities in 2017  the decrease reflects no new debt issuance in 2018 and the paying down of our credit facilities net cash provided by financing activities in 2017  was up 370  from the 322 million  used in 2016  and primarily reflects the new debt issued in 2017 associated with the purchase of aag for the three years presented the companys financing activities included the use of cash for dividends paid to shareholders and repurchases of the company’s common stock the company paid dividends to shareholders of 416 million  395 million and 387 million during 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively the company expects this trend of increasing dividends to continue in the foreseeable future during 2018  2017  and 2016  the company repurchased 92 million  174 million and 181 million respectively of the company’s common stock we expect to remain active in our share repurchase program but the amount and value of shares repurchased will vary 

notes and other borrowings 

the company maintains a 26 billion multicurrency syndicated facility agreement the syndicated facility with a consortium of financial institutions which matures in october 2022 and bears interest at london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin which is based on the company’s debt to earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization ebitda ratio the company also has the option to increase the borrowing capacity up to an additional 1 billion as well as an option to decrease the borrowing capacity or terminate the facility with appropriate notice at december 31 2018  approximately 16 billion was outstanding under this line of credit due to the workers’ compensation and insurance reserve requirements in certain states the company also had unused letters of credit of approximately 64 million  and 62 million outstanding at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively 

at december 31 2018  the company had unsecured senior notes outstanding under financing arrangement as follows 50 million series g senior unsecured notes 264 fixed due 2021 250 million series f senior unsecured notes 324 fixed due 2023 €225 million series j senior unsecured notes 140 fixed maturing on october 30 2024 250 million series h senior unsecured notes 324 fixed due 2026 €250 million series k senior unsecured notes 181 fixed maturing on october 30 2027 120 million series i senior unsecured notes 370 fixed maturing on october 30 2027 €125 million series l senior unsecured notes 202 fixed maturing on october 30 2029 and €100 million series m senior unsecured notes 232 fixed maturing on october 30 2032 these borrowings contain covenants related to a maximum debt to ebitda ratio and certain 

limitations on additional borrowings at december 31 2018  the company was in compliance with all such covenants the weighted average interest rate on the company’s total outstanding borrowings was approximately 271 at december 31 2018  and 270 at december 31 2017  total interest expense net of interest income for all borrowings was 921 million 387 million and 195 million in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively 

contractual and other obligations 

the following table shows the company’s approximate obligations and commitments including interest due on credit facilities to make future payments under specified contractual obligations as of december 31 2018  

contractual obligations 



due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with the company’s unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2018  the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities therefore 21 million of unrecognized tax benefits and the remaining 30 million onetime transition tax related to the tax cuts and jobs act have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above refer to the income taxes footnote in the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes 

purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in our estimates we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements our purchase orders are based on our current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons the company does not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements 

the company guarantees the borrowings of certain independently owned automotive parts stores independents and certain other affiliates in which the company has a noncontrolling equity ownership interest affiliates the company’s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these independents and affiliates is generally equal to the total borrowings subject to the company’s guarantee to date the company has had no significant losses in connection with guarantees of independents’ and affiliates’ borrowings the following table shows the company’s approximate commercial commitments as of december 31 2018  

other commercial commitments 



in addition the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans that may obligate us to make contributions to the plans from time to time contributions in 2018  were 575 million  we expect to make 60 million  in cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit plans in 2019 however contributions required for 2019 and future years will depend on a number of unpredictable factors including the market performance of the plans’ assets and future changes in interest rates that affect the actuarial measurement of the plans’ obligations 

share repurchases 

in 2018  the company repurchased approximately 10 million shares of its common stock and the company had remaining authority to purchase approximately 164 million shares of its common stock at december 31 2018  

critical accounting policies 

general 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we describe in this section certain critical accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates assumptions and judgments an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially impact the consolidated financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for further information on the critical accounting policies see the summary of significant accounting policies footnote in the consolidated financial statements 

inventories — provisions for slow moving and obsolescence 

the company identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates appropriate provisions related thereto historically these losses have not been significant as the vast majority of the company’s inventories are not highly susceptible to obsolescence and a majority are eligible for return under various vendor return programs while the company has no reason to believe its inventory return privileges will be discontinued in the future its risk of loss associated with obsolete or slow moving inventories would increase if such were to occur 

allowance for doubtful accounts — methodology 

the company evaluates the collectability of trade accounts receivable based on a combination of factors the company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on historical bad debt experience and periodically adjusts this estimate when the company becomes aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations eg bankruptcy filing or as a result of changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable while the company has a large customer base that is geographically dispersed a general economic downturn in any of the industry segments in which the company operates could result in higher than expected defaults and therefore the need to revise estimates for bad debts for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  the company recorded provisions for doubtful accounts of approximately 171 million  139 million and 115 million respectively 

consideration received from vendors 

the company may enter into agreements at the beginning of each year with many of its vendors that provide for inventory purchase incentives generally the company earns inventory purchase incentives upon achieving specified volume purchasing levels or other criteria the company accrues for the receipt of these incentives as part of its inventory cost based on cumulative purchases of inventory to date and projected inventory purchases through the end of the year while management believes the company will continue to receive consideration from vendors in 2019 and beyond there can be no assurance that vendors will continue to provide comparable amounts of incentives in the future or that we will be able to achieve the specified volumes necessary to take advantage of such incentives 

impairment of property plant and equipment and goodwill and other intangible assets 

at least annually the company evaluates property plant and equipment goodwill and other intangible assets for potential impairment indicators the company’s judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance among other factors future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired evaluating for impairment also requires the company to estimate future operating results and cash flows which requires judgment by management any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

employee benefit plans 

the company’s benefit plan committees in the us and canada establish investment policies and strategies and regularly monitor the performance of the company’s pension plan assets the plans in europe are unfunded and therefore there are no plan assets the pension plan investment strategy implemented by the company’s management is to achieve longterm objectives and invest the pension assets in accordance with the applicable pension legislation in the us and canada as well as fiduciary standards the longterm primary objectives for the pension plan funds are to provide for a reasonable amount of longterm growth of capital 

without undue exposure to risk protect the assets from erosion of purchasing power and provide investment results that meet or exceed the pension plans’ actuarially assumed longterm rates of return the company’s investment strategy with respect to pension plan assets is to generate a return in excess of the passive portfolio benchmark 47 sp 500 index 5 russell mid cap index 7 russell 2000 index 5 msci eafe index 5 dj global moderate index 3 msci emerging market net and 28 barcap us govtcredit 

we make several critical assumptions in determining our pension plan assets and liabilities and related pension income we believe the most critical of these assumptions are the expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate other assumptions we make relate to employee demographic factors such as rate of compensation increases mortality rates retirement patterns and turnover rates refer to note 10 of the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding these assumptions 

based on the investment policy for the pension plans as well as an asset study that was performed based on the company’s asset allocations and future expectations the company’s expected rate of return on plan assets for measuring 2019 pension income is 712 for the plans the asset study forecasted expected rates of return for the approximate duration of the company’s benefit obligations using capital market data and historical relationships 

the discount rate is chosen as the rate at which pension obligations could be effectively settled and is based on capital market conditions as of the measurement date we have matched the timing and duration of the expected cash flows of our pension obligations to a yield curve generated from a broad portfolio of highquality fixed income debt instruments to select our discount rate based upon this cash flow matching analysis we selected a weighted average discount rate for the plans of 436 at december 31 2018  

net periodic benefit income for our defined benefit pension plans was 158 million  126 million and 134 million for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively the income associated with the pension plans in 2018  2017  and 2016  reflects the impact of the hard freeze effective december 31 2013 no further benefits were provided after this date for additional credited service or earnings and all participants became fully vested as of december 31 2013 refer to note 10 of the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding employee benefit plans 

business combinations 

from time to time the company may enter into business combinations the company generally recognizes the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree at their fair values as of the date of acquisition the company measures goodwill as the excess of consideration transferred which the company also measures at fair value over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed the acquisition method of accounting requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition including the fair values of identifiable intangible assets deferred tax asset valuation allowances liabilities including those related to debt pensions and other postretirement plans uncertain tax positions contingent consideration and contingencies this method also requires the company to refine these estimates over a measurement period not to exceed one year to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that if known would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date if the company is required to adjust provisional amounts that it has recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions these adjustments could have a material impact on the the companys financial condition and results of operations 

significant estimates and assumptions in estimating the fair value of acquired customer relationships and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that the company expects to generate from the acquired assets if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values the company could record impairment charges in addition the company has estimated the economic lives of certain acquired tangible and intangible assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense if the companys estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could be increased or decreased or the acquired asset could be impaired 

self insurance 

the company is selfinsured for the majority of group health insurance costs a reserve for claims incurred but not reported is developed by analyzing historical claims data provided by the company’s claims administrators these reserves are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as the expenses are expected to be paid within one year 

longterm insurance liabilities consist primarily of reserves for the workers’ compensation program in addition the company carries various large risk deductible workers’ compensation policies for the majority of workers’ compensation liabilities the company records the workers’ compensation reserves based on an analysis performed by an independent actuary the analysis calculates development factors which are applied to total reserves as provided by the various insurance companies who underwrite the program while the company believes that the assumptions used to calculate these liabilities are appropriate significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect workers’ compensation costs 

income taxes 

the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amount and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded net as noncurrent deferred income taxes in addition valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized in making this determination the company considers all available positive and negative evidence including projected future taxable income future reversals of existing temporary differences recent financial operations and tax planning strategies 

the company recognizes a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits

quarterly results of operations 

the following is a summary of the quarterly results of operations for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  





we recorded the quarterly earnings per share amounts as if each quarter was a discrete period as a result the sum of the basic and diluted earnings per share will not necessarily total the annual basic and diluted earnings per share 

the preparation of interim consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the amounts reported in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements specifically the company makes estimates and assumptions in its interim condensed consolidated financial statements for inventory adjustments the accrual of bad debts the accrual of insurance reserves customer sales returns and volume incentives earned among others inventory adjustments including adjustments for a majority of inventories that are valued under the lastin firstout lifo method are accrued on an interim basis and adjusted in the fourth quarter based on the annual book to physical inventory adjustment and lifo valuation which is performed each yearend reserves for bad debts insurance and customer sales returns are estimated and accrued on an interim basis based upon historical experience volume incentives are estimated based upon cumulative and projected purchasing levels income taxes are estimated on an interim basis to reflect the impact of tax reform assumptions and other considerations the estimates and assumptions for interim reporting may change upon final determination at yearend and such changes may be significant the effect of these adjustments in 2018  and 2017  was not significant 




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk    

although the company does not face material risks related to commodity prices the company is exposed to changes in interest rates and in foreign currency rates with respect to foreign currency denominated operating revenues and expenses 

foreign currency 

the company has translation gains or losses that result from translation of the results of operations of an operating unit’s foreign functional currency into us dollars for consolidated financial statement purposes for the periods presented the company’s principal foreign currency exchange exposure is the canadian dollar the functional currency of our canadian operations the australian dollar the functional currency of our australasian operations and to a lesser extent and the mexican peso the functional currency of our mexican operations effective in november 2017 the company increased its foreign currency exchange exposure to include the euro the functional currency of our european operations foreign currency exchange exposure particularly in regard to the canadian and australian dollar and to a lesser extent the euro and mexican peso positively impacted our results for the year ended december 31 2018  

during 2018  and 2017  it was estimated that a 10 shift in exchange rates between those foreign functional currencies and the us dollar would have impacted translated net sales by approximately 486 million and 287 million respectively a 15 shift in exchange rates between those functional currencies and the us dollar would have impacted translated net sales by approximately 729 million in 2018  and 430 million in 2017  a 20 shift in exchange rates between those functional currencies and the us dollar would have impacted translated net sales by approximately 972 million in 2018  and 574 million in 2017  

interest rates 

primarily as a result of the new debt issued in 2017 associated with the purchase of aag the company is subject to interest rate volatility with regard to existing and future issuances of debt we monitor our mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt as well as our mix of shortterm debt and longterm debt from time to time we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations based on the companys variablerate debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of december 31 2018 we estimate that a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by 12 million in 2018 however this increase in interest expense would have been partially offset by the increase in interest income related to higher interest rates

 item 9a  controls and procedures    

management’s conclusion regarding the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures 

as of the end of the period covered by this report an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the company’s management including the chief executive officer ceo and chief financial officer cfo of the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in sec rule 13a15e based on that evaluation the company’s management including the ceo and cfo concluded that due to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting the company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december 31 2018 a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

there were no material errors in the financial results or balances identified as a result of the control deficiencies and there were no restatements of prior period financial statements and no change in previously released financial results were required as the result of these control deficiencies 

notwithstanding the identified material weakness management including our ceo principal executive officer and cfo principal financial officer believes the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k fairly represent in all material respects our financial condition results of operations and cash flows at and for the periods presented in accordance with the united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

the management of genuine parts company and its subsidiaries the “company” is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 

the company’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company’s management and to the board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of the company’s published consolidated financial statements the company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 

i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company

iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

the company’s management including our ceo and cfo assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2018 in making this assessment it used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 2013 framework coso in “internal controlintegrated framework” based on this assessment management concluded that due to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting the company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december 31 2018 

alliance automotive group aag was acquired on november 2 2017 and generated approximately 10 of the company’s total net sales for the year ended december 31 2018 aag is headquartered in london uk and is organized in approximately 220 legal entities across france germany the uk and poland aag’s financial reporting processes rely upon numerous information technology applications the internal control environment is structured in decentralized accounting and reporting locations across europe prior to the company’s november 2017 acquisition aag was not required to file reports with the securities and exchange commission sec aag also was not previously required to prepare consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” in any prior reporting period prior to 2018 aag was not included in the companys assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as the sec rules provide companies one year to assess controls at an acquired entity accordingly within this period we performed our first comprehensive assessment of the design and effectiveness of internal controls at aag and determined that aag’s internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of december 31 2018 

specifically aag did not adequately identify design and maintain internal controls at the transaction level that mitigate the risk of material misstatement in financial reporting processes nor did it maintain appropriate information technology controls financial reporting processes include i the financial statement closing process ii the processing and accounting for revenue purchasing merchandise inventory treasury and payroll transactions and iii the related information technology applications in certain instances proper controls were identified but they did not operate for a sufficient period of time for management to conclude through testing that controls were designed and operating effectively

remediation efforts to address material weakness 

management has and will continue to enhance the risk assessment process and design and implementation of internal control over financial reporting at aag this includes initiation of compensating controls and enhanced and revised design of existing financial reporting controls information technology applications and procedures at aag the material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded through testing that these controls are operating effectively 

changes in internal control over financial reporting

we may not be able to successfully implement our business initiatives in each of our four business segments to grow our sales and earnings which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

index to financial statements 

we have implemented numerous initiatives in each of our four business segments to grow sales and earnings including the introduction of new and expanded product lines strategic acquisitions geographic expansion including through acquisitions sales to new markets enhanced customer marketing programs and a variety of gross margin and cost savings initiatives if we are unable to implement these initiatives efficiently and effectively or if these initiatives are unsuccessful our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

successful implementation of these initiatives also depends on factors specific to the automotive parts industry and the other industries in which we operate and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control in addition to the other risk factors contained in this “item 1a risk factors” adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our business initiatives and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 our business will be adversely affected if demand for our products slows 

our business depends on customer demand for the products that we distribute demand for these products depends on many factors 

with respect to our automotive group the primary factors are 

 with respect to our industrial parts group the primary factors are 



index to financial statements 

 with respect to our business products group the primary factors are 

 with respect to our electricalelectronic materials group the primary factors are 

 changes in legislation or government regulations or policies could have a significant impact on our results of operations 

certain political developments including the results of the presidential election in the us and the decision of the united kingdom to exit the european union have resulted in increased economic uncertainty for multinational companies these developments may result in economic and trade policy actions that could impact economic conditions in many countries and change the landscape of international trade our business is global so changes to existing international trade agreements blocking of foreign trade or imposition of tariffs on foreign goods could result in decreased revenues andor increases in pricing either of which could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows in future periods in addition the tax cuts and jobs act the act was signed into law on december 22 2017 the act which reduces the us corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 requires companies to pay a onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings it resulted in the company writing down our deferred tax assets in 2017 and recording a payable for the estimated transition tax on foreign sourced earnings these amounts were provisional and could be adjusted in 2018 as calculations are finalized and the full effects of the act are reflected on our business and financial results 

uncertainty andor deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions including unemployment inflation or deflation changes in tax policies changes in energy costs uncertain credit markets or other economic conditions could have a negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our business and operating results have been and may in the future be adversely affected by uncertain global economic conditions including domestic outputs employment rates inflation or deflation changes in tax policies instability in credit markets declining consumer and business confidence fluctuating commodity prices interest rates volatile exchange rates and other challenges that could affect the global economy both our commercial and retail customers may experience deterioration of their financial resources which could result in existing or potential customers delaying or canceling plans to purchase our products our vendors could experience similar conditions which could impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us future weakness in the global economy could adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows in future periods 

we face substantial competition in the industries in which we do business 

the sale of automotive and industrial parts business products and electrical materials is highly competitive and impacted by many factors including name recognition product availability customer service changing customer preferences store location and pricing pressures because we seek to offer competitive prices if our competitors reduce their prices we may be 

index to financial statements 

forced to reduce our prices which could result in a material decline in our revenues and earnings increased competition among distributors of automotive and industrial parts office products and electronic materials including increased availability among digital and ecommerce providers across the markets in which we do business could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations the company anticipates no decline in competition in any of its four business segments in the foreseeable future 

in particular the market for replacement automotive parts is highly competitive and subjects us to a wide variety of competitors we compete primarily with national and regional auto parts chains independently owned regional and local automotive parts and accessories stores automobile dealers that supply manufacturer replacement parts and accessories mass merchandisers internet providers and wholesale clubs that sell automotive products and regional and local full service automotive repair shops both new and established 

furthermore both the automotive aftermarket and the office supply industries continue to experience consolidation consolidation among our competitors could further enhance their financial position provide them with the ability to provide more competitive prices to customers for whom we compete and allow them to achieve increased efficiencies in their consolidated operations that enable them to more effectively compete for customers if we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies or if our competitors develop more effective strategies we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

in addition the loss of a major customer in the business products group could significantly impact its results of operations 

we depend on our relationships with our vendors and a disruption of our vendor relationships or a disruption in our vendors’ operations could harm our business 

as a distributor of automotive parts industrial parts business products and electricalelectronic materials our business depends on developing and maintaining close and productive relationships with our vendors we depend on our vendors to sell us quality products at favorable prices many factors outside our control including without limitation raw material shortages inadequate manufacturing capacity labor disputes transportation disruptions tax and legislative uncertainties or weather conditions could adversely affect our vendors’ ability to deliver to us quality merchandise at favorable prices in a timely manner 

 furthermore financial or operational difficulties with a particular vendor could cause that vendor to increase the cost of the products or decrease the quality of the products we purchase from it vendor consolidation could also limit the number of suppliers from which we may purchase products and could materially affect the prices we pay for these products in addition we would suffer an adverse impact if our vendors limit or cancel the return privileges that currently protect us from inventory obsolescence 

we recognize the growing demand for businesstobusiness and businesstocustomer digital and ecommerce options and solutions and we could lose business if we fail to provide the digital and ecommerce options and solutions our customers wish to use 

our success in digital and ecommerce depends on our ability to accurately identify the products to make available through digital and ecommerce platforms across our business segments and to establish and maintain such platforms to provide the highest level of data security to our customers on and through the platforms our customers wish to use including mobile with rapidly changing technology in a highly competitive environment 

if we experience a security breach if our internal information systems fail to function properly or if we are unsuccessful in implementing integrating or upgrading our information systems our business operations could be materially affected 

we depend on information systems to process customer orders manage inventory and accounts receivable collections purchase products manage accounts payable processes ship products to customers on a timely basis maintain cost effective operations provide superior service to customers and accumulate financial results despite our implementation of security measures our it systems are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses natural disasters unauthorized physical or electronic access power outages computer system or network failures cyberattacks and other similar disruptions maintaining and operating these measures requires continuous investments which the company has made and will continue to make a security breach could result in sensitive data being lost manipulated or exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public 

a serious prolonged disruption of our information systems for any of the above reasons could materially impair fundamental business processes and increase expenses decrease sales or otherwise reduce earnings furthermore such a breach may harm our reputation and business prospects and subject us to legal claims if there is loss disclosure or misappropriation of or access to our customers’ information as threats related to cyber security breaches develop and grow we may also find it necessary to make further investments to protect our data and infrastructure 

index to financial statements 

because we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees and other costs 

we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers employees or other third parties for various reasons the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

additionally we are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to taxes environmental protection product quality standards building and zoning requirements as well as employment law matters if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs in addition our capital expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations 

     we are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel could harm our business 

our future success significantly depends on the continued services and performance of our key management personnel we believe our management team’s depth and breadth of experience in our industry is integral to executing our business plan we also will need to continue to attract motivate and retain other key personnel the loss of services of members of our senior management team or other key employees the inability to attract additional qualified personnel as needed or failure to plan for the succession of senior management and key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 

    our increased debt levels could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations 

we have an unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured senior notes which could have important consequences to our financial health for example our level of indebtedness could among other things 

• make it more difficult to satisfy our financial obligations including those relating to the senior unsecured notes and our credit facility 

• increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions 

• limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes and opportunities in our industry which may place us at a competitive disadvantage 

• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows to service the principal and interest on the debt reducing the funds available for other business purposes such as working capital capital expenditures or other cash requirements 

• limit our ability to incur additional debt with acceptable terms and 

• expose us to fluctuations in interest rates 

in addition the terms of our financing obligations include restrictions such as affirmative negative and financial covenants conditions on borrowing and subsidiary guarantees a failure to comply with these restrictions could result in a default under our financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions the occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

nonoperating expenses consist primarily of interest interest expense was 41 million in 2017 21 million in 2016 and 22 million in 2015 the 20 million increase in interest expense in 2017 reflects the combination of higher debt levels throughout the year and rising interest rates on certain variable interest debt instruments in addition the company further increased its debt levels with the acquisition of alliance automotive group on november 2 2017 the 1 million decrease in interest expense in 2016 compared to 2015 reflects the more favorable interest rate on certain debt which was renewed in november 2016 this was partially offset by new longterm debt which commenced in july 2016 

in “other” the net benefit of interest income equity method investment income investment dividends and noncontrolling interests in 2017 was 31 million a 5 million increase from the prior year the increase in other reflects the incremental investment income associated with the companys april 2017 inenco investment as well as higher interest income earned in 2017 relative to 2016 these items totaled 26 million in 2016 an increase from 21 million in 2015 due to higher interest income earned in 2016 relative to 2015 

income before income taxes 

income before income taxes was 10 billion in 2017 down 6 from 2016 as a percentage of net sales income before income taxes was 62 in 2017 compared to 70 in 2016 adjusted for 491 million in transactionrelated costs primarily associated with the companys acquisition of alliance automotive group on november 2 2017 income before income taxes was down 1 from 2016 and 65 of net sales in 2016 income before income taxes was 11 billion down 4 from 2015 and as a percentage of net sales was 70 compared to 74 in 2015 

automotive group 

automotive income before income taxes as a percentage of net sales which we refer to as operating margin decreased to 83 in 2017 from 88 in 2016 the decrease in margin reflects the loss of expense leverage due to 1 growth in comparable sales for automotive as this group requires approximately 3 comparable sales growth to leverage its fixed costs in addition rising costs in several areas negatively impacted automotives margin to improve automotives operating margin this group is focused on several initiatives to grow sales and has also enhanced its cost management initiatives to drive savings in 2018 and the years ahead 

automotive’s operating margin of 88 in 2016 was down from 91 in 2015 due to the loss of expense leverage on weak comparable sales in the us 

index to financial statements 

industrial group 

industrial’s operating margin was 77 in 2017 which is up from 73 in 2016 the improvement in operating margin for this group primarily reflects the positive impact of stronger sales growth in 2017 relative to 2016 driven by an improved industrial economy gross margins benefited from the increase in supplier incentives and rebates and operating expenses were better leveraged industrial enters 2018 in position to further expand their operating margin 

industrial’s operating margin was 73 in 2016 which was unchanged from 2015 the constant margin primarily reflects improved gross margins and cost savings associated with initiatives to consolidate locations during 2016 which were partially offset by continued pressure on operating expenses associated with the decrease in comparable sales for the year 

business products group 

business products operating margin decreased to 49 in 2017 from 59 in 2016 as gross margin pressures associated with lower supplier incentives as well as rising costs and the deleveraging of expenses due to comparable sales declines in this groups core office supplies business continue to weigh on the operating margin for this business the business products group enters 2018 focused on its core growth initiatives the further diversification of its business and the evaluation of options for new and enhanced opportunities that may serve to more effectively navigate the difficult industry dynamics in which we compete 

business products operating margin decreased to 59 in 2016 from 73 in 2015 primarily due to gross margin pressures associated with lower supplier incentives and the deleveraging of expenses due to comparable sales declines in the core office supplies business 

electricalelectronic group 

electricalelectronic’s operating margin was 72 in 2017 a decrease from 85 in 2016 as changes in product mix pressured gross margins and operating expenses were deleveraged due to the slight decline in comparable sales for the year we expect further cost savings in 2018 as this group combines with the industrial parts group 

electricalelectronic’s operating margin decreased to 85 in 2016 from 93 in 2015 primarily due to changes in product mix that pressured gross margins as well as deleveraging of operating expenses due to lower comparable sales from the previous year these items were partially offset by cost savings initiatives to consolidate locations 

income taxes 

the tax cuts and jobs act was enacted december 22 2017 while not all inclusive these are the provisions of the act that materially impact the company it reduces the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 for taxable years starting after december 31 2017 requires companies to pay a onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were not previously subject to us federal income tax and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings 

the effective income tax rate of 389 in 2017 increased from 360 in 2016 the increase in rate reflects the 51 million tax expense related to the transition tax associated with foreign earnings and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities as required by the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 excluding this onetime tax expense our adjusted 2017 income tax rate would have been 338 which reflects a favorable mix of us and foreign earnings including alliance automotive group acquired november 2 2017 

the effective income tax rate of   360  in 2016 decreased from 372 in 2015 the decrease in rate primarily reflects the companys lower mix of us earnings in 2016 which is taxed at a higher rate relative to our foreign operations additionally the more favorable retirement asset valuation adjustment in 2016 relative to 2015 resulted in the decrease in rate 

net income 

net income was 617 million in 2017 a decrease of 103 from 687 million in 2016 on a per share diluted basis net income was 418 in 2017 down 89 compared to 459 in 2016 net income was 38 of net sales in 2017 compared to 45 of net sales in 2016 adjusted net income was 696 million in 2017 up 12 from 2016 and on a per share diluted basis adjusted net income was 471 a 26 increase compared to 459 in in 2016 adjusted net income and adjusted diluted net income per share exclude the impact of transaction related costs primarily related to the companys acquisition of alliance automotive group and the onetime transition tax associated with foreign earnings and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities as required by the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017

a summary of the company’s consolidated statements of cash flows is as follows 



net cash provided by operating activities

net cash provided by operating activities was 946 million in 2016 an 18 decrease from 2015 due primarily to the change in trade accounts receivable merchandise inventories and trade accounts payable which collectively net to a 123 million source of cash in 2016 compared to a 312 million source of cash in 2015 

net cash used in investing activities 

net cash flow used in investing activities was 163 billion in 2017 compared to 594 million in 2016 a 104 billion or 174 increase cash used for acquisitions of businesses and other investing activities in 2017 was 149 billion or 103 billion more than in 2016 primarily this increase reflects the companys purchase of alliance automotive group capital expenditures of 157 million in 2017 compare to 161 million in 2016 and were within the range of our original estimate of 145 to 165 million for the year we estimate that cash used for capital expenditures in 2018 will be approximately 200 to 220 million

net cash provided by used in financing activities 

 net cash provided by financing activities in 2017 totaled 872 million an increase of 119 billion or 370 from the 322 million used in financing activities in 2016 primarily the increase reflects additional borrowings associated with the companys purchase of aag cash used in financing activities in 2016 was down 60 from the 806 million used in 2015 for the three years presented the companys financing activities included the use of cash for dividends paid to shareholders and repurchases of the company’s common stock the company paid dividends to shareholders of 395 million 387 million and 368 million during 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively the company expects this trend of increasing dividends to continue in the foreseeable future during 2017 2016 and 2015 the company repurchased 174 million 181 million and 292 million respectively of the company’s common stock we expect to remain active in our share repurchase program but the amount and value of shares repurchased will vary in 2016 net cash used in financing activities was partially offset by approximately 250 million in net proceeds from debt 

notes and other borrowings 

the company maintains a 26 billion syndicated credit facility with a consortium of financial institutions which matures in june 2022 with an option to decrease the borrowing capacity or terminate the syndicated facility with appropriate notice and bears interest at libor plus a margin which is based on the company’s debt to earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization ebitda ratio 269 at december 31 2017 the company also has the option to increase the borrowing capacity up to an additional 1 billion as well as an option to decrease the borrowing capacity or terminate the facility with appropriate notice at december 31 2017 approximately 17 billion were outstanding under this line of credit due to the workers’ compensation and insurance reserve requirements in certain states the company also had unused letters of credit of approximately 62 million and 65 million outstanding at december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively

contractual and other obligations 

the following table shows the company’s approximate obligations and commitments including interest due on credit facilities to make future payments under specified contractual obligations as of december 31 2017 

contractual obligations 



due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with the company’s unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2017 the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities therefore 17 million of unrecognized tax benefits and the provisional 37 million onetime transition tax estimate related to the act have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above refer to note 7 of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes 

index to financial statements 

purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in our estimates we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements our purchase orders are based on our current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons the company does not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements 

the company guarantees the borrowings of certain independently owned automotive parts stores independents and certain other affiliates in which the company has a noncontrolling equity ownership interest affiliates the company’s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these independents and affiliates is generally equal to the total borrowings subject to the company’s guarantee to date the company has had no significant losses in connection with guarantees of independents’ and affiliates’ borrowings the following table shows the company’s approximate commercial commitments as of december 31 2017 

other commercial commitments 



in addition the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans that may obligate us to make contributions to the plans from time to time contributions in 2017 were 53 million we expect to make 47 million in cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit plans in 2018 and contributions required for 2018 and future years will depend on a number of unpredictable factors including the market performance of the plans’ assets and future changes in interest rates that affect the actuarial measurement of the plans’ obligations 

share repurchases 

in 2017 the company repurchased approximately 19 million shares and the company had remaining authority to purchase approximately 174 million shares at december 31 2017 

critical accounting policies 

general 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we describe in this section certain critical accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates assumptions and judgments an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially impact the consolidated financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for further information on the critical accounting policies see note 1 of the consolidated financial statements 

inventories — provisions for slow moving and obsolescence 

the company identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates appropriate provisions related thereto historically these losses have not been significant as the vast majority of the company’s inventories are not highly susceptible 

index to financial statements 

to obsolescence and are eligible for return under various vendor return programs while the company has no reason to believe its inventory return privileges will be discontinued in the future its risk of loss associated with obsolete or slow moving inventories would increase if such were to occur 

allowance for doubtful accounts — methodology 

the company evaluates the collectability of trade accounts receivable based on a combination of factors the company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on historical bad debt experience and periodically adjusts this estimate when the company becomes aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations eg bankruptcy filing or as a result of changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable while the company has a large customer base that is geographically dispersed a general economic downturn in any of the industry segments in which the company operates could result in higher than expected defaults and therefore the need to revise estimates for bad debts for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 the company recorded provisions for doubtful accounts of approximately 139 million 115 million and 124 million respectively 

consideration received from vendors 

the company may enter into agreements at the beginning of each year with many of its vendors that provide for inventory purchase incentives generally the company earns inventory purchase incentives upon achieving specified volume purchasing levels or other criteria the company accrues for the receipt of these incentives as part of its inventory cost based on cumulative purchases of inventory to date and projected inventory purchases through the end of the year while management believes the company will continue to receive consideration from vendors in 2018 and beyond there can be no assurance that vendors will continue to provide comparable amounts of incentives in the future or that we will be able to achieve the specified volumes necessary to take advantage of such incentives 

impairment of property plant and equipment and goodwill and other intangible assets 

at least annually the company evaluates property plant and equipment goodwill and other intangible assets for potential impairment indicators the company’s judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance among other factors future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired evaluating for impairment also requires the company to estimate future operating results and cash flows which require judgment by management any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

employee benefit plans 

the company’s benefit plan committees in the us and canada establish investment policies and strategies and regularly monitor the performance of the company’s pension plan assets the plans in europe are unfunded and therefore there are no plan assets the pension plan investment strategy implemented by the company’s management is to achieve longterm objectives and invest the pension assets in accordance with the applicable pension legislation in the us and canada as well as fiduciary standards the longterm primary objectives for the pension plan funds are to provide for a reasonable amount of longterm growth of capital without undue exposure to risk protect the assets from erosion of purchasing power and provide investment results that meet or exceed the pension plans’ actuarially assumed long term rates of return the company’s investment strategy with respect to pension plan assets is to generate a return in excess of the passive portfolio benchmark 47 sp 500 index 5 russell mid cap index 7 russell 2000 index 5 msci eafe index 5 dj global moderate index 3 msci emerging market net and 28 barcap us govtcredit 

we make several critical assumptions in determining our pension plan assets and liabilities and related pension income we believe the most critical of these assumptions are the expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate other assumptions we make relate to employee demographic factors such as rate of compensation increases mortality rates retirement patterns and turnover rates refer to note 8 of the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding these assumptions 

based on the investment policy for the pension plans as well as an asset study that was performed based on the company’s asset allocations and future expectations the company’s expected rate of return on plan assets for measuring 2018 pension income is 720 for the plans the asset study forecasted expected rates of return for the approximate duration of the company’s benefit obligations using capital market data and historical relationships 

the discount rate is chosen as the rate at which pension obligations could be effectively settled and is based on capital market conditions as of the measurement date we have matched the timing and duration of the expected cash flows of our pension obligations to a yield curve generated from a broad portfolio of highquality fixed income debt instruments to select our discount rate based upon this cash flow matching analysis we selected a weighted average discount rate for the plans of 370 at december 31 2017 

index to financial statements 

net periodic benefit income for our defined benefit pension plans was 126 million 134 million and 58 million for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively the income associated with the pension plans in 2017 2016 and 2015 reflects the impact of the hard freeze effective december 31 2013 refer to note 8 of the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding employee benefit plans 

business combinations 

from time to time the company may enter into business combinations the company generally recognizes the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree at their fair values as of the date of acquisition the company measures goodwill as the excess of consideration transferred which the company also measures at fair value over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed the acquisition method of accounting requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition including the fair values of identifiable intangible assets deferred tax asset valuation allowances liabilities including those related to debt pensions and other postretirement plans uncertain tax positions contingent consideration and contingencies this method also requires the company to refine these estimates over a measurement period not to exceed one year to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that if known would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date if the company is required to adjust provisional amounts that it has recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions these adjustments could have a material impact on the its financial condition and results of operations 

significant estimates and assumptions in estimating the fair value of acquired customer relationships and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that the company expects to generate from the acquired assets if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values the company could record impairment charges in addition the company has estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense if the companys estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could be increased or decreased or the acquired asset could be impaired 

quarterly results of operations 

the following is a summary of the quarterly results of operations for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 



we recorded the quarterly earnings per share amounts as if each quarter was a discrete period as a result the sum of the basic and diluted earnings per share will not necessarily total the annual basic and diluted earnings per share 

the preparation of interim consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the amounts reported in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements specifically the company makes estimates 

index to financial statements 

and assumptions in its interim condensed consolidated financial statements for inventory adjustments the accrual of bad debts the accrual of insurance reserves customer sales returns and volume incentives earned among others inventory adjustments including adjustments for a majority of inventories that are valued under the lastin firstout lifo method are accrued on an interim basis and adjusted in the fourth quarter based on the annual book to physical inventory adjustment and lifo valuation which is performed each yearend reserves for bad debts insurance and customer sales returns are estimated and accrued on an interim basis based upon historical experience volume incentives are estimated based upon cumulative and projected purchasing levels income taxes are estimated on an interim basis to reflect the impact of tax reform assumptions and other considerations the estimates and assumptions for interim reporting may change upon final determination at yearend and such changes may be significant the effect of these adjustments in 2017 and 2016 was not significant 




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk    

although the company does not face material risks related to interest rates and commodity prices the company is exposed to changes in foreign currency rates with respect to foreign currency denominated operating revenues and expenses 

foreign currency 

the company has translation gains or losses that result from translation of the results of operations of an operating unit’s foreign functional currency into us dollars for consolidated financial statement purposes for the periods presented the company’s principal foreign currency exchange exposure is the canadian dollar the functional currency of our canadian operations the australian dollar the functional currency of our australasian operations and to a lesser extent the mexican peso the functional currency of our mexican operations effective in november 2017 the company increased its foreign currency exchange exposure to include the euro the functional currency of our european operations foreign currency exchange exposure particularly in regard to the canadian and australian dollar and to a lesser extent the euro and mexican peso positively impacted our results for the year ended december 31 2017 

during 2017 and 2016 it was estimated that a 10 shift in exchange rates between those foreign functional currencies and the us dollar would have impacted translated net sales by approximately 287 million and 262 million respectively a 15 shift in exchange rates between those functional currencies and the us dollar would have impacted translated net sales by approximately 430 million in 2017 and 393 million in 2016 a 20 shift in exchange rates between those functional currencies and the us dollar would have impacted translated net sales by approximately 574 million in 2017 and 524 million in 2016

certain political developments occurring this past year including the results of the presidential election in the us and the decision of the united kingdom to exit the european union have resulted in increased economic uncertainty for multinational companies these developments may result in economic and trade policy actions that could impact economic conditions in many countries and change the landscape of international trade our business is global so changes to existing international trade agreements blocking of foreign trade or imposition of tariffs on foreign goods could result in decreased revenues andor increases in pricing either of which could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows in future periods 

uncertainty andor deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions including unemployment inflation or deflation changes in tax policies changes in energy costs uncertain credit markets or other economic conditions could have a negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our business and operating results have been and may in the future be adversely affected by uncertain global economic conditions including domestic outputs employment rates inflation or deflation changes in tax policies instability in credit markets declining consumer and business confidence fluctuating commodity prices interest rates volatile exchange rates and other challenges that could affect the global economy both our commercial and retail customers may experience deterioration of their financial resources which could result in existing or potential customers delaying or canceling plans to purchase our products our vendors could experience similar conditions which could impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us future weakness in the global economy could adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows in future periods 

we face substantial competition in the industries in which we do business 

the sale of automotive and industrial parts office products and electrical materials is highly competitive and impacted by many factors including name recognition product availability customer service changing customer preferences store location and pricing pressures because we seek to offer competitive prices if our competitors reduce their prices we may be forced to reduce our prices which could result in a material decline in our revenues and earnings increased competition among distributors of automotive and industrial parts office products and electronic materials including increased availability among digital and ecommerce providers across the markets in which we do business could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations the company anticipates no decline in competition in any of its four business segments in the foreseeable future 

in particular the market for replacement automotive parts is highly competitive and subjects us to a wide variety of competitors we compete primarily with national and regional auto parts chains independently owned regional and local automotive parts and accessories stores automobile dealers that supply manufacturer replacement parts and accessories mass merchandisers internet providers and wholesale clubs that sell automotive products and regional and local full service automotive repair shops both new and established 

furthermore both the automotive aftermarket and the office supply industry continue to experience consolidation consolidation among our competitors could further enhance their financial position provide them with the ability to provide more competitive prices to customers for whom we compete and allow them to achieve increased efficiencies in their consolidated operations that enable them to more effectively compete for customers if we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies or if our competitors develop more effective strategies we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

in addition the loss of a major customer in the office products group could significantly impact its results of operations 

we depend on our relationships with our vendors and a disruption of our vendor relationships or a disruption in our vendors’ operations could harm our business 

as a distributor of automotive parts industrial parts office products and electricalelectronic materials our business depends on developing and maintaining close and productive relationships with our vendors we depend on our vendors to sell us quality products at favorable prices many factors outside our control including without limitation raw material shortages inadequate manufacturing capacity labor disputes transportation disruptions tax and legislative uncertainies or weather conditions could adversely affect our vendors’ ability to deliver to us quality merchandise at favorable prices in a timely manner 

 furthermore financial or operational difficulties with a particular vendor could cause that vendor to increase the cost of the products or decrease the quality of the products we purchase from it vendor consolidation could also limit the number of suppliers from which we may purchase products and could materially affect the prices we pay for these products in addition 

index to financial statements 

we would suffer an adverse impact if our vendors limit or cancel the return privileges that currently protect us from inventory obsolescence 

we recognize the growing demand for businesstobusiness and businesstocustomer digital and ecommerce options and solutions and we could lose business if we fail to provide the digital and ecommerce options and solutions our customers wish to use 

our success in digital and ecommerce depends on our ability to accurately identify the products to make available through digital and ecommerce platforms across our business segments and to establish and maintain such platforms to provide the highest level of data security to our customers on and through the platforms our customers wish to use including mobile with rapidly changing technology in a highly competitive environment 

if we experience a security breach if our internal information systems fail to function properly or if we are unsuccessful in implementing integrating or upgrading our information systems our business operations could be materially affected 

we depend on information systems to process customer orders manage inventory and accounts receivable collections purchase products manage accounts payable processes ship products to customers on a timely basis maintain cost effective operations provide superior service to customers and accumulate financial results despite our implementation of security measures our it systems are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses natural disasters unauthorized physical or electronic access power outages computer system or network failures cyberattacks and other similar disruptions maintaining and operating these measures requires continuous investments which the company has made and will continue to make a security breach could result in sensitive data being lost manipulated or exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public 

a serious prolonged disruption of our information systems for any of the above reasons could materially impair fundamental business processes and increase expenses decrease sales or otherwise reduce earnings furthermore such a breach may harm our reputation and business prospects and subject us to legal claims if there is loss disclosure or misappropriation of or access to our customers’ information as threats related to cyber security breaches develop and grow we may also find it necessary to make further investments to protect our data and infrastructure 

because we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees and other costs 

we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers employees or other third parties for various reasons the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

additionally we are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to taxes environmental protection product quality standards building and zoning requirements as well as employment law matters if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs in addition our capital expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations 

we are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel could harm our business 

our future success significantly depends on the continued services and performance of our key management personnel we believe our management team’s depth and breadth of experience in our industry is integral to executing our business plan we also will need to continue to attract motivate and retain other key personnel the loss of services of members of our senior management team or other key employees the inability to attract additional qualified personnel as needed or failure to plan for the succession of senior management and key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business

index to financial statements 

we recorded consolidated net sales of 153 billion for the year ended december 31 2016 an increase of 04 compared to sales in 2015 consolidated net income for the year ended december 31 2016 was 687 million down 3 from 706 million in 2015 the company’s growth strategy and in particular the initiatives to expand our global footprint via strategic acquisitions served to offset the challenging sales environment that persisted in our us markets during 2016 we were also focused on ongoing measures to improve gross margins and control costs although the loss of leverage due to weak comparable sales trends increased our expenses as a percentage of sales and negatively impacted earnings growth 

the relatively unchanged sales results for 2016 and 2015 compare to a 9 sales increase in 2014 net income in 2015 was down by 1 and increased by 4 in 2014 our revenue and earnings in 2015 reflect a 3 negative impact of currency translation and after adjusting for this factor the company produced an increase in both sales and net income for that year in 2014 improved market conditions relative to the prior year drove sales and earnings growth in each of our four business segments over the three year period of 2014 through 2016 our financial performance reflects a variety of initiatives the company implemented to grow sales and earnings across our businesses examples of such initiatives include strategic acquisitions the introduction of new and expanded product lines geographic expansion sales to new markets enhanced customer marketing programs and a variety of gross margin and cost savings initiatives we discuss these initiatives further below 

with regard to the december 31 2016 consolidated balance sheet the company’s cash balance of 243 million compares to cash of 212 million at december 31 2015 the company continues to maintain a strong cash position supported by relatively steady net income and effective asset management accounts receivable increased by approximately 6 which compares to an approximate 3 sales increase in the fourth quarter of the year and inventory was up by approximately 7 including the impact of acquisitions accounts payable increased 260 million or 9 from the prior year due primarily to improved payment terms with certain suppliers total debt outstanding at december 31 2016 was 875 million an increase from total debt of 625 million at december 31 2015 

results of operations 

our results of operations are summarized below for the three years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 



net sales 

consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31 2016 totaled 153 billion up slightly from 2015 2016 net sales included a 24 contribution from acquisitions net of store closures offset by a 11 decrease in sales volume and an approximate 05 negative impact of currency translation additionally the company experienced overall product deflation of approximately 03 the impact of product inflationdeflation varied by business in 2016 as prices were down 07 in the automotive segment up approximately 04 in the industrial segment up approximately 03 in the office segment and down approximately 12 in the electricalelectronic segment the company with its global growth initiatives and measures to control rising costs and manage assets is well positioned for sustainable longterm growth 

consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31 2015 totaled 153 billion down slightly from 2014 2015 net sales included a 15 increase in sales volume and a 1 contribution from acquisitions offset by an approximate 3 negative impact of currency translation the impact of product inflationdeflation varied by business in 2015 and cumulatively prices were down 02 in the automotive segment up approximately 09 in the industrial segment up approximately 06 in the office segment and down approximately 17 in the electricalelectronic segment 

automotive group 

net sales for the automotive group “automotive” were 81 billion in 2016 a 1 increase from 2015 the increase in sales for the year consists of an approximate 1 comparable sales increase and a 1 contribution from acquisitions less an approximate 1 negative impact of currency translation associated with our automotive businesses in canada australasia and mexico automotive sales were negatively impacted by product deflation of 07 which is included in the comparable sales increase in 2016 total automotive revenues were up 2 in the first quarter down 1 in the second quarter up 15 in the third quarter and up 2 in the fourth quarter the underlying fundamentals in the automotive aftermarket including the overall number and age of the vehicle population as well as the positive increase in miles driven remain supportive of sustained 

index to financial statements 

demand for automotive aftermarket maintenance and supply items we expect these fundamentals as well as key sales initiatives to drive sales growth for the automotive business in 2017 

net sales for the automotive group were 80 billion in 2015 a 1 decrease from 2014 the decrease in sales for the year consists of a positive core sales increase of approximately 35 and a slight benefit from acquisitions combined the approximate 4 growth was offset by a 5 negative impact of currency associated with our automotive businesses in canada australasia and mexico automotive sales were not materially impacted by product inflation in 2015 automotive revenues were flat in the first and second quarters and down 2 in the third and fourth quarters 

industrial group 

net sales for motion industries our industrial group “industrial” were 46 billion in 2016 basically unchanged from 2015 an approximate 26 decrease in sales volumes and a slight negative impact of currency translation associated with our canadian and mexican operations were partially offset by higher transaction values associated with 04 product inflation and approximately 2 in sales from acquisitions industrial revenues were down 25 in the first quarter of 2016 down 2 in the second quarter and down 1 in the third quarter these quarterly declines were followed by a 4 sales increase in the fourth quarter the sequential improvement in this groups sales performance correlates to the growing strength in the industrial economy as evidenced by economic indicators such as manufacturing industrial production and the purchasing managers index in addition the energy sector which had contracted throughout 2015 and the first half of 2016 began to stabilize over the last half of 2016 looking ahead to 2017 we believe the industrial business is well positioned for profitable growth 

net sales for industrial were 46 billion in 2015 a 3 decrease from 2014 sales volumes in industrial were down approximately 4 from the prior year while a 1 negative impact of currency associated with our canadian and mexican operations also contributed to the decline in sales these items were partially offset by higher transaction values associated with product inflation which added an approximate 1 to sales and 1 in sales from acquisitions industrial revenues were up 3 in the first quarter of 2015 down 2 in the second quarter down 4 in the third quarter and down 75 in the fourth quarter the manufacturing indices we track in this group progressively weakened throughout 2015 which correlates to lower demand among our customer base and in particular those customers dependent on exports as well as the oil and gas sector 

office group 

net sales for s p richards our office products group “office” were 20 billion in 2016 an increase of 2 from 2015 the increase in sales reflects an approximate 7 contribution from acquisitions and a 03 increase in higher transaction values associated with price inflation these items were offset by an approximate 6 decrease in sales volume sales were down 3 in the first quarter up 1 in the second quarter up 5 in the third quarter and up 4 in the fourth quarter of 2016 overall this growth was driven by our strategy to further diversify the office business in the large and growing facilities breakroom and safety supplies fbs category we expect this diversification strategy and the execution of our core sales initiatives to drive this groups growth in 2017 

net sales for office were 19 billion in 2015 an increase of 75 from 2014 the increase in sales reflects an approximate 4 increase in sales volume a 06 increase in higher transaction values associated with price inflation and a 3 contribution from acquisitions these items were offset by an approximate 05 negative impact of currency associated with our canadian operations in 2015 office experienced relatively stable industry conditions as evidenced by the steady growth in new jobs throughout the year these conditions combined with new business from a primary customer which anniversaried on july 1 2015 served to drive the increase in sales volume for the year sales were up 17 in the first quarter up 14 in the second quarter up 3 in the third quarter and down 2 in the fourth quarter of 2015 

electricalelectronic group 

net sales for eis our electrical and electronic group “electricalelectronic” were 716 million in 2016 a decrease of 5 from 2015 the decrease in sales consists of an approximate 4 decline in sales volume a 12 decrease from lower transaction values associated with price deflation and a 05 negative sales impact of copper pricing these items were partially offset by an approximate 1 contribution from acquisitions sales for electricalelectronic decreased by 3 in the first quarter 5 in the second quarter 9 in the third quarter and were unchanged in the fourth quarter relative to the prior year periods the manufacturing segment of the economy was relatively weak in 2016 which pressured demand across the markets served by this business as discussed earlier however these conditions improved in the fourth quarter of the year and we expect further improvement in 2017 which bodes well for the future growth at eis 

net sales for the electricalelectronic business were 751 million in 2015 an increase of 15 from 2014 the increase in sales consists of a 5 contribution from acquisitions offset by a 17 headwind from lower transaction values associated with price deflation a 1 negative sales impact of copper pricing and a 1 decrease in sales volume sales for electricalelectronic increased by 1 in the first quarter 4 in the second quarter 2 in the third quarter and were unchanged in the fourth quarter relative to the prior year periods

in 2016 2015 and 2014 the industrial and office business segments experienced slight vendor price increases in 2014 the electricalelectronic business also experienced a slight vendor price increase in any year where we experience price increases we are able to work with our customers to pass most of these along to them 

operating expenses 

the company includes in selling administrative and other expenses “sga” all personnel and personnelrelated costs at its headquarters distribution centers stores and branches which accounts for approximately 65 of total sga additional costs in sga include our facilities delivery marketing advertising technology legal and professional costs 

sga of 337 billion in 2016 increased by 93 million or approximately 3 from 2015 this represents 220 of net sales compared to 214 of net sales in 2015 the increase in sga expenses from the prior year reflect the year one costs associated with our 19 acquisitions as well as the impact of higher cost and higher gross margin models at select acquisitions the increase in sga expenses as a percentage of net sales from the prior year reflect the loss of leverage due to negative comparable sales in our us automotive industrial office and electricalelectronic businesses to offset these increases we implemented enhanced cost control measures and are intensely focused on assessing the optimal cost structure in our businesses depreciation and amortization expense was 147 million in 2016 an increase of approximately 6 million or 4 from 2015 the provision for doubtful accounts was 12 million in 2016 a decrease of 1 million from 2015 we believe the company is adequately reserved for bad debts at december 31 2016

nonoperating expenses and income 

nonoperating expenses consist primarily of interest interest expense was 21 million in 2016 22 million in 2015 and 25 million in 2014 the 1 million decrease in interest expense in 2016 reflects the more favorable interest rate on certain debt which was renewed in november 2016 this was partially offset by new longterm debt which commenced in july 2016 the 3 million decrease in interest expense in 2015 reflects the impact of lower outstanding debt levels during the year relative to 2014 

in “other” the net benefit of interest income equity method investment income investment dividends and noncontrolling interests in 2016 was 26 million a 5 million increase from the prior year due to higher interest income earned in 2016 relative to 2015 these items were 21 million in 2015 an increase from 19 million in 2014 the 2 million increase from the prior year was due to higher interest income earned in 2015 relative to 2014 

income before income taxes 

income before income taxes was 11 billion in 2016 down 4 from 2015 as a percentage of net sales income before income taxes was 70 in 2016 compared to 74 in 2015 in 2015 income before income taxes of 11 billion was up slightly from 2014 and as a percentage of net sales was 74 compared to 73 in 2014 

automotive group 

automotive income before income taxes as a percentage of net sales which we refer to as operating margin decreased to 88 in 2016 from 91 in 2015 this groups loss of expense leverage due to weak comparable sales in the us was the primary factor in automotives decline in operating profit during the year looking forward planned initiatives to grow sales 

index to financial statements 

including store footprint expansion expand gross margins and control costs are intended to improve its operating margin in the years ahead 

automotive’s operating margin of 91 in 2015 was up from 87 in 2014 the change in gross margin and operating costs as a percentage of net sales positively impacted operating profit during the year 

industrial group 

industrial’s operating margin was 73 in 2016 which is unchanged from 2015 the steady operating margin for this group primarily reflects improved gross margins and cost savings associated with initiatives to consolidate locations during 2016 these savings were partially offset by continued pressure on operating expenses associated with the decrease in comparable sales for the year industrial implemented multiple initiatives to overcome the challenging sales environment and is well positioned to improve their operating margin in 2017 

industrial’s operating margin decreased to 73 in 2015 from 78 in 2014 as the decline in sales for the year resulted in lower volume incentives which pressured gross margins and reduced expense leverage relative to the prior year 

office group 

office’s operating margin decreased to 59 in 2016 from 73 in 2015 primarily due to gross margin pressures associated with lower supplier incentives and the deleveraging of expenses due to comparable sales declines in this groups core office supplies business office enters 2017 intensely focused on its initiatives to further diversify its business and drive sales growth while also driving cost savings 

office’s operating margin decreased slightly to 73 in 2015 from 74 in 2014 primarily related to the deleveraging of expenses due to slower sales growth in the last half of 2015 

electricalelectronic group 

electricalelectronic’s operating margin decreased to 85 in 2016 from 93 in 2015 as changes in product mix pressured gross margins and operating expenses were deleveraged due to the comparable sales decrease for the year these items were partially offset by cost savings initiatives to consolidate locations during 2016 electricalelectronic will continue to focus on its sales initiatives and cost controls to further improve its operating margin in 2017 

electricalelectronic’s operating margin increased to 93 in 2015 from 88 in 2014 primarily due to the positive impact of higher margin acquisitions declining copper prices and effective cost management 

income taxes 

the effective income tax rate of 360 in 2016 decreased from 372 in 2015 the decrease in rate primarily reflects the companys lower mix of us earnings in 2016 which is taxed at a higher rate relative to our foreign operations additionally the more favorable retirement asset valuation adjustment in 2016 relative to 2015 resulted in the decrease in rate 

the effective income tax rate of 372 in 2015 increased from 364 in 2014 the increase in rate primarily reflects the companys higher mix of us earnings in 2015 which is taxed at a higher rate relative to our foreign operations to a lesser extent the less favorable retirement asset valuation adjustment in 2015 relative to 2014 impacted the increase in rate 

net income 

net income was 687 million in 2016 a decrease of 3 from 706 million in 2015 on a per share diluted basis net income was 459 in 2016 down 1 compared to 463 in 2015 net income was 45 of net sales in 2016 compared to 46 of net sales in 2015

index to financial statements 

approximately 7 from december 31 2015 primarily due to acquisitions and accounts payable increased 260 million or approximately 9 from december 31 2015 due primarily to improved payment terms with certain suppliers

notes and other borrowings 

the company maintains a 12 billion unsecured revolving line of credit with a consortium of financial institutions which matures in june 2021 with an optional one year extension and bears interest at libor plus a margin which is based on the company’s leverage ratio 152 at december 31 2016 the company also has the option under this agreement to increase its borrowing an additional 350 million as well as an option to decrease the borrowing capacity or terminate the facility with appropriate notice at december 31 2016 and 2015 approximately 325 million and 125 million were outstanding under this line of credit respectively due to the workers’ compensation and insurance reserve requirements in certain states the company also had unused letters of credit of approximately 65 million and 63 million outstanding at december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively

contractual and other obligations 

the following table shows the company’s approximate obligations and commitments including interest due on credit facilities to make future payments under specified contractual obligations as of december 31 2016 

contractual obligations 



due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with the company’s unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2016 the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities therefore 17 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above refer to note 6 of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes 

purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in our estimates we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements our purchase orders are based on our current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons the company does not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements 

the company guarantees the borrowings of certain independently owned automotive parts stores independents and certain other affiliates in which the company has a noncontrolling equity ownership interest affiliates the company’s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these independents and affiliates is generally equal to the total borrowings subject to the company’s guarantee to date the company has had no significant losses in connection with guarantees of independents’ and affiliates’ borrowings the following table shows the company’s approximate commercial commitments as of december 31 2016

other commercial commitments 



in addition the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans that may obligate us to make contributions to the plans from time to time contributions in 2016 were 54 million we expect to make 48 million in cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit plans in 2017 and contributions required for 2017 and future years will depend on a number of unpredictable factors including the market performance of the plans’ assets and future changes in interest rates that affect the actuarial measurement of the plans’ obligations 

share repurchases 

in 2016 the company repurchased approximately 20 million shares and the company had remaining authority to purchase approximately 43 million shares at december 31 2016 

critical accounting policies 

general 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we describe in this section certain critical accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates assumptions and judgments an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially impact the consolidated financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for further information on the critical accounting policies see note 1 of the consolidated financial statements 

inventories — provisions for slow moving and obsolescence 

the company identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates appropriate provisions related thereto historically these losses have not been significant as the vast majority of the company’s inventories are not highly susceptible to obsolescence and are eligible for return under various vendor return programs while the company has no reason to believe its inventory return privileges will be discontinued in the future its risk of loss associated with obsolete or slow moving inventories would increase if such were to occur 

allowance for doubtful accounts — methodology 

the company evaluates the collectability of trade accounts receivable based on a combination of factors the company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on historical bad debt experience and periodically adjusts this estimate when the company becomes aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations eg bankruptcy filing or as a result of changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable while the company has a large customer base that is geographically dispersed a general economic downturn in any of the industry segments in which the company operates could result in higher than expected defaults and therefore the need to revise estimates for bad debts for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 the company recorded provisions for doubtful accounts of approximately 115 million 124 million and 72 million respectively 

index to financial statements 

consideration received from vendors 

the company enters into agreements at the beginning of each year with many of its vendors that provide for inventory purchase incentives generally the company earns inventory purchase incentives upon achieving specified volume purchasing levels or other criteria the company accrues for the receipt of these incentives as part of its inventory cost based on cumulative purchases of inventory to date and projected inventory purchases through the end of the year while management believes the company will continue to receive consideration from vendors in 2017 and beyond there can be no assurance that vendors will continue to provide comparable amounts of incentives in the future or that we will be able to achieve the specified volumes necessary to take advantage of such incentives 

impairment of property plant and equipment and goodwill and other intangible assets 

at least annually the company evaluates property plant and equipment goodwill and other intangible assets for potential impairment indicators the company’s judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance among other factors future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired evaluating for impairment also requires the company to estimate future operating results and cash flows which require judgment by management any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

employee benefit plans 

the company’s benefit plan committees in the us and canada establish investment policies and strategies and regularly monitor the performance of the company’s pension plan assets the pension plan investment strategy implemented by the company’s management is to achieve longterm objectives and invest the pension assets in accordance with the applicable pension legislation in the us and canada as well as fiduciary standards the longterm primary objectives for the pension plan funds are to provide for a reasonable amount of longterm growth of capital without undue exposure to risk protect the assets from erosion of purchasing power and provide investment results that meet or exceed the pension plans’ actuarially assumed long term rates of return the company’s investment strategy with respect to pension plan assets is to generate a return in excess of the passive portfolio benchmark 47 sp 500 index 5 russell mid cap index 7 russell 2000 index 5 msci eafe index 5 dj global moderate index 3 msci emerging market net and 28 barcap us govtcredit 

we make several critical assumptions in determining our pension plan assets and liabilities and related pension income we believe the most critical of these assumptions are the expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate other assumptions we make relate to employee demographic factors such as rate of compensation increases mortality rates retirement patterns and turnover rates refer to note 7 of the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding these assumptions 

based on the investment policy for the pension plans as well as an asset study that was performed based on the company’s asset allocations and future expectations the company’s expected rate of return on plan assets for measuring 2017 pension income is 782 for the plans the asset study forecasted expected rates of return for the approximate duration of the company’s benefit obligations using capital market data and historical relationships 

the discount rate is chosen as the rate at which pension obligations could be effectively settled and is based on capital market conditions as of the measurement date we have matched the timing and duration of the expected cash flows of our pension obligations to a yield curve generated from a broad portfolio of highquality fixed income debt instruments to select our discount rate based upon this cash flow matching analysis we selected a weighted average discount rate for the plans of 426 at december 31 2016 

net periodic benefit income for our defined benefit pension plans was 134 million 58 million and 96 million for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively the income associated with the pension plans in 2016 2015 and 2014 reflects the impact of the hard freeze effective december 31 2013 refer to note 7 of the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding employee benefit plans

quarterly results of operations 

the following is a summary of the quarterly results of operations for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 



we recorded the quarterly earnings per share amounts as if each quarter was a discrete period as a result the sum of the basic and diluted earnings per share will not necessarily total the annual basic and diluted earnings per share 

the preparation of interim consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the amounts reported in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements specifically the company makes estimates and assumptions in its interim condensed consolidated financial statements for inventory adjustments the accrual of bad debts the accrual of insurance reserves customer sales returns and volume incentives earned among others inventory adjustments including adjustments for a majority of inventories that are valued under the lastin firstout lifo method are accrued on an interim basis and adjusted in the fourth quarter based on the annual book to physical inventory adjustment and lifo valuation which is performed each yearend reserves for bad debts insurance and customer sales returns are estimated and accrued on an interim basis based upon historical experience volume incentives are estimated based upon cumulative and projected purchasing levels the estimates and assumptions for interim reporting may change upon final determination at yearend and such changes may be significant the effect of these adjustments in 2016 and 2015 was not significant 




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk    

although the company does not face material risks related to interest rates and commodity prices the company is exposed to changes in foreign currency rates with respect to foreign currency denominated operating revenues and expenses 

foreign currency 

the company has translation gains or losses that result from translation of the results of operations of an operating unit’s foreign functional currency into us dollars for consolidated financial statement purposes the company’s principal foreign currency exchange exposure is the canadian dollar the functional currency of our canadian operations the australian dollar the functional currency of our australasian operations and to a lesser extent the mexican peso the functional currency of our mexican operations foreign currency exchange exposure particularly in regard to the canadian and australian dollar and to a lesser extent the mexican peso negatively impacted our results for the year ended december 31 2016 

during 2016 and 2015 it was estimated that a 10 shift in exchange rates between those foreign functional currencies and the us dollar would have impacted translated net sales by approximately 262 million and 252 million respectively a 15 shift in exchange rates between those functional currencies and the us dollar would have impacted translated net sales by approximately 393 million in 2016 and 378 million in 2015 a 20 shift in exchange rates between those functional currencies and the us dollar would have impacted translated net sales by approximately 524 million in 2016 and 504 million in 2015

some statements in this report as well as in other materials we file with the sec or otherwise release to the public and in materials that we make available on our website constitute forwardlooking statements that are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 senior officers may also make verbal statements to analysts investors the media and others that are forwardlooking forwardlooking statements may relate for example to future operations prospects strategies financial condition economic performance including growth and earnings industry conditions and demand for our products and services the company cautions that its forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties and while we believe that our expectations for the future are reasonable in view of currently available information you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on our forwardlooking statements actual results or events may differ materially from those indicated in our forwardlooking statements as a result of various important factors such factors include but are not limited to those discussed below 

forwardlooking statements are only as of the date they are made and the company undertakes no duty to update its forwardlooking statements except as required by law you are advised however to review any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our subsequent forms 10q 8k and other reports to the sec 

set forth below are the material risks and uncertainties that if they were to occur could materially and adversely affect our business or could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements in this report and in the other public statements we make please be aware that these risks may change over time and other risks may prove to be important in the future new risks may emerge 

  

at any time and we cannot predict such risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our business financial condition results of operations or the trading price of our securities 

we may not be able to successfully implement our business initiatives in each of our four business segments to grow our sales and earnings which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have implemented numerous initiatives in each of our four business segments to grow sales and earnings including the introduction of new and expanded product lines strategic acquisitions geographic expansion including through acquisitions sales to new markets enhanced customer marketing programs and a variety of gross margin and cost savings initiatives if we are unable to implement these initiatives efficiently and effectively or if these initiatives are unsuccessful our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

successful implementation of these initiatives also depends on factors specific to the automotive parts industry and the other industries in which we operate and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control in addition to the other risk factors contained in this “item 1a risk factors” adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our business initiatives and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our business will be adversely affected if demand for our products slows 

our business depends on customer demand for the products that we distribute demand for these products depends on many factors 

with respect to our automotive group the primary factors are 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

 with respect to our industrial parts group the primary factors are 

 

  

  

  

 with respect to our office products group the primary factors are 

 

  

  

  

 with respect to our electricalelectronic materials group the primary factors are 

 

  

 uncertainty andor deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions including unemployment inflation or deflation changes in energy costs uncertain credit markets or other economic conditions could have a negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our business and operating results have been and may in the future be adversely affected by uncertain global economic conditions including domestic outputs employment rates inflation or deflation instability in credit markets declining consumer and business confidence fluctuating commodity prices interest rates volatile exchange rates and other challenges that could affect the global economy both our commercial and retail customers may experience deterioration of their financial resources which could result in existing or potential customers delaying or canceling plans to purchase our products our vendors could experience similar conditions which could impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us future weakness in the global economy could adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows in future periods 

we face substantial competition in the industries in which we do business 

the sale of automotive and industrial parts office products and electrical materials is highly competitive and impacted by many factors including name recognition product availability customer service changing customer preferences store location and pricing pressures because we seek to offer competitive prices if our 

  

competitors reduce their prices we may be forced to reduce our prices which could result in a material decline in our revenues and earnings increased competition among distributors of automotive and industrial parts office products and electronic materials including internetrelated initiatives could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations the company anticipates no decline in competition in any of its four business segments in the foreseeable future 

in particular the market for replacement automotive parts is highly competitive and subjects us to a wide variety of competitors we compete primarily with national and regional auto parts chains independently owned regional and local automotive parts and accessories stores automobile dealers that supply manufacturer replacement parts and accessories mass merchandisers and wholesale clubs that sell automotive products and regional and local full service automotive repair shops both new and established 

furthermore both the automotive aftermarket and the office supply industry continue to experience consolidation consolidation among our competitors could further enhance their financial position provide them with the ability to provide more competitive prices to customers for whom we compete and allow them to achieve increased efficiencies in their consolidated operations that enable them to more effectively compete for customers if we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies or if our competitors develop more effective strategies we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

we depend on our relationships with our vendors and a disruption of our vendor relationships or a disruption in our vendors’ operations could harm our business 

as a distributor of automotive parts industrial parts office products and electricalelectronic materials our business depends on developing and maintaining close and productive relationships with our vendors we depend on our vendors to sell us quality products at favorable prices many factors outside our control including without limitation raw material shortages inadequate manufacturing capacity labor disputes transportation disruptions or weather conditions could adversely affect our vendors’ ability to deliver to us quality merchandise at favorable prices in a timely manner 

furthermore financial or operational difficulties with a particular vendor could cause that vendor to increase the cost of the products or decrease the quality of the products we purchase from it vendor consolidation could also limit the number of suppliers from which we may purchase products and could materially affect the prices we pay for these products in our automotive business the number of vendors could decrease considerably and the prices charged to us by the remaining vendors could increase to the extent that vehicle production slows due to a decline in consumer spending or other economic factor in addition we would suffer an adverse impact if our vendors limit or cancel the return privileges that currently protect us from inventory obsolescence 

if we experience a security breach if our internal information systems fail to function properly or if we are unsuccessful in implementing integrating or upgrading our information systems our business operations could be materially affected 

we depend on information systems to process customer orders manage inventory and accounts receivable collections purchase products manage accounts payable processes ship products to customers on a timely basis maintain cost effective operations provide superior service to customers and accumulate financial results despite our implementation of security measures our it systems are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses natural disasters unauthorized physical or electronic access power outages computer system or network failures cyberattacks and other similar disruptions maintaining and operating these measures requires continuous investments which the company has made and will continue to make a security breach could result in sensitive data being lost manipulated or exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public 

a serious prolonged disruption of our information systems for any of the above reasons could materially impair fundamental business processes and increase expenses decrease sales or otherwise reduce earnings furthermore such a breach may harm our reputation and business prospects and subject us to legal claims if there is 

  

loss disclosure or misappropriation of or access to our customers’ information as threats related to cyber security breaches develop and grow we may also find it necessary to make further investments to protect our data and infrastructure 

because we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees and other costs 

we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers employees or other third parties for various actions the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

additionally we are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to taxes environmental protection product quality standards building and zoning requirements as well as employment law matters if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs in addition our capital expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations 

we recognize the growing demand for businesstobusiness and businesstocustomer ecommerce options and we could lose business if we fail to provide the ecommerce options our customers wish to use 

our success in ecommerce depends on our ability to accurately identify the products to make available through ecommerce platforms across our business segments and to establish and maintain such platforms to provide the highest level of data security to our customers on and through the platforms our customers wish to use including mobile with rapidly changing technology in a highly competitive environment 

we are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel could harm our business 

our future success significantly depends on the continued services and performance of our key management personnel we believe our management team’s depth and breadth of experience in our industry is integral to executing our business plan we also will need to continue to attract motivate and retain other key personnel the loss of services of members of our senior management team or other key employees the inability to attract additional qualified personnel as needed or failure to plan for the succession of senior management and key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business

net sales for electricalelectronic were 739 million in 2014 an increase of 30 from 2013 the increase in sales consists of an increase in sales volume of approximately 1 and a 29 sales contribution from acquisitions the benefit of higher transaction values associated with slight price inflation for the year was offset by the negative sales impact of copper pricing sales for electricalelectronic increased by 30 in the first quarter 32 in the second quarter 35 in the third quarter and 23 in the fourth quarter 

cost of goods sold 

the company includes in cost of goods sold the actual cost of merchandise which represents the vast majority of this line item other items in cost of goods sold include warranty costs and inbound freight from the supplier net of any vendor allowances and incentives cost of goods sold was 1072 billion in 2015 1075 billion in 2014 and 986 billion in 2013 cost of goods sold in 2015 and 2014 changed from the prior year periods in accordance with the related percentage change in sales for the same periods for these periods product inflation was relatively insignificant and actual costs were relatively unchanged from the prior year cost of goods sold represented 702 of net sales in 2015 701 of net sales in 2014 and 700 of net sales in 2013 and as a percent of net sales increased slightly in 2015 from 2014 and also in 2014 from 2013

operating expenses 

the company includes in selling administrative and other expenses “sga” all personnel and personnelrelated costs at its headquarters distribution centers stores and branches which accounts for approximately 65 of total sga additional costs in sga include our facilities delivery marketing advertising legal and professional costs 

sga of 328 billion in 2015 decreased by 37 million or approximately 1 from 2014 this represents 214 of net sales and compares favorably to 216 of net sales in 2014 the decrease in sga expenses as a percentage of net sales from the prior year reflect the positive impact of our cost control measures and our management teams’ focus on properly managing the company’s expenses we also continue to assess the optimal cost structure in our businesses depreciation and amortization expense was 142 million in 2015 a decrease of approximately 6 million or 4 from 2014 the provision for doubtful accounts was 12 million in 2015 up from 7 million in 2014 we believe the company is adequately reserved for bad debts at december 31 2015 

sga increased by 286 million or approximately 9 to 331 billion in 2014 representing 216 of net sales which compares to 215 of net sales in 2013 the increase in sga expenses as a percentage of net sales from the prior year primarily reflects the 54 million onetime gain net of other expense adjustments recorded to sga in the second quarter of 2013 as a purchase accounting adjustment associated with the april 1 2013 acquisition of gpc asia pacific our management teams remain focused on properly managing the company’s expenses and continuing to assess the appropriate cost structure in our businesses depreciation and amortization expense was 148 million in 2014 an increase of 14 million or 11 from 2013 this increase relates to higher depreciation and the amortization associated with acquisitions in both 2014 and 2013 the provision for doubtful accounts was 7 million in 2014 down from 9 million in 2013

nonoperating expenses and income 

nonoperating expenses consist primarily of interest interest expense was 22 million in 2015 25 million in 2014 and 27 million in 2013 the 3 million decrease in interest expense in 2015 reflects the impact of lower outstanding debt levels during the year relative to 2014 the 2 million decrease in interest expense in 2014 reflects the favorable interest rate on certain debt which was renewed in november 2013 

in “other” the net benefit of interest income equity method investment income investment dividends and noncontrolling interests in 2015 was 21 million a 2 million increase from the prior year due to higher interest income earned in 2015 relative to 2014 these items were 19 million in 2014 down from 22 million in 2013 the decrease of 3 million from the prior year was due to lower interest income earned in 2014 relative to 2013 

income before income taxes 

income before income taxes was 11 billion in 2015 a slight increase from 2014 as a percentage of net sales income before income taxes was 74 in 2015 compared to 73 in 2014 in 2014 income before income taxes of 11 billion was up 7 from 2013 and as a percentage of net sales was 73 compared to 74 in 2013 

automotive group 

automotive income before income taxes as a percentage of net sales which we refer to as operating margin increased to 91 in 2015 from 87 in 2014 this group’s initiatives to improve its gross margin and effectively manage its costs positively impacted automotive’s operating profit during the year looking forward planned initiatives to grow sales and control costs are intended to further improve its operating margin in the years ahead 

automotive’s operating margin of 87 in 2014 was up slightly from 86 in 2013 the change in operating costs as a percentage of net sales positively impacted operating profit during the year 

industrial group 

industrial’s operating margin decreased to 73 in 2015 from 78 in 2014 as the decline in sales for the year resulted in lower volume incentives which pressured gross margins and reduced expense leverage relative to 2014 the challenging market conditions for this business are expected to persist well into 2016 however industrial has multiple initiatives in place to help us overcome these challenges 

industrial’s operating margin improved to 78 in 2014 from 72 in 2013 as the combination of greater expense leverage associated with the increase in sales and generally improving gross margins primarily related to the increase in volume incentives positively impacted operating profit in 2014 

office group 

office’s operating margin decreased slightly to 73 in 2015 from 74 in 2014 primarily related to the deleveraging of expenses due to slower sales growth in the last half of the year office will continue to focus on its sales initiatives and cost control measures in 2016 

office’s operating margin decreased to 74 in 2014 down from 75 in 2013 primarily related to the lower operating margin generated by new business with a large primary customer this was partially offset by greater expense leverage driven by this group’s overall sales increase in 2014 

electricalelectronic group 

electricalelectronic’s operating margin increased to 93 in 2015 from 88 in 2014 as higher margin acquisitions declining copper prices and effective cost management positively impacted the operating margins for this group electricalelectronic will continue to focus on its sales initiatives and cost controls to further improve its operating margin in 2016 

electricalelectronic’s operating margin increased to 88 in 2014 from 84 in 2013 primarily due to greater expense leverage associated with this group’s sales increase in 2014 

  

income taxes 

the effective income tax rate of 372 in 2015 increased from 364 in 2014 the increase in rate primarily reflects the company’s higher mix of us earnings in 2015 which is taxed at a higher rate relative to our foreign operations to a lesser extent the less favorable retirement asset valuation adjustment in 2015 relative to 2014 impacted the increase in rate 

the income tax rate of 364 in 2014 increased from 344 in 2013 the increase in rate is primarily due to the favorable tax rate applied to the onetime gain associated with the gpc asia pacific acquisition recorded in 2013 additionally the company’s retirement asset valuation adjustment was less favorable in 2014 relative to 2013 the higher mix of us earnings taxed at a higher rate relative to our foreign operations also contributed to the increase in the 2014 tax rate 

net income 

net income was 706 million in 2015 a decrease of 1 from 711 million in 2014 on a per share diluted basis net income was 463 in 2015 up slightly compared to 461 in 2014 net income was 46 of net sales in 2015 and 2014

in connection with the acquisition of gpc asia pacific the company recorded onetime positive purchase accounting adjustments of 33 million or 021 per diluted share in 2013 before the impact of these adjustments net income in 2014 was up 9 from 2013 and on a per share diluted basis net income was up 10 from 2013 

financial condition 

our cash balance of 212 million at december 31 2015 compares to our cash balance of 138 million at december 31 2014 as discussed further below the company’s accounts receivable balance at december 31 2015 decreased by approximately 3 from the prior year this compares to the company’s 4 sales decrease for the fourth quarter of 2015 and we are satisfied with the quality and collectability of our accounts receivable inventory at december 31 2015 decreased by approximately 1 from december 31 2014 and accounts payable increased 267 million or approximately 10 from december 31 2014 due primarily to improved payment terms with certain suppliers 

liquidity and capital resources 

the company’s sources of capital consist primarily of cash flows from operations supplemented as necessary by private issuances of debt and bank borrowings we have 625 million of total debt outstanding at december 31 2015 of which 250 million matures in november 2016 and 250 million matures in december 2023 in addition the company has an unsecured revolving line of credit with a consortium of financial institutions for 12 billion of which approximately 125 million and 265 million were outstanding under the line of credit at december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively currently we believe that our cash on hand and available shortterm and longterm sources of capital are sufficient to fund the company’s operations including working capital requirements scheduled debt payments interest payments capital expenditures benefit plan contributions income tax obligations dividends share repurchases and contemplated acquisitions 

the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 14 to 1 at december 31 2015 and 16 to 1 at december 31 2014 our liquidity position remains solid the company’s total debt outstanding at december 31 2015 is down 140 million or 18 from december 31 2014

notes and other borrowings 

the company maintains a 12 billion unsecured revolving line of credit with a consortium of financial institutions which matures in june 2020 with two optional one year extensions and bears interest at libor plus a margin which is based on the company’s leverage ratio 117 at december 31 2015 the company also has the option under this agreement to increase its borrowing an additional 350 million as well as an option to decrease the borrowing capacity or terminate the facility with appropriate notice at december 31 2015 and 

  

2014 approximately 125 million and 265 million were outstanding under this line of credit respectively due to the workers’ compensation and insurance reserve requirements in certain states the company also had unused letters of credit of approximately 63 million outstanding at december 31 2015 and 2014

contractual and other obligations 

the following table shows the company’s approximate obligations and commitments including interest due on credit facilities to make future payments under specified contractual obligations as of december 31 2015 

contractual obligations 

 

 due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with the company’s unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2015 the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities therefore 18 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above refer to note 6 of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes 

purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in our estimates we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements our purchase orders are based on our current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons the company does not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements 

  

the company guarantees the borrowings of certain independently owned automotive parts stores independents and certain other affiliates in which the company has a noncontrolling equity ownership interest affiliates the company’s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these independents and affiliates is generally equal to the total borrowings subject to the company’s guarantee to date the company has had no significant losses in connection with guarantees of independents’ and affiliates’ borrowings the following table shows the company’s approximate commercial commitments as of december 31 2015 

other commercial commitments 

 

 in addition the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans that may obligate us to make contributions to the plans from time to time contributions in 2015 were 55 million we expect to make 49 million in cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit plans in 2016 and contributions required for 2016 and future years will depend on a number of unpredictable factors including the market performance of the plans’ assets and future changes in interest rates that affect the actuarial measurement of the plans’ obligations 

share repurchases 

in 2015 the company repurchased approximately 33 million shares and the company had remaining authority to purchase approximately 63 million shares at december 31 2015 

critical accounting policies 

general 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we describe in this section certain critical accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates assumptions and judgments an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially impact the consolidated financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for further information on the critical accounting policies see note 1 of the consolidated financial statements 

inventories — provisions for slow moving and obsolescence 

the company identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates appropriate provisions related thereto historically these losses have not been significant as the vast majority of the company’s inventories are 

  

not highly susceptible to obsolescence and are eligible for return under various vendor return programs while the company has no reason to believe its inventory return privileges will be discontinued in the future its risk of loss associated with obsolete or slow moving inventories would increase if such were to occur 

allowance for doubtful accounts — methodology 

the company evaluates the collectability of trade accounts receivable based on a combination of factors the company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on historical bad debt experience and periodically adjusts this estimate when the company becomes aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations eg bankruptcy filing or as a result of changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable while the company has a large customer base that is geographically dispersed a general economic downturn in any of the industry segments in which the company operates could result in higher than expected defaults and therefore the need to revise estimates for bad debts for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 the company recorded provisions for doubtful accounts of approximately 124 million 72 million and 87 million respectively 

consideration received from vendors 

the company enters into agreements at the beginning of each year with many of its vendors that provide for inventory purchase incentives generally the company earns inventory purchase incentives upon achieving specified volume purchasing levels or other criteria the company accrues for the receipt of these incentives as part of its inventory cost based on cumulative purchases of inventory to date and projected inventory purchases through the end of the year while management believes the company will continue to receive consideration from vendors in 2016 and beyond there can be no assurance that vendors will continue to provide comparable amounts of incentives in the future or that we will be able to achieve the specified volumes necessary to take advantage of such incentives 

impairment of property plant and equipment and goodwill and other intangible assets 

at least annually the company evaluates property plant and equipment goodwill and other intangible assets for potential impairment indicators the company’s judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance among other factors future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired evaluating for impairment also requires the company to estimate future operating results and cash flows which require judgment by management any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

employee benefit plans 

the company’s benefit plan committees in the us and canada establish investment policies and strategies and regularly monitor the performance of the company’s pension plan assets the pension plan investment strategy implemented by the company’s management is to achieve longterm objectives and invest the pension assets in accordance with the applicable pension legislation in the us and canada as well as fiduciary standards the longterm primary objectives for the pension plan funds are to provide for a reasonable amount of longterm growth of capital without undue exposure to risk protect the assets from erosion of purchasing power and provide investment results that meet or exceed the pension plans’ actuarially assumed long term rates of return the company’s investment strategy with respect to pension plan assets is to generate a return in excess of the passive portfolio benchmark 49 sp 500 index 5 russell mid cap index 8 russell 2000 index 5 msci eafe index 5 dj global moderate index and 28 barcap us govtcredit 

we make several critical assumptions in determining our pension plan assets and liabilities and related pension expense we believe the most critical of these assumptions are the expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate other assumptions we make relate to employee demographic factors such as rate of compensation increases mortality rates retirement patterns and turnover rates refer to note 7 of the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding these assumptions 

  

based on the investment policy for the pension plans as well as an asset study that was performed based on the company’s asset allocations and future expectations the company’s expected rate of return on plan assets for measuring 2016 pension expense or income is 783 for the plans the asset study forecasted expected rates of return for the approximate duration of the company’s benefit obligations using capital market data and historical relationships 

the discount rate is chosen as the rate at which pension obligations could be effectively settled and is based on capital market conditions as of the measurement date we have matched the timing and duration of the expected cash flows of our pension obligations to a yield curve generated from a broad portfolio of highquality fixed income debt instruments to select our discount rate based upon this cash flow matching analysis we selected a weighted average discount rate for the plans of 482 at december 31 2015

index to financial statements we may not be able to successfully implement our business initiatives in each of our four business segments to grow our sales and earnings which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have implemented numerous initiatives in each of our four business segments to grow sales and earnings including the introduction of new and expanded product lines strategic acquisitions geographic expansion including through acquisitions sales to new markets enhanced customer marketing programs and a variety of gross margin and cost savings initiatives if we are unable to implement these initiatives efficiently and effectively or if these initiatives are unsuccessful our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

successful implementation of these initiatives also depends on factors specific to the automotive parts industry and the other industries in which we operate and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control in addition to the other risk factors contained in this “item 1a risk factors” adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our business initiatives and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our business will be adversely affected if demand for our products slows 

our business depends on customer demand for the products that we distribute demand for these products depends on many factors 

with respect to our automotive group the primary factors are

 with respect to our industrial parts group the primary factors are 

 

  

  

  

 with respect to our office products group the primary factors are 

 

  

  

  

 with respect to our electricalelectronic materials group the primary factors are 

 

  

 uncertainty andor deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions including unemployment inflation or deflation changes in energy costs uncertain credit markets or other economic conditions could have a negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our business and operating results have been and may in the future be adversely affected by uncertain global economic conditions including domestic outputs employment rates inflation or deflation instability in credit markets declining consumer and business confidence fluctuating commodity prices interest rates volatile exchange rates and other challenges that could affect the global economy both our commercial and retail customers may experience deterioration of their financial resources which could result in existing or potential customers delaying or canceling plans to purchase our products our vendors could experience similar conditions which could impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us future weakness in the global economy could adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows in future periods 

we face substantial competition in the industries in which we do business 

the sale of automotive and industrial parts office products and electrical materials is highly competitive and impacted by many factors including name recognition product availability customer service changing customer preferences store location and pricing pressures because we seek to offer competitive prices if our competitors reduce their prices we may be forced to reduce our prices which could result in a material decline in 

  

index to financial statements our revenues and earnings increased competition among distributors of automotive and industrial parts office products and electronic materials including internetrelated initiatives could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations the company anticipates no decline in competition in any of its four business segments in the foreseeable future 

in particular the market for replacement automotive parts is highly competitive and subjects us to a wide variety of competitors we compete primarily with national and regional auto parts chains independently owned regional and local automotive parts and accessories stores automobile dealers that supply manufacturer replacement parts and accessories mass merchandisers and wholesale clubs that sell automotive products and regional and local full service automotive repair shops both new and established furthermore the automotive aftermarket has experienced consolidation in recent years consolidation among our competitors could further enhance their financial position provide them with the ability to provide more competitive prices to customers for whom we compete and allow them to achieve increased efficiencies in their consolidated operations that enable them to more effectively compete for customers if we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies or if our competitors develop more effective strategies we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

we depend on our relationships with our vendors and a disruption of our vendor relationships or a disruption in our vendors’ operations could harm our business 

as a distributor of automotive parts industrial parts office products and electricalelectronic materials our business depends on developing and maintaining close and productive relationships with our vendors we depend on our vendors to sell us quality products at favorable prices many factors outside our control including without limitation raw material shortages inadequate manufacturing capacity labor disputes transportation disruptions or weather conditions could adversely affect our vendors’ ability to deliver to us quality merchandise at favorable prices in a timely manner furthermore financial or operational difficulties with a particular vendor could cause that vendor to increase the cost of the products or decrease the quality of the products we purchase from it vendor consolidation could also limit the number of suppliers from which we may purchase products and could materially affect the prices we pay for these products in our automotive business the number of vendors could decrease considerably and the prices charged to us by the remaining vendors could increase to the extent that vehicle production slows due to a decline in consumer spending or other economic factor in addition we would suffer an adverse impact if our vendors limit or cancel the return privileges that currently protect us from inventory obsolescence 

if we experience a security breach if our internal information systems fail to function properly or if we are unsuccessful in implementing integrating or upgrading our information systems our business operations could be materially affected 

we depend on information systems to process customer orders manage inventory and accounts receivable collections purchase products manage accounts payable processes ship products to customers on a timely basis maintain cost effective operations provide superior service to customers and accumulate financial results despite our implementation of security measures our it systems are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses natural disasters unauthorized physical or electronic access power outages computer system or network failures cyberattacks and other similar disruptions maintaining and operating these measures requires continuous investments which the company has made and will continue to make a security breach could result in sensitive data being lost manipulated or exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public 

a serious prolonged disruption of our information systems for any of the above reasons could materially impair fundamental business processes and increase expenses decrease sales or otherwise reduce earnings furthermore such a breach may harm our reputation and business prospects and subject us to legal claims if there is loss disclosure or misappropriation of or access to our customers’ information as threats related to cyber security breaches develop and grow we may also find it necessary to make further investments to protect our data and infrastructure 

  

index to financial statements because we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees and other costs 

we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers employees or other third parties for various actions the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

additionally we are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to taxes environmental protection product quality standards building and zoning requirements as well as employment law matters if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs in addition our capital expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations 

we recognize the growing demand for businesstobusiness and businesstocustomer ecommerce options and we could lose business if we fail to provide the ecommerce options our customers wish to use 

our success in ecommerce depends on our ability to accurately identify the products to make available through ecommerce platforms across our business segments and to establish and maintain such platforms to provide the highest level of data security to our customers on and through the platforms our customers wish to use including mobile with rapidly changing technology in a highly competitive environment 

we are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel could harm our business 

our future success significantly depends on the continued services and performance of our key management personnel we believe our management team’s depth and breadth of experience in our industry is integral to executing our business plan we also will need to continue to attract motivate and retain other key personnel the loss of services of members of our senior management team or other key employees the inability to attract additional qualified personnel as needed or failure to plan for the succession of senior management and key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business

we recorded consolidated net sales of 153 billion for the year ended december 31 2014 an increase of 9 compared to 141 billion in 2013 consolidated net income for the year ended december 31 2014 was 711 million up 4 from 685 million in 2013 before the onetime income adjustment in 2013 related to the acquisition of gpc asia pacific net income was up 9 the company’s internal growth initiatives including the positive impact of acquisitions as well as effective cost management which we discuss further below served to drive our solid financial performance for the year each of our four business segments positively contributed to both our sales and earnings growth in 2014 

the 9 sales growth in 2014 follows an 8 revenue increase in 2013 and a 45 increase in revenues in 2012 the increase in net income in 2014 follows a 6 increase in net income in 2013 and a 15 increase in net income in 2012 in 2012 we experienced a relatively challenging sales environment and in 2013 we continued to experience difficult market conditions in the industrial electricalelectronic and office industries while the automotive business performed reasonably well over the three year period of 2012 through 2014 our financial performance was positively impacted by a variety of initiatives we implemented to grow sales and earnings in each of our four businesses examples of such initiatives include strategic acquisitions the introduction of new 

  

index to financial statements and expanded product lines geographic expansion sales to new markets enhanced customer marketing programs and a variety of gross margin and cost savings initiatives we discuss these initiatives further below 

with regard to the december 31 2014 consolidated balance sheet the company’s cash balance of 138 million compares to cash of 197 million at december 31 2013 the company continues to maintain a strong cash position supported by the increase in net income and effective asset management in 2014 accounts receivable increased by approximately 12 which compares to a 9 sales increase in the fourth quarter of the year and inventory was up by approximately 3 or 1 before the impact of acquisitions accounts payable increased 285 million or 13 from the prior year due primarily to improved payment terms with certain suppliers total debt outstanding at december 31 2014 was 765 million consistent with total debt at december 31 2013 

results of operations 

our results of operations are summarized below for the three years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 

 

 net sales 

consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31 2014 totaled 153 billion a 9 increase from 2013 and driven by revenue growth in each of our four business segments the increase in sales volume and acquisitions across our four businesses each contributed 5 to our total sales growth while currency negatively impacted total sales by 1 the impact of product inflation varied by business in 2014 and cumulatively prices were flat in the automotive segment up approximately 15 in the industrial segment up approximately 14 in the office segment and up approximately 03 in the electricalelectronic segment the company is well positioned to improve sales in 2015 

consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31 2013 totaled 141 billion an 8 increase from 2012 driven by an 185 increase in the automotive segment and offset by a 1 sales decrease in our nonautomotive businesses acquisitions primarily in automotive but also in the industrial and electricalelectronic businesses contributed 7 to our total sales growth and increased sales volume accounted for the remaining 1 the impact of product inflation varied by business in 2013 and cumulatively prices were flat in the automotive segment up approximately 1 in the industrial and electricalelectronic segments and up approximately 05 in the office segment 

automotive group 

net sales for the automotive group “automotive” were 81 billion in 2014 an increase of 8 from 2013 the increase in sales for the year consists of a positive comparable store sales increase of approximately 6 and approximately 4 from acquisitions these increases were offset by a 2 negative impact of currency associated with our automotive businesses in canada australasia and mexico automotive sales were not materially impacted by product inflation in 2014 automotive revenues were up 23 in the first quarter up 5 in the second quarter and up 4 in the third and fourth quarters the first quarter sales increase includes the impact of the gpc asia pacific acquisition which was anniversaried on april 1 2014 we believe that the underlying fundamentals in the automotive aftermarket including the overall number and age of the vehicle population remain solid and will serve to drive sustained demand for automotive aftermarket maintenance and supply items in 2015 based on these fundamentals and the internal growth initiatives in our automotive business we expect to grow our sales for this group again in 2015 

  

index to financial statements net sales for automotive were 75 billion in 2013 an increase of 185 from 2012 the increase in sales for the year was primarily due to the april 1 2013 acquisition of gpc asia pacific formerly exego and the may 1 2012 acquisition of quaker city motor parts co “quaker city” combined these acquisitions contributed approximately 15 to sales additionally automotive achieved a positive comparable store sales increase of approximately 4 offset slightly by the 05 negative impact of currency associated with our canadian business automotive sales were not materially impacted by product inflation or the effect of currency associated with our mexican businesses in 2013 automotive revenues were up 3 in the first quarter then up 22 in the second and third quarters and up 25 in the fourth quarter 

industrial group 

net sales for motion industries our industrial group “industrial” were 48 billion in 2014 an increase of 8 from 2013 sales volumes in industrial were up approximately 45 from the prior year while higher transaction values associated with product inflation added 15 and acquisitions contributed approximately 3 to sales in 2014 these items were offset by a 1 negative impact of currency associated with our canadian business industrial revenues were up 4 in the first quarter of 2014 up 7 in the second quarter and up 10 in the third and fourth quarters we expect the internal growth initiatives and relatively healthy industry conditions to provide us additional growth opportunities for our industrial business in 2015 

net sales for industrial were 44 billion in 2013 down slightly compared to 2012 sales volumes in this business were down approximately 1 from the prior year while higher transaction values associated with product inflation added 1 to sales in 2013 the slight positive impact on sales from acquisitions was offset by the slight negative impact of currency associated with our canadian business industrial revenues were down 2 in the first quarter of 2013 down 1 in the second quarter down 25 in the third quarter and up 3 in the fourth quarter of 2013 

office group 

net sales for s p richards our office products group “office” were 18 billion in 2014 an increase of 10 from 2013 the increase in sales reflects a 4 increase in sales volume a 14 increase in higher transaction values associated with price inflation and a 5 contribution from acquisitions these items were offset by the slight negative impact of currency associated with our canadian operations in 2014 office experienced improving industry conditions as evidenced by consistently stronger new jobs reports relative to 2013 as well as a strengthening us gdp these conditions combined with new business with a primary customer effective july 1 2014 served to drive the increased sales volume for the year sales were unchanged in the first quarter up 4 in the second quarter up 15 in the third quarter and up 22 in the fourth quarter of 2014 we will continue to focus on our growth initiatives including the ongoing diversification of product and customer portfolios market share gains and acquisitions to further improve the office business in 2015 

net sales for office were 16 billion in 2013 a 3 decrease in sales from 2012 the industrywide weakness in office products consumption driven by the ongoing elevated levels of white collar unemployment and the declining demand for paper and paper based office products due to workplace digitization continued to pressure this segment throughout 2013 overall sales volume in office declined by approximately 35 for the year offset by the benefit of slightly higher transaction values associated with price inflation of 05 sales decreased by 1 in the first quarter 3 in the second and third quarters and 4 in the fourth quarter of 2013 

electricalelectronic group 

net sales for eis our electrical and electronic group “electricalelectronic” were 739 million in 2014 an increase of 30 from 2013 the increase in sales consists of an increase in sales volume of approximately 1 and a 29 sales contribution from acquisitions the benefit of higher transaction values associated with slight price inflation for the year was offset by the negative sales impact of copper pricing sales for electricalelectronic increased by 30 in the first quarter 32 in the second quarter 35 in the third quarter and 23 in the fourth quarter we expect a gradually improving customer climate to support stronger underlying sales growth for the electricalelectronic business in 2015 

  

index to financial statements net sales for electricalelectronic decreased to 569 million in 2013 down 2 from 2012 the decrease in revenues was attributable to several factors as sales volume was down by 5 and copper pricing negatively impacted sales by 1 relative to 2012 these items were partially offset by a 3 positive sales contribution from acquisitions and the benefit of higher transaction values associated with 1 price inflation for the year sales for electricalelectronic decreased by 5 in the first quarter 4 in the second quarter and 5 in the third quarter and were up 6 in the fourth quarter 

cost of goods sold 

the company includes in cost of goods sold the actual cost of merchandise which represents the vast majority of this line item other items in cost of goods sold include warranty costs and inbound freight from the supplier net of any vendor allowances and incentives cost of goods sold was 107 billion 99 billion and 92 billion in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the 9 and 7 increases in cost of goods sold in 2014 from 2013 and 2013 from 2012 respectively are directly related to the sales increase for the same periods as product inflation was relatively insignificant and actual costs were relatively unchanged from the prior year cost of goods sold represented 701 of net sales in 2014 700 of net sales in 2013 and 710 of net sales in 2012 cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales in 2014 is relatively consistent with 2013 the 100 basis point decrease in cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales in 2013 from 2012 primarily reflects the positive gross margin impact of the 100 company owned store model at gpc asia pacific 

in 2014 and 2013 the industrial office and electricalelectronic business segments experienced slight vendor price increases in 2012 only the industrial and office business segments experienced vendor price increases in any year where we experience price increases we are able to work with our customers to pass most of these along to them 

operating expenses 

the company includes in selling administrative and other expenses “sga” all personnel and personnelrelated costs at its headquarters distribution centers and stores which accounts for approximately 65 of total sga additional costs in sga include our facilities delivery marketing advertising legal and professional costs 

sga increased by 286 million or approximately 9 to 33 billion in 2014 representing 216 of net sales which compares to 215 of net sales in 2013 the increase in sga expenses as a percentage of net sales from the prior year primarily reflects the 54 million onetime gain net of other expense adjustments recorded to sga in the second quarter of 2013 as a purchase accounting adjustment associated with the april 1 2013 acquisition of gpc asia pacific our management teams remain focused on properly managing the company’s expenses and continuing to assess the appropriate cost structure in our businesses depreciation and amortization expense was 148 million in 2014 an increase of 14 million or 11 from 2013 this increase relates to higher depreciation and the amortization associated with acquisitions in both 2014 and 2013 the provision for doubtful accounts was 7 million in 2014 down from 9 million in 2013 we believe the company is adequately reserved for bad debts at december 31 2014 

sga increased by 371 million or approximately 14 to 30 billion in 2013 representing 215 of net sales which compares to 204 of net sales in 2012 primarily the increase in sga expenses as a percentage of net sales from the prior year is due to the 100 company owned store model at gpc asia pacific which serves to increase both gross profit and sga expenses additionally we experienced decreased expense leverage in 2013 associated with the weak sales environment in our nonautomotive businesses throughout the year these items were partially offset by a 54 million onetime gain net of other expense adjustments recorded to sga in the second quarter of 2013 as a purchase accounting adjustment associated with the april 1 2013 acquisition of gpc asia pacific depreciation and amortization expense was 134 million in 2013 an increase of 36 million or 36 from 2012 this increase primarily relates to the depreciation for higher levels of capital expenditures and the amortization associated with acquisitions during the year the provision for doubtful accounts was 9 million in 2013 an increase from 8 million in 2012

nonoperating expenses and income 

nonoperating expenses consist primarily of interest interest expense was 25 million in 2014 27 million in 2013 and 20 million in 2012 the 2 million decrease in interest expense in 2014 reflects the favorable interest rate on certain debt which was renewed in november 2013 the 7 million increase in interest expense in 2013 is due to higher debt levels incurred for the gpc asia pacific acquisition 

in “other” the net benefit of interest income equity method investment income investment dividends and noncontrolling interests in 2014 was 19 million a decrease of 3 million from the prior year due to lower interest income earned in 2014 relative to 2013 these items were 22 million in 2013 down approximately 2 million from 2012 as this line reflected the company’s equity income recorded in 2012 for its 30 investment interest in gpc asia pacific 

income before income taxes

automotive group 

automotive income before income taxes as a percentage of net sales which we refer to as operating margin increased to 87 in 2014 a slight increase from 86 in 2013 the change in operating costs as a percentage of net sales positively impacted operating profit during the year looking forward automotive’s initiatives to grow sales and control costs are intended to improve its operating margin in the years ahead 

automotive’s operating margin of 86 in 2013 was steady with the prior year the changes in gross profit and operating costs as a percentage of net sales which related primarily to the acquisition of gpc asia pacific were relatively neutral to operating profit during the year

industrial’s operating margin improved to 78 in 2014 from 72 in 2013 as the combination of greater expense leverage associated with the increase in sales and generally improving gross margins primarily related to the increase in volume incentives positively impacted operating profit in 2014 industrial will continue to focus on its many sales initiatives and cost control measures to further improve its operating margin in 2015 

industrial’s operating margin decreased to 72 in 2013 from 79 in 2012 the decrease in operating margin in 2013 was due to the combination of reduced expense leverage associated with the slight decrease in sales relative to the prior year and the decline in volume incentives for the year these items were partially offset by effective cost control measures 

office group 

office’s operating margin decreased to 74 in 2014 down from 75 in 2013 primarily related to the lower operating margin generated by new business with a large primary customer this was partially offset by greater expense leverage driven by this group’s overall sales increase in 2014 office will continue to focus on its sales initiatives and cost controls to maintain its operating margin in 2015 

office’s operating margin decreased to 75 in 2013 from 80 in 2012 primarily related to the reduced expense leverage associated with the decrease in sales for this segment relative to 2012 

  

index to financial statements electricalelectronic group 

electricalelectronic’s operating margin increased to 88 in 2014 from 84 in 2013 primarily due to greater expense leverage associated with this group’s sales increase in 2014 electricalelectronic will continue to focus on its sales initiatives and cost controls to improve its operating margin in 2015 

electricalelectronic’s operating margin was 84 in 2013 down from 87 in 2012 the decline in operating margin reflects the loss of expense leverage associated with the sales decrease for this segment in 2013 relative to 2012 

income taxes 

the effective income tax rate of 364 in 2014 increased from 344 in 2013 the increase in rate is primarily due to the favorable tax rate applied to the onetime gain associated with the gpc asia pacific acquisition recorded in 2013 additionally the company’s retirement asset valuation adjustment was less favorable in 2014 relative to 2013 the higher mix of us earnings taxed at a higher rate relative to our foreign operations also contributed to the increase in the 2014 tax rate 

in 2013 the income tax rate of 344 was down from 364 in 2012 the decrease reflects the favorable impact of the lower australian tax rate applied to the pretax earnings of gpc asia pacific as well as the favorable tax rate applied to the onetime acquisition gain in 2013 

net income 

net income was 711 million in 2014 an increase of 4 from 685 million in 2013 on a per share diluted basis net income was 461 in 2014 compared to 440 in 2013 up 5 net income in 2014 was 46 of net sales compared to 49 of net sales in 2013 

in connection with the acquisition of gpc asia pacific the company recorded onetime positive purchase accounting adjustments of 33 million or 021 per diluted share in 2013 before the impact of these adjustments net income in 2014 was up 9 from 2013 and on a per share diluted basis net income was up 10 from 2013 

net income was 685 million in 2013 an increase of 6 from 648 million in 2012 on a per share diluted basis net income was 440 in 2013 compared to 414 in 2012 up 6 net income in 2013 was 49 of net sales compared to 50 of net sales in 2012 

financial condition 

our cash balance of 138 million at december 31 2014 compares to our cash balance of 197 million at december 31 2013 the company’s accounts receivable balance at december 31 2014 increased by approximately 12 from the prior year greater than the company’s 9 sales increase for the fourth quarter of 2014 however we are satisfied with the quality and collectability of our accounts receivable inventory at december 31 2014 increased by approximately 3 from december 31 2013 and excluding acquisitions was up by approximately 1 from the prior year accounts payable increased 285 million or approximately 13 from december 31 2013 due primarily to improved payment terms with certain suppliers combined goodwill and other intangible assets increased by 97 million or 8 from december 31 2013 due to the company’s acquisitions during the year the change in our december 31 2014 balances for deferred tax assets which increased 48 million and pension and other postretirement benefits liabilities up 189 million from december 31 2013 is primarily due to changes in the discount rate as well as recent changes in the mortality assumptions used for the company’s pension plans in 2014 

liquidity and capital resources 

the company’s sources of capital consist primarily of cash flows from operations supplemented as necessary by private issuances of debt and bank borrowings we have 765 million of total debt outstanding at december 31 2014 of which 250 million matures in november 2016 and 250 million matures in december 2023 in addition the company has a syndicated facility agreement the “syndicated facility” for 

  

index to financial statements 850 million of which approximately 265 million was outstanding under the syndicated facility or line of credit at december 31 2014 and 2013 currently we believe that our cash on hand and available shortterm and longterm sources of capital are sufficient to fund the company’s operations including working capital requirements scheduled debt payments interest payments capital expenditures benefit plan contributions income tax obligations dividends share repurchases and contemplated acquisitions 

the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 16 to 1 at december 31 2014 and 2013 our liquidity position remains solid the company’s total debt outstanding at december 31 2014 is unchanged from december 31 2013 

sources and uses of net cash 

a summary of the company’s consolidated statements of cash flows is as follows 

 

 net cash provided by operating activities 

the company continues to generate cash and in 2014 net cash provided by operating activities totaled 790 million this reflects a 25 decrease from 2013 due primarily to the change in trade accounts receivable merchandise inventories and trade accounts payable which collectively net to a 34 million use of cash in 2014 compared to a 278 million source of cash in 2013 net cash provided by operating activities was 11 billion in 2013 a 17 increase from 2012 as collectively trade accounts receivable merchandise inventories and trade accounts payable represented a 278 million source of cash in 2013 compared to a 208 million source of cash in 2012 additionally net income and depreciation and amortization increased by 37 million and 36 million respectively in 2013 

net cash used in investing activities 

net cash flow used in investing activities was 387 million in 2014 compared to 826 million in 2013 a decrease of 53 cash used for acquisitions of businesses and other investing activities in 2014 was 288 million or 424 million less than in 2013 capital expenditures of 108 million in 2014 decreased by 16 million or 13 from 2013 and were slightly lower than our estimate of 120 to 130 million for the year we estimate that cash used for capital expenditures in 2015 will be approximately 125 to 145 million net cash flow used in investing activities was 826 million in 2013 compared to 652 million in 2012 an increase of 27 cash used for acquisitions of businesses and other investing activities in 2013 was 712 million or 154 million greater than in 2012 additionally capital expenditures of 124 million in 2013 increased by 22 million or 22 from 2012 which was within our estimate of 115 to 135 million for the year 

net cash used in financing activities 

the company used 455 million of cash in financing activities in 2014 up 7 from the 425 million used in financing activities in 2013 cash used in financing activities in 2013 was up 46 million or 12 from the 379 million used in 2012 for the three years presented net cash used in financing activities was primarily for dividends paid to shareholders and repurchases of the company’s common stock the company paid dividends to shareholders of 347 million 326 million and 301 million during 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the company expects this trend of increasing dividends to continue in the foreseeable future during 2014 2013 and 2012 the company repurchased 96 million 121 million and 82 million respectively of the company’s common stock we expect to remain active in our share repurchase program but the amount and value of shares repurchased will vary 

  

index to financial statements notes and other borrowings 

the company maintains an 850 million unsecured revolving line of credit with a consortium of financial institutions which matures in september 2017 and bears interest at libor plus a margin which is based on the company’s leverage ratio 092 at december 31 2014 the company also has the option under this agreement to increase its borrowing an additional 350 million as well as an option to decrease the borrowing capacity or terminate the syndicated facility with appropriate notice at december 31 2014 and 2013 approximately 265 million was outstanding under this line of credit due to the workers’ compensation and insurance reserve requirements in certain states the company also had unused letters of credit of approximately 63 million and 62 million outstanding at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively 

at december 31 2014 the company had unsecured senior notes outstanding under financing arrangement as follows 250 million series d and e senior unsecured notes 335 fixed due 2016 and 250 million series f senior unsecured notes 299 fixed due 2023 these borrowings contain covenants related to a maximum debttocapitalization ratio and certain limitations on additional borrowings at december 31 2014 the company was in compliance with all such covenants the weighted average interest rate on the company’s total outstanding borrowings was approximately 246 at december 31 2014 and 282 at december 31 2013 total interest expense net of interest income for all borrowings was 242 million 243 million and 196 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

contractual and other obligations 

the following table shows the company’s approximate obligations and commitments including interest due on credit facilities to make future payments under specified contractual obligations as of december 31 2014 

contractual obligations 

 

 due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with the company’s unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2014 the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities therefore 19 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above refer to note 6 of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes 

purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in our estimates we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements our purchase orders are based on our current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons the company does not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements 

  

index to financial statements the company guarantees the borrowings of certain independently owned automotive parts stores independents and certain other affiliates in which the company has a noncontrolling equity ownership interest affiliates the company’s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these independents and affiliates is generally equal to the total borrowings subject to the company’s guarantee to date the company has had no significant losses in connection with guarantees of independents’ and affiliates’ borrowings the following table shows the company’s approximate commercial commitments as of december 31 2014 

other commercial commitments 

 

 in addition the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans that may obligate us to make contributions to the plans from time to time contributions in 2014 were 53 million we expect to make a 50 million cash contribution to our qualified defined benefit plans in 2015 and contributions required for 2015 and future years will depend on a number of unpredictable factors including the market performance of the plans’ assets and future changes in interest rates that affect the actuarial measurement of the plans’ obligations 

share repurchases 

in 2014 the company repurchased approximately 11 million shares and the company had remaining authority to purchase approximately 95 million shares at december 31 2014 

critical accounting policies 

general 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we describe in this section certain critical accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates assumptions and judgments an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially impact the consolidated financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for further information on the critical accounting policies see note 1 of the consolidated financial statements 

inventories — provisions for slow moving and obsolescence 

the company identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates appropriate provisions related thereto historically these loss provisions have not been significant as the vast majority of the company’s 

  

index to financial statements inventories are not highly susceptible to obsolescence and are eligible for return under various vendor return programs while the company has no reason to believe its inventory return privileges will be discontinued in the future its risk of loss associated with obsolete or slow moving inventories would increase if such were to occur 

allowance for doubtful accounts — methodology 

the company evaluates the collectability of trade accounts receivable based on a combination of factors the company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on historical bad debt experience and periodically adjusts this estimate when the company becomes aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations eg bankruptcy filing or as a result of changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable while the company has a large customer base that is geographically dispersed a general economic downturn in any of the industry segments in which the company operates could result in higher than expected defaults and therefore the need to revise estimates for bad debts for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 the company recorded provisions for doubtful accounts of 72 million 87 million and 80 million respectively 

consideration received from vendors 

the company enters into agreements at the beginning of each year with many of its vendors that provide for inventory purchase incentives generally the company earns inventory purchase incentives upon achieving specified volume purchasing levels or other criteria the company accrues for the receipt of these incentives as part of its inventory cost based on cumulative purchases of inventory to date and projected inventory purchases through the end of the year while management believes the company will continue to receive consideration from vendors in 2015 and beyond there can be no assurance that vendors will continue to provide comparable amounts of incentives in the future or that we will be able to achieve the specified volumes necessary to take advantage of such incentives 

impairment of property plant and equipment and goodwill and other intangible assets 

at least annually the company evaluates property plant and equipment goodwill and other intangible assets for potential impairment indicators the company’s judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance among other factors future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired evaluating for impairment also requires the company to estimate future operating results and cash flows which require judgment by management any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

employee benefit plans 

the company’s benefit plan committees in the us and canada establish investment policies and strategies and regularly monitor the performance of the company’s pension plan assets the pension plan investment strategy implemented by the company’s management is to achieve longterm objectives and invest the pension assets in accordance with the applicable pension legislation in the us and canada as well as fiduciary standards the longterm primary objectives for the pension plan funds are to provide for a reasonable amount of longterm growth of capital without undue exposure to risk protect the assets from erosion of purchasing power and provide investment results that meet or exceed the pension plans’ actuarially assumed long term rates of return the company’s investment strategy with respect to pension plan assets is to generate a return in excess of the passive portfolio benchmark 49 sp 500 index 5 russell mid cap index 8 russell 2000 index 5 msci eafe index 5 dj global moderate index and 28 barcap us govtcredit 

we make several critical assumptions in determining our pension plan assets and liabilities and related pension expense we believe the most critical of these assumptions are the expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate other assumptions we make relate to employee demographic factors such as rate of compensation increases mortality rates retirement patterns and turnover rates refer to note 7 of the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding these assumptions 

  

index to financial statements based on the investment policy for the pension plans as well as an asset study that was performed based on the company’s asset allocations and future expectations the company’s expected rate of return on plan assets for measuring 2015 pension expense or income is 784 for the plans the asset study forecasted expected rates of return for the approximate duration of the company’s benefit obligations using capital market data and historical relationships 

the discount rate is chosen as the rate at which pension obligations could be effectively settled and is based on capital market conditions as of the measurement date we have matched the timing and duration of the expected cash flows of our pension obligations to a yield curve generated from a broad portfolio of highquality fixed income debt instruments to select our discount rate based upon this cash flow matching analysis we selected a weighted average discount rate for the plans of 426 at december 31 2014 

net periodic benefit income cost for our defined benefit pension plans was 96 million 511 million and 268 million for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the income associated with the pension plans in 2014 reflects the impact of the 2012 amendment to freeze the us defined benefit pension plan effective december 31 2013 additionally the increase in pension cost in 2013 from 2012 was primarily due to the curtailment gain recorded in connection with the 2012 amendment to the us defined benefit pension plan the 2012 amendment and related curtailment decreased benefit costs in 2012 and are discussed further below refer to note 7 of the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding employee benefit plans 

in december 2012 the company’s us defined benefit plan was amended to reflect a hard freeze as of december 31 2013 no further benefit accruals were provided after that date for additional credited service or earnings and all participants who are employed after december 31 2013 became fully vested as of december 31 2013 the company recorded a 235 million noncash curtailment gain in december 2012 in connection with this amendment 

quarterly results of operations 

the following is a summary of the quarterly results of operations for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 

 

 we recorded the quarterly earnings per share amounts as if each quarter was a discrete period as a result the sum of the basic and diluted earnings per share will not necessarily total the annual basic and diluted earnings per share 

  

index to financial statements the preparation of interim consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the amounts reported in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements specifically the company makes estimates and assumptions in its interim condensed consolidated financial statements for inventory adjustments the accrual of bad debts customer sales returns and volume incentives earned among others inventory adjustments including adjustments for a majority of inventories that are valued under the lastin firstout lifo method are accrued on an interim basis and adjusted in the fourth quarter based on the annual book to physical inventory adjustment and lifo valuation which is performed each yearend reserves for bad debts and customer sales returns are estimated and accrued on an interim basis based upon historical experience volume incentives are estimated based upon cumulative and projected purchasing levels the estimates and assumptions for interim reporting may change upon final determination at yearend and such changes may be significant the effect of these adjustments in 2014 and 2013 was not significant

 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  tableend although the company does not face material risks related to interest rates and commodity prices the company is exposed to changes in foreign currency rates with respect to foreign currency denominated operating revenues and expenses 

foreign currency 

the company has translation gains or losses that result from translation of the results of operations of an operating unit’s foreign functional currency into us dollars for consolidated financial statement purposes the company’s principal foreign currency exchange exposure is the canadian dollar the functional currency of our canadian operations the australian dollar the functional currency of our australasian operations and to a lesser extent the mexican peso the functional currency of our mexican operations foreign currency exchange exposure particularly in regard to the canadian and australian dollar and to a lesser extent the mexican peso negatively impacted our results for the year ended december 31 2014 

during 2014 and 2013 it was estimated that a 10 shift in exchange rates between those foreign functional currencies and the us dollar would have impacted translated net sales by approximately 258 million and 255 million respectively a 15 shift in exchange rates between those functional currencies and the us dollar would have impacted translated net sales by approximately 388 million in 2014 and 382 million in 2013

our business will be adversely affected if demand for our products slows 

our business depends on customer demand for the products that we distribute demand for these products depends on many factors 

with respect to our automotive group the primary factors are

 with respect to our industrial parts group the primary factors are 

 

  

  

  

 with respect to our office products group the primary factors are 

 

  

  

 with respect to our electricalelectronic materials group the primary factors are 

 

  

 uncertainty andor deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions including unemployment inflation or deflation high energy costs uncertain credit markets or other economic conditions could have a negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our business and operating results may in the future be adversely affected by uncertain global economic conditions including instability in credit markets declining consumer and business confidence fluctuating commodity prices volatile exchange rates and other challenges that could affect the global economy both our commercial and retail customers may experience deterioration of their financial resources which could result in existing or potential customers delaying or canceling plans to purchase our products our vendors could experience similar conditions which could impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us future weakness in the global economy could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows in future periods 

we depend on our relationships with our vendors and a disruption of our vendor relationships or a disruption in our vendors’ operations could harm our business 

as a distributor of automotive parts industrial parts office products and electricalelectronic materials our business depends on developing and maintaining close and productive relationships with our vendors we depend 

  

index to financial statements on our vendors to sell us quality products at favorable prices many factors outside our control including without limitation raw material shortages inadequate manufacturing capacity labor disputes transportation disruptions or weather conditions could adversely affect our vendors’ ability to deliver to us quality merchandise at favorable prices in a timely manner furthermore financial or operational difficulties with a particular vendor could cause that vendor to increase the cost of the products or decrease the quality of the products we purchase from it vendor consolidation could also limit the number of suppliers from which we may purchase products and could materially affect the prices we pay for these products in our automotive business the number of vendors could decrease considerably and the prices charged to us by the remaining vendors could increase to the extent that vehicle production slows due to a decline in consumer spending and possibly the failure of one or more of the large automobile manufacturers we would suffer an adverse impact if our vendors limit or cancel the return privileges that currently protect us from inventory obsolescence 

we face substantial competition in the industries in which we do business 

the sale of automotive and industrial parts office products and electrical materials is highly competitive and impacted by many factors including name recognition product availability customer service anticipating changing customer preferences store location and pricing pressures because we seek to offer competitive prices if our competitors reduce their prices we may be forced to reduce our prices which could result in a material decline in our revenues and earnings increased competition among distributors of automotive and industrial parts office products and electronic materials including internetrelated initiatives could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations the company anticipates no decline in competition in any of its four business segments in the foreseeable future 

in particular the market for replacement automotive parts is highly competitive and subjects us to a wide variety of competitors we compete primarily with national and regional auto parts chains independently owned regional and local automotive parts and accessories stores automobile dealers that supply manufacturer replacement parts and accessories mass merchandisers and wholesale clubs that sell automotive products and regional and local full service automotive repair shops furthermore the automotive aftermarket has experienced consolidation in recent years consolidation among our competitors could further enhance their financial position provide them with the ability to provide more competitive prices to customers for whom we compete and allow them to achieve increased efficiencies in their consolidated operations that enable them to more effectively compete for customers if we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies or if our competitors develop more effective strategies we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

we may not be able to successfully implement our business initiatives in each of our four business segments to grow our sales and earnings which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have implemented numerous initiatives in each of our four business segments to grow sales and earnings including the introduction of new and expanded product lines strategic acquisitions geographic expansion including through acquisitions sales to new markets enhanced customer marketing programs and a variety of gross margin and cost savings initiatives if we are unable to implement these initiatives efficiently and effectively or if these initiatives are unsuccessful our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

successful implementation of these initiatives also depends on factors specific to the automotive parts industry and the other industries in which we operate and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control in addition to the other risk factors contained in this “item 1a risk factors” adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our business initiatives and have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

  

   

index to financial statements   

  

  

 because we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees and other costs 

we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers employees or other third parties for various actions the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim this could have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

additionally we are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to environmental protection product quality standards building and zoning requirements as well as employment law matters if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs in addition our capital expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations

 item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  tableend overview 

genuine parts company is a service organization engaged in the distribution of automotive parts industrial parts office products and electricalelectronic materials we have a long tradition of growth dating back to 1928 the year we were founded in atlanta georgia in 2013 the company conducted business throughout the united states canada australia new zealand mexico and puerto rico from approximately 2600 locations 

we recorded consolidated net sales of 141 billion for the year ended december 31 2013 an increase of 8 compared to 130 billion in 2012 consolidated net income for the year ended december 31 2013 was 685 million up 6 from 648 million in 2012 the company’s internal growth initiatives including the positive impact of acquisitions as well as effective cost management which we discuss further below served to drive our solid financial performance for the year despite the challenging market conditions that were experienced by our nonautomotive business segments 

the 8 sales growth in 2013 follows a 45 revenue increase in 2012 and an 11 increase in revenues in 2011 our 6 increase in net income follows a 15 increase in net income in 2012 and a 19 increase in net income in 2011 in 2011 we experienced strong and steady growth in three of our four business segments as conditions in these industries improved significantly from the depressed levels associated with the recessionary period of 2009 these favorable conditions began to moderate following the first quarter of 2012 which created a more challenging sales environment over the balance of the year in 2013 we continued to experience difficult market conditions in the industrial electricalelectronic and office industries while the automotive business performed reasonably well over the three year period of 2011 through 2013 our financial performance was positively impacted by a variety of initiatives we implemented to grow sales and earnings in each of our four 

  

index to financial statements businesses examples of such initiatives include strategic acquisitions the introduction of new and expanded product lines geographic expansion sales to new markets enhanced customer marketing programs and a variety of gross margin and cost savings initiatives we discuss these initiatives further below 

with regard to the december 31 2013 consolidated balance sheet the company’s cash balance of 197 million was down from cash of 403 million at december 31 2012 due primarily to recent acquisitions in our automotive industrial and electricalelectronic business segments during 2013 which are discussed further under liquidity and capital resources the company continues to maintain a strong cash position supported by the increase in net income and ongoing working capital management in 2013 accounts receivable increased by approximately 12 which is less than our sales increase in the fourth quarter of the year and inventory was up by approximately 13 or approximately 1 before the impact of acquisitions accounts payable increased 588 million or 35 from the prior year the significant increase in this line item is due primarily to improved payment terms with certain suppliers additionally accounts payable associated with acquisitions accounted for approximately 10 of the increase total debt outstanding at december 31 2013 was 765 million an increase of 265 million from 500 million at december 31 2012 

results of operations 

our results of operations are summarized below for the three years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 

 

 net sales 

consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31 2013 totaled 141 billion an 8 increase from 2012 driven by an 185 increase in the automotive segment that was offset by a 1 sales decrease in our nonautomotive businesses acquisitions primarily in automotive but also in the industrial and electricalelectronic businesses contributed 7 to our total sales growth and increased sales volume accounted for the remaining 1 the impact of product inflation varied by business again in 2013 and cumulatively prices were flat in the automotive segment up approximately 1 in the industrial and electricalelectronic segments and up approximately 05 in the office segment the company is well positioned to improve sales in 2014 

consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31 2012 totaled 130 billion a 45 increase from 2011 and driven by sales increases in three of our four business segments acquisitions in our automotive and electrical businesses contributed 2 to our sales growth and increased sales volume added approximately 2 to sales the impact of product inflation varied by business as cumulatively prices in 2012 were flat in the automotive segment up approximately 2 in the industrial segment flat in the electricalelectronic segment and up approximately 3 in the office segment 

automotive group 

net sales for the automotive group “automotive” were 75 billion in 2013 an increase of 185 from 2012 the increase in sales for the year was primarily due to the april 1 2013 acquisition of gpc asia pacific formerly exego and the may 1 2012 acquisition of quaker city motor parts co “quaker city” combined these acquisitions contributed approximately 15 to sales additionally automotive achieved a positive comparable store sales increase of approximately 4 offset slightly by the 05 negative impact of currency associated with our canadian business automotive sales were not materially impacted by product inflation or the effect of currency associated with our mexican businesses in 2013 automotive revenues were up 3 in the first quarter then up 22 in the second and third quarters and up 25 in the fourth quarter we believe that the 

  

index to financial statements underlying fundamentals in the automotive aftermarket including the overall aging of the vehicle population remain solid and will serve to drive increased demand for automotive aftermarket maintenance and supply items in 2014 based on these fundamentals and the internal growth initiatives in our automotive business we expect to grow our sales for this group again in 2014 

net sales for automotive were 63 billion in 2012 an increase of 4 from 2011 the increase in sales for the year was primarily due to the may 1 2012 acquisition of quaker city which contributed approximately 3 to sales additionally automotive achieved a positive comparable store sales increase of slightly more than 1 automotive sales were not materially impacted by product inflation or the effect of currency associated with our canadian and mexican businesses in 2012 automotive revenues were up 6 in the first quarter then up 4 in the second quarter up 25 in the third quarter and up 5 in the fourth quarter 

industrial group 

net sales for motion industries our industrial group “industrial” were 44 billion in 2013 down slightly compared to 2012 sales volumes in this business were down approximately 1 from the prior year while higher transaction values associated with product inflation added 1 to sales in 2013 the slight positive impact on sales from acquisitions was offset by the slight negative impact of currency associated with our canadian business industrial revenues were down 2 in the first quarter of 2013  down 1 in the second quarter down 25 in the third quarter and up 3 in the fourth quarter we expect the recent acquisitions for this business segment as well as other internal growth initiatives and relatively stable manufacturing indicators to provide us ample growth opportunities for our industrial business in 2014 

net sales for industrial were 45 billion in 2012 an increase of 7 compared to 2011 the positive impact of industrial’s internal sales initiatives which drove higher sales volume contributed 5 to sales higher transaction values in 2012 associated with product inflation added another 2 to sales there was no material impact on sales from acquisitions and no effect of currency associated with our canadian business industrial revenues were up 12 in the first quarter of 2012 up 8 in the second quarter then up 45 and 2 in the third and fourth quarters respectively 

office group 

net sales for s p richards our office products group “office” were 16 billion in 2013 a 3 decrease in sales from 2012 the industrywide weakness in office products consumption driven by the ongoing elevated levels of white collar unemployment and the declining demand for paper and paperbased office products due to workplace digitization continues to pressure this segment and we do not expect any meaningful improvement in these conditions in the near future overall sales volume in office declined by approximately 35 for the year offset by the benefit of slightly higher transaction values associated with price inflation of 05 sales decreased by 1 in the first quarter 3 in the second and third quarters and 4 in the fourth quarter of 2013 our focus in 2014 will be on market share initiatives product line extensions and further diversification of our product and customer portfolios 

net sales for office were 17 billion in 2012 flat with revenues in 2011 overall sales volume in office declined by 3 for the year offset by higher transaction values associated with price inflation of approximately 3 sales decreased by 1 in the first second and third quarters and were up 3 in the fourth quarter of 2012 

electricalelectronic group 

net sales for eis our electrical and electronic group “electricalelectronic” decreased to 569 million in 2013 down 2 from 2012 the decrease in revenues is attributable to several factors as sales volume was down by 5 and copper pricing negatively impacted sales by 1 relative to 2012 these items were partially offset by a 3 positive sales contribution from acquisitions and the benefit of higher transaction values associated with 1 price inflation for the year sales for electricalelectronic decreased by 5 in the first quarter 4 in the second quarter and 5 in the third quarter and were up 6 in the fourth quarter despite the slow market conditions for this segment in 2013 we expect the electricalelectronic business to benefit from its internal growth initiatives a gradually improving manufacturing environment and the incremental revenue from their recently completed acquisitions in the periods ahead 

  

index to financial statements net sales for electricalelectronic increased to 583 million in 2012 up 45 from 2011 the increase in revenues is due primarily to acquisitions which contributed approximately 8 to our sales growth in 2012 a 25 decrease in sales volume and a 1 negative impact from copper pricing for the year served to offset this increase sales for electricalelectronic increased by 5 in the first quarter and were up 9 in the second quarter up 5 in the third quarter and were down 2 in the fourth quarter 

cost of goods sold 

the company includes in cost of goods sold the actual cost of merchandise which represents the vast majority of this line item other costs in cost of goods sold include warranty costs and inbound freight from the supplier net of any vendor allowances and incentives cost of goods sold was 99 billion 92 billion and 89 billion in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the 7 increase in cost of goods sold in 2013 from 2012 is directly related to the sales increase for the same period as product inflation was relatively insignificant and actual costs were relatively unchanged from the prior year cost of goods sold represented 700 of net sales in 2013 710  of net sales in 2012 and 711 of net sales in 2011 the 100 basis point decrease in cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales in 2013 primarily reflects the positive gross margin impact of the 100 company owned store model at gpc asia pacific other changes in cost of goods sold including the slight decrease in 2012 from 2011 reflect our gross margin initiatives to enhance our pricing strategies promote and sell higher margin products and minimize material acquisition costs 

in 2013 the industrial electricalelectronic and office business segments experienced slight vendor price increases in 2012 only the industrial and office business segments experienced vendor price increases in 2011 all four of our business segments experienced vendor price increases in any year where we experience price increases we are able to work with our customers to pass most of these along to them 

operating expenses 

the company includes in selling administrative and other expenses “sga” all personnel and personnel related costs at its headquarters distribution centers and stores which accounts for approximately 65 of total sga additional costs in sga include our facilities delivery marketing advertising legal and professional costs 

sga increased by 371 million or approximately 14 to 30 billion in 2013 representing 214 of net sales which compares to 204 of net sales in 2012 primarily the increase in sga expenses as a percentage of net sales from the prior year is due to the 100 company owned store model at gpc asia pacific which serves to increase both gross profit and sga expenses additionally we experienced decreased expense leverage in 2013 associated with the weak sales environment in our nonautomotive businesses throughout the year these items were partially offset by a 54 million onetime gain net of other expense adjustments recorded to sga in the second quarter of 2013 as a purchase accounting adjustment associated with the april 1 2013 acquisition of gpc asia pacific our management teams remain focused on properly managing the company’s expenses and continuing to assess the appropriate cost structure in our businesses depreciation and amortization expense was 134 million in 2013 an increase of 36 million or 36 from 2012 this increase primarily relates to the depreciation for higher levels of capital expenditures and the amortization associated with acquisitions during the year the provision for doubtful accounts was 9 million in 2013 an increase from 8 million in 2012 we believe the company is adequately reserved for bad debts at december 31 2013 

sga increased by 54 million or approximately 2 to 26 billion in 2012 representing 204 of net sales and down from 208 of net sales in 2011 sga expenses as a percentage of net sales improved from the prior year due to slightly greater expense leverage associated with our sales growth combined with management’s ongoing cost control measures in areas such as personnel freight fleet and logistics excluding acquisitions the company’s headcount at december 31 2012 decreased by approximately 1 from 2011 these expense initiatives have served to further improve the company’s cost structure depreciation and amortization expense was 98 million in 2012 an increase of 9 million or 11 from 2011 this increase primarily relates to the amortization associated with acquisitions during the year the provision for doubtful accounts was 8 million in 2012 down 5 million or 40 from 13 million in 2011 

  

index to financial statements total sharebased compensation expense for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 was 126 million 107 million and 75 million respectively refer to note 5 of the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding sharebased compensation 

nonoperating expenses and income 

nonoperating expenses consist primarily of interest interest expense was 27 million in 2013 20 million in 2012 and 27 million in 2011 the 7 million increase in interest expense in 2013 is due to higher debt levels incurred for the gpc asia pacific acquisition in november 2013 the company renewed certain debt at a favorable interest rate and although the renewal did not materially reduce interest expense in 2013 the new interest rate will save approximately 4 million in annual interest expense beginning in 2014 in 2012 the company benefited from an improved interest rate on certain longterm debt effective november 2011 which reduced interest expense by 7 million from the prior year 

in “other” the net benefit of interest income equity method investment income and noncontrolling interests in 2013 was 13 million a decrease of 3 million from 2012 these items had increased to 16 million in 2012 up approximately 8 million from 2011 this increase reflects the company’s equity income recorded in 2012 for its 30 investment interest in gpc asia pacific 

income before income taxes 

income before income taxes was 10 billion in 2013 an increase of 25 from 2012 as a percentage of net sales income before income taxes was 74 in 2013 compared to 78 in 2012 in 2012 income before income taxes of 10 billion was up 14 from 891 million in 2011 and as a percentage of net sales was 78 an increase from 71 in 2011 

automotive group 

automotive income before income taxes as a percentage of net sales which we refer to as operating margin was steady with the prior year at 86 the changes in gross profit and operating costs as a percentage of net sales which related primarily to the acquisition of gpc asia pacific were relatively neutral to operating profit during the year looking forward automotive’s initiatives to grow sales and control costs are intended to improve its operating margin in the years ahead 

automotive’s operating margin increased to 86 in 2012 from 77 in 2011 the improvement in operating margin for 2012 is attributed primarily to effective cost controls and cost reductions implemented during the year a slight increase in gross margin also positively impacted the operating margin 

industrial group 

industrial’s operating margin decreased to 72 in 2013 from 79 in 2012 the decrease in operating margin in 2013 is due to the combination of reduced expense leverage associated with the slight decrease in sales relative to the prior year and the decline in volume incentives for the year these items were partially offset by effective cost control measures industrial has made several recent acquisitions which will positively impact this segment and will continue to focus on its many sales initiatives and cost controls to further improve its operating margin in the years ahead 

industrial’s operating margin decreased to 79 in 2012 from 81 in 2011 the decrease in operating margin in 2012 is due to the combination of reduced expense leverage associated with slower sales growth relative to the prior year and the decline in volume incentives for the year these items were partially offset by effective cost control measures 

office group 

office’s operating margin decreased to 75 in 2013 from 80 in 2012 primarily related to the reduced expense leverage associated with the decrease in sales for this segment relative to 2012 previously the operating margin at office was relatively steady over the last few years at 80 in 2012 and 79 in 2011 in each of these 

  

index to financial statements periods the cost savings measures in the office segment were somewhat offset by the ongoing gross margin pressures associated with the slow demand for office products across the industry office will continue to focus on its sales initiatives and cost controls to further improve its operating margin in the years ahead 

electricalelectronic group 

electricalelectronic’s operating margin decreased to 84 in 2013 from 87 in 2012 the slight decline in operating margin is primarily due loss of expense leverage associated with the sales decrease for this segment in 2013 relative to 2012 electricalelectronic will continue to focus on its sales initiatives and cost controls to improve its operating margin in the years ahead 

electricalelectronic’s operating margin increased to 87 in 2012 from 73 in 2011 the increase in operating margin in 2012 is primarily due to the positive impact of effective cost management as well as an improved gross margin the improvement in gross margin reflects several factors including higher margin business associated with recent acquisitions and the decrease in copper prices during the year which generally do not affect profit dollars but positively impact margins as the standard industry practice is to bill copper to the customer at cost 

income taxes 

the effective income tax rate of 344 in 2013 was down from 364 in 2012 the decrease reflects the favorable impact of a lower australian tax rate applied to the pretax earnings of gpc asia pacific as well as the favorable tax rate applied to the onetime acquisition gain recorded in the second quarter of 2013 the income tax rate of 364 in 2012 was down slightly from 366 in 2011 primarily due to the favorable impact of a retirement asset valuation adjustment in 2012 relative to 2011 

net income 

net income was 685 million in 2013 an increase of 6 from 648 million in 2012 on a per share diluted basis net income was 440 in 2013 compared to 414 in 2012 up 6 net income in 2013 was 49 of net sales compared to 50 of net sales in 2012

in december 2012 the company’s us defined benefit plan was amended to reflect a hard freeze as of december 31 2013 the company recorded a onetime noncash curtailment gain of 235 million or 010 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2012 in connection with this amendment 

financial condition 

our cash balance of 197 million at december 31 2013 reflects a decrease of 51 compared to our cash balance of 403 million at december 31 2012 in 2013 record levels of cash from operations provided by the increase in net income and ongoing working capital management was offset by approximately 712 million used for the acquisition of businesses and other investing activities the company’s accounts receivable balance at december 31 2013 increased by approximately 12 from the prior year which is less than the company’s 13 sales increase for the fourth quarter of 2013 inventory at december 31 2013 was up by approximately 13 from december 31 2012 which is primarily attributable to acquisitions excluding acquisitions inventory was up by approximately 1 from the prior year accounts payable increased 588 million or approximately 35 from december 31 2012 due primarily to improved payment terms with certain suppliers and the impact of the gpc asia pacific acquisition goodwill and other intangible assets increased by 492 million and 300 respectively from december 31 2012 due to the company’s acquisitions during the year primarily gpc asia pacific the change in our december 31 2013 balances for deferred tax assets down 182 million and pension 

  

index to financial statements and other postretirement benefits liabilities down 433 million from december 31 2012 is primarily due to a change in funded status of the company’s pension plans in 2013 finally the change in our december 31 2013 balance for other assets down 241 million or 38 is primarily due to the purchase of the remaining 70 interest in gpc asia pacific in 2013 previously the company accounted for the 30 investment under the equity method of accounting which was included in other assets in 2012 

liquidity and capital resources 

the company’s sources of capital consist primarily of cash flows from operations supplemented as necessary by private issuances of debt and bank borrowings we have 765 million of total debt outstanding at december 31 2013 of which 250 million matures in november 2016 and 250 million matures in december 2023 in addition the company entered into a syndicated facility agreement the “syndicated facility” for 850 million in september 2012 which replaced the 350 million unsecured revolving line of credit that was scheduled to mature in december 2012 265 million was outstanding under the syndicated facility or line of credit at december 31 2013 and no amount was outstanding at december 31 2012 currently we believe that our cash on hand and available shortterm and longterm sources of capital are sufficient to fund the company’s operations including working capital requirements scheduled debt payments interest payments capital expenditures benefit plan contributions income tax obligations dividends share repurchases and contemplated acquisitions 

the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 16 to 1 at december 31 2013 and this compares to 19 to 1 at december 31 2012 our liquidity position remains solid the company’s total debt outstanding at december 31 2013 is up 265 million or 53 from december 31 2012 and primarily relates to the incremental borrowings utilized for the gpc asia pacific acquisition

notes and other borrowings 

the company maintains an 850 million unsecured revolving line of credit with a consortium of financial institutions which matures in september 2017 and bears interest at libor plus a margin which is based on the company’s leverage ratio 092 at december 31 2013 the company also has the option under this agreement to increase its borrowing an additional 350 million as well as an option to decrease the borrowing capacity or terminate the syndicated facility with appropriate notice at december 31 2013 approximately 265 million was outstanding under this line of credit no amounts were outstanding under this line of credit at december 31 2012 due to the workers’ compensation and insurance reserve requirements in certain states the company also had unused letters of credit of approximately 62 million and 61 million outstanding at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively

contractual and other obligations 

the following table shows the company’s approximate obligations and commitments including interest due on credit facilities to make future payments under specified contractual obligations as of december 31 2013 

contractual obligations 

 

 due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with the company’s unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2013 the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of 

  

index to financial statements cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities therefore 60 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above refer to note 6 of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes 

purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in our estimates we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements our purchase orders are based on our current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons the company does not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements 

the company guarantees the borrowings of certain independently owned automotive parts stores independents and certain other affiliates in which the company has a noncontrolling equity ownership interest affiliates the company’s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these independents and affiliates is generally equal to the total borrowings subject to the company’s guarantee to date the company has had no significant losses in connection with guarantees of independents’ and affiliates’ borrowings the following table shows the company’s approximate commercial commitments as of december 31 2013 

other commercial commitments 

 

 in addition the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans that may obligate us to make contributions to the plans from time to time contributions in 2013 were 74 million we expect to make a 51 million cash contribution to our qualified defined benefit plans in 2014 and contributions required for 2014 and future years will depend on a number of unpredictable factors including the market performance of the plans’ assets and future changes in interest rates that affect the actuarial measurement of the plans’ obligations 

share repurchases 

in 2013 the company repurchased approximately 15 million shares and the company had remaining authority to purchase approximately 107 million shares at december 31 2013 

critical accounting policies 

general 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we describe in this section certain critical accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates assumptions and judgments an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to 

  

index to financial statements be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially impact the consolidated financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for further information on the critical accounting policies see note 1 of the consolidated financial statements

the company identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates appropriate loss provisions related thereto historically these loss provisions have not been significant as the vast majority of the company’s inventories are not highly susceptible to obsolescence and are eligible for return under various vendor return programs while the company has no reason to believe its inventory return privileges will be discontinued in the future its risk of loss associated with obsolete or slow moving inventories would increase if such were to occur 

allowance for doubtful accounts — methodology 

the company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors the company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on historical bad debt experience and periodically adjusts this estimate when the company becomes aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations eg bankruptcy filing or as a result of changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable while the company has a large customer base that is geographically dispersed a general economic downturn in any of the industry segments in which the company operates could result in higher than expected defaults and therefore the need to revise estimates for bad debts for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 the company recorded provisions for doubtful accounts of 87 million 80 million and 132 million respectively 

consideration received from vendors 

the company enters into agreements at the beginning of each year with many of its vendors that provide for inventory purchase incentives generally the company earns inventory purchase incentives upon achieving specified volume purchasing levels or other criteria the company accrues for the receipt of these incentives as part of its inventory cost based on cumulative purchases of inventory to date and projected inventory purchases through the end of the year while management believes the company will continue to receive consideration from vendors in 2014 and beyond there can be no assurance that vendors will continue to provide comparable amounts of incentives in the future or that we will be able to achieve the specified volumes necessary to take advantage of such incentives 

impairment of property plant and equipment and goodwill and other intangible assets 

at least annually the company evaluates property plant and equipment goodwill and other intangible assets for potential impairment indicators the company’s judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance among other factors future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired evaluating for impairment also requires the company to estimate future operating results and cash flows which require judgment by management any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

employee benefit plans 

the company’s benefit plan committees in the us and canada establish investment policies and strategies and regularly monitor the performance of the company’s pension plan assets the pension plan investment strategy implemented by the company’s management is to achieve longterm objectives and invest the pension assets in accordance with the applicable pension legislation in the us and canada as well as fiduciary standards the longterm primary objectives for the pension plan funds are to provide for a reasonable amount of longterm growth of capital without undue exposure to risk protect the assets from erosion of purchasing power and pro 

  

index to financial statements vide investment results that meet or exceed the pension plan’s actuarially assumed long term rate of return the company’s investment strategy with respect to pension plan assets is to generate a return in excess of the passive portfolio benchmark 49 sp 500 index 5 russell mid cap index 8 russell 2000 index 5 msci eafe index 5 dj global moderate index and 28 barcap us govtcredit 

we make several critical assumptions in determining our pension plan assets and liabilities and related pension expense we believe the most critical of these assumptions are the expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate other assumptions we make relate to employee demographic factors such as rate of compensation increases mortality rates retirement patterns and turnover rates 

based on the investment policy for the pension plans as well as an asset study that was performed based on the company’s asset allocations and future expectations the company’s expected rate of return on plan assets for measuring 2014 pension expense or income is 785 for the plans the asset study forecasted expected rates of return for the approximate duration of the company’s benefit obligations using capital market data and historical relationships 

the discount rate is chosen as the rate at which pension obligations could be effectively settled and is based on capital market conditions as of the measurement date we have matched the timing and duration of the expected cash flows of our pension obligations to a yield curve generated from a broad portfolio of highquality fixed income debt instruments to select our discount rate based upon this cash flow matching analysis we selected a weighted average discount rate for the plans of 510 at december 31 2013 

net periodic benefit cost for our defined benefit pension plans was 511 million 268 million and 323 million for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the increase in pension cost in 2013 from 2012 was primarily due to the curtailment gain recorded in connection with the 2012 amendment to the us defined benefit pension plan such curtailment gain net of the change in assumptions for the rate of return on plan assets and discount rate also accounts for the decrease in pension cost in 2012 from 2011 the 2012 amendment and related curtailment decreased benefit costs in 2012 and are discussed further below refer to note 7 of the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding employee benefit plans 

in december 2012 the company’s us defined benefit plan was amended to reflect a hard freeze as of december 31 2013 no further benefits were provided after this date for additional credited service or earnings and all participants became fully vested as of december 31 2013 the company recorded a 235 million noncash curtailment gain in december 2012 in connection with this amendment

index to financial statements we recorded the quarterly earnings per share amounts as if each quarter was a discrete period as a result the sum of the basic and diluted earnings per share will not necessarily total the annual basic and diluted earnings per share 

the preparation of interim consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the amounts reported in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements specifically the company makes estimates and assumptions in its interim consolidated financial statements for the accrual of bad debts inventory adjustments including adjustments for a majority of inventories that are valued under the lastin firstout “lifo” method customer sales returns and volume incentives earned among others bad debts are accrued based on a percentage of sales and volume incentives are estimated based upon cumulative and projected purchasing levels inventory adjustments are accrued on an interim basis and adjusted in the fourth quarter based on the annual booktophysical inventory adjustment and lifo valuation the methodology and practices used in deriving estimates and assumptions for interim reporting typically result in adjustments upon accurate determination at yearend the effect of these adjustments in 2013 and 2012 was not significant

foreign currency 

the company has translation gains or losses that result from translation of the results of operations of an operating unit’s foreign functional currency into us dollars for consolidated financial statement purposes the company’s principal foreign currency exchange exposure is the canadian dollar the functional currency of our canadian operations and the australian dollar the functional currency of our australasian operations foreign currency exchange exposure particularly in regard to the canadian and australian dollar and to a lesser extent the mexican peso negatively impacted our results for the year ended december 31 2013 

during 2013 and 2012 it was estimated that a 10 shift in exchange rates between those foreign functional currencies and the us dollar would have impacted translated net sales by approximately 255 million and 176 million respectively

forwardlooking statements are only as of the date they are made and the company undertakes no duty to update its forwardlooking statements except as required by law you are advised however to review any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our subsequent forms 10q 8k and other reports to the sec 

set forth below are the material risks and uncertainties that if they were to occur could materially and adversely affect our business or could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements in this report and in the other public statements we make please be aware that these risks may change over time and other risks may prove to be important in the future new risks may emerge at any time and we cannot predict such risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our business financial condition results of operations or the trading price of our securities 

our business will be adversely affected if demand for our products slows 

our business depends on customer demand for the products that we distribute demand for these products depends on many factors 

with respect to our automotive group the primary factors are 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 with respect to our industrial parts group the primary factors are 

 

  

  

   

 with respect to our office products group the primary factors are 

 

  

 with respect to our electricalelectronic materials group the primary factors are 

 

  

 uncertainty andor deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions including unemployment inflation or deflation high energy costs uncertain credit markets or other economic conditions could have a negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our business and operating results may in the future be adversely affected by uncertain global economic conditions including instability in credit markets declining consumer and business confidence fluctuating commodity prices volatile exchange rates and other challenges that could affect the global economy both our commercial and retail customers may experience deterioration of their financial resources which could result in existing or potential customers delaying or canceling plans to purchase our products our vendors could experience similar conditions which could impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us future weakness in the global economy could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows in future periods 

we depend on our relationships with our vendors and a disruption of our vendor relationships or a disruption in our vendors’ operations could harm our business 

as a distributor of automotive parts industrial parts office products and electricalelectronic materials our business depends on developing and maintaining close and productive relationships with our vendors we depend on our vendors to sell us quality products at favorable prices many factors outside our control including without limitation raw material shortages inadequate manufacturing capacity labor disputes transportation disruptions or weather conditions could adversely affect our vendors’ ability to deliver to us quality merchandise at favorable prices in a timely manner furthermore financial or operational difficulties with a particular vendor could cause that vendor to increase the cost of the products or decrease the quality of the products we purchase from it vendor consolidation could also limit the number of suppliers from which we may purchase products and could materially affect the prices we pay for these products in our automotive business the number of vendors could decrease considerably and the prices charged to us by the remaining vendors could increase to the extent that vehicle production slows due to a decline in consumer spending and possibly the failure of one or more of the large automobile manufacturers we would suffer an adverse impact if our vendors limit or cancel the return privileges that currently protect us from inventory obsolescence 

we face substantial competition in the industries in which we do business 

the sale of automotive and industrial parts office products and electrical materials is highly competitive and impacted by many factors including name recognition product availability customer service anticipating changing customer preferences store location and pricing pressures because we seek to offer competitive prices if our competitors reduce their prices we may be forced to reduce our prices which could result in a material decline in our revenues and earnings increased competition among distributors of automotive and industrial parts office products and electronic materials including internetrelated initiatives could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations the company anticipates no decline in competition in any of its four business segments in the foreseeable future 

  

in particular the market for replacement automotive parts is highly competitive and subjects us to a wide variety of competitors we compete primarily with national and regional auto parts chains independently owned regional and local automotive parts and accessories stores automobile dealers that supply manufacturer replacement parts and accessories mass merchandisers and wholesale clubs that sell automotive products and regional and local full service automotive repair shops furthermore the automotive aftermarket has experienced consolidation in recent years consolidation among our competitors could further enhance their financial position provide them with the ability to provide more competitive prices to customers for whom we compete and allow them to achieve increased efficiencies in their consolidated operations that enable them to more effectively compete for customers if we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies or if our competitors develop more effective strategies we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

we may not be able to successfully implement our business initiatives in each of our four business segments to grow our sales and earnings which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have implemented numerous initiatives in each of our four business segments to grow sales and earnings including the introduction of new and expanded product lines geographic expansion including acquisitions sales to new markets enhanced customer marketing programs and a variety of gross margin and cost savings initiatives if we are unable to implement these initiatives efficiently and effectively or if these initiatives are unsuccessful our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

successful implementation of these initiatives also depends on factors specific to the automotive parts industry and the other industries in which we operate and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control in addition to the other risk factors contained in this “item 1a risk factors” adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our business initiatives and have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 because we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees and other costs 

we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers employees or other third parties for various actions the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim this could have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

additionally we are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to environmental protection product quality standards building and zoning requirements as well as employment law matters if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs in addition our capital expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations

 item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  tableend overview 

genuine parts company is a service organization engaged in the distribution of automotive parts industrial parts office products and electricalelectronic materials we have a long tradition of growth dating back to 1928 the year we were founded in atlanta georgia in 2012 the company conducted business throughout the united states canada mexico and puerto rico from approximately 2000 locations 

we recorded consolidated net sales of 130 billion for the year ended december 31 2012 an increase of 45 compared to 125 billion in 2011 consolidated net income for the year ended december 31 2012 was 648 million up 15 from 565 million in 2011 the company’s internal growth initiatives and effective cost management which we discuss further below served to drive our solid financial performance for the year despite the slowing industry trends across our businesses as the year progressed 

the 45 sales growth in 2012 follows an 11 increase in revenues in both 2010 and 2011 our 15 increase in net income follows a 19 increase in net income in 2010 and 2011 throughout the two year period preceding 2012 we experienced strong and steady growth in three of our four business segments as conditions in these industries improved significantly from the depressed levels experienced in 2009 these favorable conditions began to moderate following the first quarter of 2012 which created a more challenging sales environment over the balance of the year over the three year period of 2010 through 2012 our financial performance was also positively impacted by a variety of initiatives we implemented to grow sales and earnings in each of our four businesses examples of such initiatives include strategic acquisitions the introduction of new and expanded 

  

product lines geographic expansion sales to new markets enhanced customer marketing programs and a variety of gross margin and cost savings initiatives we discuss these initiatives further below 

with regard to the december 31 2012 consolidated balance sheet the company’s cash balance of 403 million was down from cash of 525 million at december 31 2011 due primarily to two investments in our automotive business during 2012 which are discussed further under liquidity and capital resources the company’s strong cash position was supported by the increase in net income and ongoing working capital management in 2012 accounts receivable increased by approximately 2 which is below our sales increase in the fourth quarter of the year and inventory was up by just under 7 primarily from acquisitions accounts payable increased 241 million or 17 from the prior year the significant increase in this line item is due primarily to improved payment terms with certain suppliers total debt outstanding at december 31 2012 was unchanged from 500 million at december 31 2011 

results of operations 

our results of operations are summarized below for the three years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 

 

 net sales 

consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31 2012 totaled 130 billion a 45 increase from 2011 and driven by sales increases in three of our four business segments acquisitions in our automotive and electrical businesses contributed 2 to our sales growth and increased sales volume added approximately 2 to sales the impact of product inflation varied by business as cumulatively prices in 2012 were flat in the automotive segment up approximately 2 in the industrial segment flat in the electrical segment and up approximately 3 in the office segment the company is well positioned to improve sales again in 2013 

consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31 2011 totaled 125 billion an 11 increase from 2010 the company showed sales growth in all four of our business segments in 2011 the increase in total sales volume for the year added approximately 9 to sales while acquisitions and the effect of currency associated with our canadian and mexican businesses each contributed 1 as well cumulatively prices in 2011 were up approximately 3 in the automotive segment up approximately 4 in the industrial segment up approximately 5 in the electrical segment and up approximately 2 in the office segment 

automotive group 

net sales for the automotive group “automotive” were 63 billion in 2012 an increase of 4 from 2011 the increase in sales for the year was primarily due to the may 1 2012 acquisition of quaker city motor parts co “quaker city” which contributed approximately 3 to sales additionally automotive achieved a positive comparable store sales increase of slightly more than 1 automotive sales were not materially impacted by product inflation or the effect of currency associated with our canadian and mexican businesses in 2012 automotive revenues were up 6 in the first quarter then up 4 in the second quarter up 25 in the third quarter and up 5 in the fourth quarter we believe that the underlying fundamentals in the automotive aftermarket including the overall aging of the vehicle populations remain solid and will serve to drive increased demand for automotive aftermarket maintenance and supply items in 2013 based on these fundamentals and the internal growth initiatives in our automotive business we expect to grow our sales for this group again in 2013 

  

net sales for automotive were 61 billion in 2011 an increase of 8 from 2010 sales improved in 2011 due primarily to positive comparable stores sales growth of approximately 6 other factors impacting our automotive sales for the year include higher transaction value associated with product inflation which contributed approximately 1 and the effect of currency associated with our canadian and mexican businesses which positively impacted sales by approximately 1 automotive revenues were up 9 in the first second and third quarters and were up 6 in the fourth quarter 

industrial group 

net sales for motion industries our industrial group “industrial” were 45 billion in 2012 an increase of 7 compared to 2011 the positive impact of their internal sales initiatives which drove higher sales volume contributed 5 to sales higher transaction values in 2012 associated with product inflation added another 2 to sales there was no material impact on sales from acquisitions and no effect of currency associated with our canadian business as in the prior year the relative steadiness in the manufacturing sector of the economy served by industrial was evidenced by sustained levels of manufacturing industrial production and capacity utilization for the year overall which this group tends to track these indices did however show some slowing over the second half of 2012 relative to the first half consistent with this trend industrial revenues were up 12 in the first quarter of 2012 up 8 in the second quarter then up 45 and 2 in the third and fourth quarters respectively we anticipate a stable manufacturing environment in the near term and this will provide us opportunities to grow our industrial business in 2013 

net sales for industrial were 42 billion in 2011 an increase of 19 compared to 2010 factors contributing to the sales increase for this group include the positive impact of their internal sales initiatives which drove sales volumes up approximately 11 also in 2011 sales were positively impacted by higher transaction values associated with product inflation of approximately 4 acquisitions which accounted for approximately 3 of industrial’s sales growth for the year and the effect of currency associated with our canadian business which positively impacted sales by less than 1 industrial revenues were up 24 in the first quarter of 2011 up 19 in the second quarter then up 18 and 13 in the third and fourth quarters respectively 

office group 

net sales for s p richards our office products group “office” were 17 billion in 2012 flat with revenues in 2011 the industrywide slowdown in office products consumption which continues to pressure this segment reflects the ongoing elevated levels of white collar unemployment which the industry tends to track in addition other industry trends such as the declining demand for paper and paper based office products are negatively impacting the office products industry overall sales volume in office declined by 3 for the year offset by higher transaction values associated with price inflation of approximately 3 sales decreased by 1 in the first second and third quarters and were up 3 in the fourth quarter of 2012 we expect to improve our sales volumes in 2013 as the economy recovers further and white collar unemployment declines 

net sales for office were 17 billion in 2011 up 3 from 2010 office revenues began to stabilize in 2010 relative to prior year trends and this group was able to make further progress in 2011 higher transaction values due to product inflation of approximately 2 contributed to our sales growth we were also pleased to report a 1 increase in sales volume for this business despite the ongoing difficult environment for the office products industry which we attribute to the generally slow recovery of white collar employment levels in the us sales increased approximately 5 4 and 3 in the first second and third quarters respectively and were down 1 in the fourth quarter of 2011 

electrical group 

net sales for eis our electrical and electronic group “electrical” increased to 583 million in 2012 up 45 from 2011 the increase in revenues is due primarily to acquisitions which contributed approximately 8 to our sales growth in 2012 a 25 decrease in sales volume and a 1 negative impact from copper pricing for the year served to offset this increase electrical’s customer base experienced slightly weaker manufacturing 

  

expansion during the year as measured by the institute for supply management’s purchasing managers index sales for electrical increased by 5 in the first quarter and were up 9 in the second quarter up 5 in the third quarter and were down 2 in the fourth quarter based on the underlying assumption for stronger manufacturing expansion in 2013 the company currently anticipates another year of reasonable growth in the electrical business 

net sales for electrical increased to 558 million in 2011 up 24 from 2010 acquisitions contributed approximately 11 to electrical’s sales growth and the effect of copper pricing had a 3 positive sales impact for the year the increase in sales volume supported by continued manufacturing expansion during the year contributed 5 to sales in 2011 and product inflation which resulted in higher transaction values added another 5 to sales electrical sales increased by 39 in the first quarter followed by increases of 28 in the second quarter 22 in the third quarter and 10 in the fourth quarter 

cost of goods sold 

the company includes in cost of goods sold the actual cost of merchandise which represents the vast majority of this line item other costs in cost of goods sold include warranty costs and inbound freight from the supplier net of any vendor allowances and incentives cost of goods sold was 92 billion 89 billion and 80 billion in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the 4 increase in cost of goods sold from 2011 to 2012 is directly related to the sales increase for the same period as actual costs remained steady cost of goods sold represented 710 of net sales in 2012 711  of net sales in 2011 and 710 of net sales in 2010 the slight decrease in cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales for 2012 reflects our gross margin initiatives to enhance our pricing strategies promote and sell higher margin products and minimize material acquisition costs in 2011 these initiatives were offset by the negative impact of certain pricing adjustments implemented in automotive as well as ongoing competitive pricing pressures in the industrial and office businesses hence the lower gross margin level in 2011 when compared to 2010 

in 2012 only the industrial and office business segments experienced vendor price increases in the previous two years all four of our business segments experienced vendor price increases although in 2010 the automotive and office increases were relatively immaterial in any year where we experience price increases we are able to work with our customers to pass most of these along to them 

operating expenses 

the company includes in selling administrative and other expenses “sga” all personnel and personnel related costs at its headquarters distribution centers and stores which accounts for approximately 60 of total sga additional costs in sga include our facility delivery marketing advertising legal and professional costs sga increased by 54 million or approximately 2 to 26 billion in 2012 representing 204 of net sales and down from 208 of net sales in 2011 sga expenses as a percentage of net sales improved from the prior year due to slightly greater expense leverage associated with our sales growth combined with management’s ongoing cost control measures in areas such as personnel freight fleet and logistics excluding acquisitions the company’s headcount at december 31 2012 decreased by approximately 1 from 2011 these expense initiatives have served to further improve the company’s cost structure our management teams remain focused on properly managing the company’s expenses and continuing to assess the appropriate cost structure in our businesses depreciation and amortization expense was 98 million in 2012 an increase of 9 million or 11 from 2011 this increase primarily relates to the amortization associated with acquisitions during the year the provision for doubtful accounts was 8 million in 2012 down 5 million or 40 from 13 million in 2011 we believe the company is adequately reserved for bad debts at december 31 2012 

sga increased by 228 million or 10 to 26 billion in 2011 representing 208 of net sales and down from 211 of net sales in 2010 sga expenses as a percentage of net sales improved from the prior year due primarily to the benefit of greater expense leverage associated with the second consecutive 11 sales increase for the year in addition management’s ongoing cost control measures served to further improve the company’s cost structure after reducing the size of its workforce by approximately 12 during 2008 and 2009 the company has only added back approximately 2 of that over the two year period of 2011 and 2010 including 

  

acquisitions depreciation and amortization expense in 2011 was 89 million relatively inline with 2010 the provision for doubtful accounts was 13 million in 2011 up nearly 3 million or 25 from 11 million in 2010 the increase in bad debt expense was primarily a function of the increase in sales for the year and not due to collections issues 

total sharebased compensation expense for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 was 107 million 75 million and 70 million respectively refer to note 5 of the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding sharebased compensation 

nonoperating expenses and income 

nonoperating expenses consist primarily of interest interest expense was 20 million in 2012 27 million in 2011 and 28 million in 2010 the declining trend in interest expense over the past two years is the result of an improved interest rate on certain longterm debt effective november 2011 

in “other” interest income and noncontrolling interests in 2012 increased by approximately 8 million from 2011 this increase reflects the company’s equity income recorded in 2012 for its 30 investment interest in exego 

income before income taxes 

income before income taxes was 10 billion in 2012 an increase of 14 from 891 million in 2011 as a percentage of net sales income before income taxes was 78 in 2012 reflecting an increase from 71 in 2011 in 2011 income before income taxes of 891 million was up 17 from 762 million in 2010 and as a percentage of net sales was 71 an increase from 68 in 2010 

automotive group 

automotive income before income taxes as a percentage of net sales which we refer to as operating margin increased to 86 in 2012 from 77 in 2011 the improvement in operating margin for 2012 is attributed primarily to effective cost controls and cost reductions implemented during the year a slight increase in gross margin also positively impacted their operating margin automotive’s initiatives to grow sales and control costs are intended to further improve its operating margin in the years ahead 

automotive’s operating margin increased to 77 in 2011 from 75 in 2010 the improvement in operating margin for 2011 is attributed to the benefit of greater expense leverage associated with automotive’s 8 sales increase for the year

industrial’s operating margin decreased to 79 in 2012 from 81 in 2011 the decrease in operating margin in 2012 is due to the combination of reduced expense leverage associated with slower sales growth relative to the prior year and the decline in volume incentives for the year these items were partially offset by effective cost control measures industrial will continue to focus on its sales initiatives and cost controls to further improve its operating margin in the years ahead 

industrial’s operating margin increased to 81 in 2011 from 73 in 2010 the increase in operating margin in 2011 was due to the combination of greater expense leverage associated with a 19 sales increase cost savings and increased volume incentives 

office group 

office’s operating margin has been relatively steady over the last three years at 80 in 2012 79 in 2011 and 80 in 2010 in each of these three periods the cost savings measures in the office segment were somewhat offset by the ongoing gross margin pressures associated with the slow demand for office products across the industry office will continue to focus on its sales initiatives and cost controls to further improve its operating margin in the years ahead 

  

electrical group 

electrical’s operating margin increased to 87 in 2012 from 73 in 2011 the increase in operating margin in 2012 is primarily due to the positive impact of effective cost management as well as an improved gross margin the improvement in gross margin reflects several factors including higher margin business associated with recent acquisitions and the decrease in copper prices during the year which generally do not affect profit dollars but positively impact margins as the standard industry practice is to bill copper to the customer at cost electrical will continue to focus on its sales initiatives and cost controls to further improve its operating margin in the years ahead 

electrical’s operating margin increased to 73 in 2011 from 69 in 2010 the increase in operating margin was due to the combination of greater expense leverage associated with a 24 sales increase and the ongoing benefits of effective cost controls the improvement in these areas was partially offset by the increase in copper prices during the year which negatively impacted margins 

income taxes 

the effective income tax rate of 364 in 2012 was down slightly from 366 in 2011 primarily due to the favorable impact of a retirement asset valuation adjustment in 2012 relative to 2011 the income tax rate decreased to 366 in 2011 from 376 in 2010 the decrease from 2010 is primarily attributable to a favorable adjustment recorded in the first quarter of 2011 associated with the statute of limitations related to international taxes 

net income 

net income was 648 million in 2012 an increase of 15 from 565 million in 2011 on a per share diluted basis net income was 414 in 2012 compared to 358 in 2011 up 16 net income in 2012 was 50 of net sales compared to 45 of net sales in 2011 

in december 2012 the company’s us defined benefit plan was amended to reflect a hard freeze as of december 31 2013 the company recorded a onetime noncash curtailment gain of 235 million in connection with this amendment 

net income was 565 million in 2011 an increase of 19 from 476 million in 2010 on a per share diluted basis net income was 358 in 2011 compared to 300 in 2010 up 19 net income in 2011 was 45 of net sales compared to 42 of net sales in 2010 

financial condition 

our cash balance of 403 million at december 31 2012 was down approximately 122 million from our cash balance at december 31 2011 in 2012 cash provided by the increase in net income and ongoing working capital management was offset by approximately 530 million used for the exego investment and quaker city and light fabrication acquisitions the company’s accounts receivable balance at december 31 2012 increased by approximately 2 from the prior year which is less than the company’s 35 sales increase for the fourth quarter of 2012 inventory at december 31 2012 was up by approximately 7 from december 31 2011 which is primarily attributable to acquisitions excluding acquisitions inventory was up by approximately 2 from the prior year accounts payable increased 241 million or approximately 17 from december 31 2011 due primarily to improved payment terms with certain suppliers goodwill and other intangible assets increased by 218 million or 78 from december 31 2011 due to the company’s acquisitions during the year the change in our december 31 2012 balances for pension and other postretirement benefits liabilities up 79 million or approximately 16 from december 31 2011 is primarily due to a change in funded status of the company’s pension and other postretirement plans in 2012 

liquidity and capital resources 

the company’s sources of capital consist primarily of cash flows from operations supplemented as necessary by private issuances of debt and bank borrowings we have 500 million of total debt outstanding at 

  

december 31 2012 of which 250 million matures in november 2013 and 250 million matures in november 2016 in addition the company entered into a syndicated facility agreement the “syndicated facility” for 850 million in september 2012 which replaced the 350 million unsecured revolving line of credit that was scheduled to mature in december 2012 no amounts were outstanding under the syndicated facility or line of credit at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively the capital and credit markets were volatile over the last few years although these conditions did not materially impact our access to these markets currently we believe that our cash on hand and available shortterm and longterm sources of capital are sufficient to fund the company’s operations including working capital requirements scheduled debt payments interest payments capital expenditures benefit plan contributions income tax obligations dividends share repurchases and contemplated acquisitions 

the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 19 to 1 at december 31 2012 and before consideration of current debt outstanding at december 31 2012 the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 22 to 1 this compares to 24 to 1 at december 31 2011 our liquidity position remains solid the company’s 500 million in total debt outstanding at december 31 2012 is unchanged from 2011 

sources and uses of net cash 

a summary of the company’s consolidated statements of cash flows is as follows 

 

 net cash provided by operating activities 

the company continues to generate cash and net cash provided by operating activities totaled 906 million in 2012 this reflects a 45 increase from 2011 as collectively trade accounts receivable merchandise inventories and trade accounts payable represented a 208 million source of cash in 2012 compared to a 19 million use of cash in 2011 additionally net income in 2012 increased by 83 million net cash provided by operating activities was 625 million in 2011 an 8 decrease from 2010 as collectively trade accounts receivable merchandise inventories and trade accounts payable represented a 19 million use of cash in 2011 compared to a 185 million source of cash in 2010 this was offset by a 90 million increase in net income 

net cash used in investing activities 

net cash flow used in investing activities was 652 million in 2012 compared to 231 million in 2011 an increase of 182 cash used for acquisitions of businesses and other investing activities in 2012 was 558 million as previously discussed or 421 million greater than in 2011 capital expenditures of 102 million in 2012 were relatively consistent with 2011 and we estimate that cash used for capital expenditures in 2013 will be approximately 115 to 135 million net cash flow used in investing activities was 231 million in 2011 compared to 172 million in 2010 an increase of 34 cash used for acquisitions of businesses and other investing activities in 2011 was 46 million greater than in 2010 and capital expenditures increased by 18 million for the year 

net cash used in financing activities 

the company used 379 million of cash in financing activities in 2012 down 4 from the 394 million used in financing activities in 2011 cash used in financing activities in 2011was up 74 million or 23 from the 321 million used in 2010 for the three years presented net cash used in financing activities was primarily for dividends paid to shareholders and repurchases of the company’s common stock the company paid dividends 

  

to shareholders of 301 million 276 million and 258 million during 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the company expects this trend of increasing dividends to continue in the foreseeable future during 2012 2011 and 2010 the company repurchased 82 million 122 million and 75 million respectively of the company’s common stock we expect to remain active in our share repurchase program but the amount and value of shares repurchased will vary 

notes and other borrowings 

the company maintains an 850 million unsecured revolving line of credit with a consortium of financial institutions which matures in september 2017 and bears interest at libor plus a margin which is based on the company’s leverage ratio 096 at december 31 2012 the company also has the option under this agreement to increase its borrowing an additional 350 million as well as an option to decrease the borrowing capacity or terminate the syndicated facility with appropriate notice at december 31 2012 and 2011 no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit due to the workers’ compensation and insurance reserve requirements in certain states the company also had unused letters of credit of approximately 61 million and 54 million outstanding at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively 

at december 31 2012 the company had unsecured senior notes outstanding under a 500 million financing arrangement as follows 250 million series c senior unsecured note 467 fixed due 2013 and 250 million series d and e senior unsecured notes 335 fixed due 2016 these borrowings contain covenants related to a maximum debttocapitalization ratio and certain limitations on additional borrowings at december 31 2012 the company was in compliance with all such covenants the weighted average interest rate on the company’s total outstanding borrowings was approximately 401 at december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 total interest expense net of interest income for all borrowings was 196 million 246 million and 266 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

contractual and other obligations 

the following table shows the company’s approximate obligations and commitments including interest due on credit facilities to make future payments under specified contractual obligations as of december 31 2012 

contractual obligations 

 

 due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with the company’s unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2012 the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities therefore 58 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above refer to note 6 of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes 

purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in our estimates we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements our purchase orders are based on our current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons the company does not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements 

  

the company guarantees the borrowings of certain independently owned automotive parts stores independents and certain other affiliates in which the company has a noncontrolling equity ownership interest affiliates the company’s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these independents and affiliates is generally equal to the total borrowings subject to the company’s guarantee to date the company has had no significant losses in connection with guarantees of independents’ and affiliates’ borrowings the following table shows the company’s approximate commercial commitments as of december 31 2012 

other commercial commitments 

 

 in addition the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans that may obligate us to make contributions to the plans from time to time contributions in 2012 were 16 million we expect to make a 70 million cash contribution to our qualified defined benefit plans in 2013 and contributions required for 2013 and future years will depend on a number of unpredictable factors including the market performance of the plans’ assets and future changes in interest rates that affect the actuarial measurement of the plans’ obligations 

share repurchases 

in 2012 the company repurchased approximately 14 million shares and the company had remaining authority to purchase approximately 122 million shares at december 31 2012 

critical accounting policies 

general 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we describe in this section certain critical accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates assumptions and judgments an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially impact the consolidated financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for further information on the critical accounting policies see note 1 of the consolidated financial statements including our revised interpretation relating to accounting for potential sales returns of automotive parts 

  

inventories — provisions for slow moving and obsolescence 

the company identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates appropriate loss provisions related thereto historically these loss provisions have not been significant as the vast majority of the company’s inventories are not highly susceptible to obsolescence and are eligible for return under various vendor return programs while the company has no reason to believe its inventory return privileges will be discontinued in the future its risk of loss associated with obsolete or slow moving inventories would increase if such were to occur 

allowance for doubtful accounts — methodology 

the company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors initially the company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on historical bad debt experience this initial estimate is periodically adjusted when the company becomes aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations eg bankruptcy filing or as a result of changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable while the company has a large customer base that is geographically dispersed a general economic downturn in any of the industry segments in which the company operates could result in higher than expected defaults and therefore the need to revise estimates for bad debts for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 the company recorded provisions for doubtful accounts of 80 million 132 million and 106 million respectively 

consideration received from vendors 

the company enters into agreements at the beginning of each year with many of its vendors that provide for inventory purchase incentives generally the company earns inventory purchase incentives upon achieving specified volume purchasing levels or other criteria the company accrues for the receipt of these incentives as part of its inventory cost based on cumulative purchases of inventory to date and projected inventory purchases through the end of the year while management believes the company will continue to receive consideration from vendors in 2013 and beyond there can be no assurance that vendors will continue to provide comparable amounts of incentives in the future or that we will be able to achieve the specified volumes necessary to take advantage of such incentives 

impairment of property plant and equipment and goodwill and other intangible assets 

at least annually the company evaluates property plant and equipment goodwill and other intangible assets for potential impairment indicators the company’s judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance among other factors future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired evaluating for impairment also requires the company to estimate future operating results and cash flows which require judgment by management any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

employee benefit plans 

the company’s benefit plan committees in the us and canada establish investment policies and strategies and regularly monitor the performance of the company’s pension plan assets the pension plan investment strategy implemented by the company’s management is to achieve longterm objectives and invest the pension assets in accordance with the applicable pension legislation in the us and canada as well as fiduciary standards the longterm primary objectives for the pension plan funds are to provide for a reasonable amount of longterm growth of capital without undue exposure to risk protect the assets from erosion of purchasing power and provide investment results that meet or exceed the pension plan’s actuarially assumed long term rate of return the company’s investment strategy with respect to pension plan assets is to generate a return in excess of the passive portfolio benchmark 49 sp 500 index 5 russell mid cap index 8 russell 2000 index 5 msci eafe index 5 dj global moderate index and 28 barcap us govtcredit 

  

we make several critical assumptions in determining our pension plan liabilities and related pension expense we believe the most critical of these assumptions are the expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate other assumptions we make relate to employee demographic factors such as rate of compensation increases mortality rates retirement patterns and turnover rates 

based on the investment policy for the pension plans as well as an asset study that was performed based on the company’s asset allocations and future expectations the company’s expected rate of return on plan assets for measuring 2013 pension expense or income is 783 for the plans the asset study forecasted expected rates of return for the approximate duration of the company’s benefit obligations using capital market data and historical relationships 

the discount rate is chosen as the rate at which pension obligations could be effectively settled and is based on capital market conditions as of the measurement date we have matched the timing and duration of the expected cash flows of our pension obligations to a yield curve generated from a broad portfolio of highquality fixed income debt instruments to select our discount rate based upon this cash flow matching analysis we selected a weighted average discount rate for the plans of 417 at december 31 2012 

net periodic benefit cost for our defined benefit pension plans was 268 million 323 million and 219 million for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the decrease in pension cost in 2012 from 2011 was primarily due to the curtailment gain recorded in connection with the 2012 amendment to the us defined benefit pension plan offset by the change in assumptions for the rate of return on plan assets and discount rate the increase in pension cost in 2011 from 2010 reflects the change in assumptions for the rate of return on plan assets the discount rate and the rate of compensation increases the 2012 amendment and related curtailment decreased benefit costs in 2012 and are discussed further below refer to note 7 of the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding employee benefit plans 

in december 2012 the company’s us defined benefit plan was amended to reflect a hard freeze as of december 31 2013 no further benefits will be provided after that date for additional credited service or earnings and all participants will become fully vested as of december 31 2013 the company recorded a 235 million noncash curtailment gain in december 2012 in connection with this amendment 

quarterly results of operations 

the following is a summary of the quarterly results of operations for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 

 

   

we recorded the quarterly earnings per share amounts as if each quarter was a discrete period as a result the sum of the basic and diluted earnings per share will not necessarily total the annual basic and diluted earnings per share 

the preparation of interim consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the amounts reported in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements specifically the company makes estimates and assumptions in its interim consolidated financial statements for the accrual of bad debts inventory adjustments and discount and volume incentives earned among others bad debts are accrued based on a percentage of sales and volume incentives are estimated based upon cumulative and projected purchasing levels inventory adjustments are accrued on an interim basis and adjusted in the fourth quarter based on the annual september and october booktophysical inventory adjustments the methodology and practices used in deriving estimates and assumptions for interim reporting typically result in adjustments upon accurate determination at yearend the effect of these adjustments in 2012 and 2011 was not significant

 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  tableend although the company does not face material risks related to interest rates and commodity prices the company is exposed to changes in foreign currency rates with respect to foreign currency denominated operating revenues and expenses 

foreign currency 

the company has translation gains or losses that result from translation of the results of operations of an operating unit’s foreign functional currency into us dollars for consolidated financial statement purposes the company’s principal foreign currency exchange exposure is the canadian dollar which is the functional currency of our canadian operations foreign currency exchange exposure particularly in regard to the canadian dollar and to a lesser extent the mexican peso negatively impacted our results for the year ended december 31 2012 

during 2012 and 2011 it was estimated that a 10 shift in exchange rates between those foreign functional currencies and the us dollar would have impacted translated net sales by approximately 176 million and 169 million respectively

set forth below are the material risks and uncertainties that if they were to occur could materially and adversely affect our business or could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements in this report and in the other public statements we make please be aware that these risks may change over time and other risks may prove to be important in the future new risks may emerge at any time and we cannot predict such risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our business financial condition results of operations or the trading price of our securities 

our business will be adversely affected if demand for our products slows 

our business depends on customer demand for the products that we distribute demand for these products depends on many factors 

with respect to our automotive group the primary factors are 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 with respect to our industrial parts group the primary factors are 

 

  

  

  

   

with respect to our office products group the primary factors are 

 

  

 with respect to our electricalelectronic materials group the primary factors are 

 

  

 uncertainty andor deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions including unemployment inflation or deflation high energy costs uncertain credit markets or other economic conditions could have a negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our business and operating results may in the future be adversely affected by uncertain global economic conditions including instability in credit markets declining consumer and business confidence fluctuating commodity prices volatile exchange rates and other challenges that could affect the global economy both our commercial and retail customers may experience deterioration of their financial resources which could result in existing or potential customers delaying or canceling plans to purchase our products our vendors could experience similar conditions which could impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us future weakness in the global economy could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows in future periods 

we depend on our relationships with our vendors and a disruption of our vendor relationships or a disruption in our vendors’ operations could harm our business 

as a distributor of automotive parts industrial parts office products and electricalelectronic materials our business depends on developing and maintaining close and productive relationships with our vendors we depend on our vendors to sell us quality products at favorable prices many factors outside our control including without limitation raw material shortages inadequate manufacturing capacity labor disputes transportation disruptions or weather conditions could adversely affect our vendors’ ability to deliver to us quality merchandise at favorable prices in a timely manner furthermore financial or operational difficulties with a particular vendor could cause that vendor to increase the cost of the products or decrease the quality of the products we purchase from it vendor consolidation could also limit the number of suppliers from which we may purchase products and could materially affect the prices we pay for these products in our automotive business the number of vendors could decrease considerably and the prices charged to us by the remaining vendors could increase to the extent that vehicle production slows due to a decline in consumer spending and possibly the failure of one or more of the large automobile manufacturers we would suffer an adverse impact if our vendors limit or cancel the return privileges that currently protect us from inventory obsolescence 

we face substantial competition in the industries in which we do business 

the sale of automotive and industrial parts office products and electrical materials is highly competitive and impacted by many factors including name recognition product availability customer service anticipating changing customer preferences store location and pricing pressures because we seek to offer competitive prices if our competitors reduce their prices we may be forced to reduce our prices which could result in a material decline in our revenues and earnings increased competition among distributors of automotive and industrial parts office products and electronic materials including internetrelated initiatives could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations the company anticipates no decline in competition in any of its four business segments in the foreseeable future 

  

in particular the market for replacement automotive parts is highly competitive and subjects us to a wide variety of competitors we compete primarily with national and regional auto parts chains independently owned regional and local automotive parts and accessories stores automobile dealers that supply manufacturer replacement parts and accessories mass merchandisers and wholesale clubs that sell automotive products and regional and local full service automotive repair shops furthermore the automotive aftermarket has experienced consolidation in recent years consolidation among our competitors could further enhance their financial position provide them with the ability to provide more competitive prices to customers for whom we compete and allow them to achieve increased efficiencies in their consolidated operations that enable them to more effectively compete for customers if we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies or if our competitors develop more effective strategies we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

we may not be able to successfully implement our business initiatives in each of our four business segments to grow our sales and earnings which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have implemented numerous initiatives in each of our four business segments to grow sales and earnings including the introduction of new and expanded product lines geographic expansion including acquisitions sales to new markets enhanced customer marketing programs and a variety of gross margin and cost savings initiatives if we are unable to implement these initiatives efficiently and effectively or if these initiatives are unsuccessful our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

successful implementation of these initiatives also depends on factors specific to the automotive parts industry and the other industries in which we operate and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control in addition to the other risk factors contained in this “item 1a risk factors” adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our business initiatives and have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 because we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees and other costs 

we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers employees or other third parties for various actions the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim this could have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

additionally we are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to environmental protection product quality standards building and zoning requirements as well as employment law matters if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs in addition our capital expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations

with regard to the december 31 2011 consolidated balance sheet the company’s cash balance of 525 million was consistent with cash of 530 million at december 31 2010 the company’s strong cash position was supported by the increase in net income and ongoing working capital management in 2011 accounts receivable increased by approximately 7 relatively inline with our sales increase in the fourth quarter of the year and inventory was up by less than 2 including acquisitions accounts payable increased 66 million or 5 from the prior year the company has increased this line item over the last several years due primarily to the combination of increased purchases improved payment terms with certain suppliers and other ongoing payables initiatives total debt outstanding at december 31 2011 was unchanged from 500 million at december 31 2010 

results of operations 

our results of operations are summarized below for the three years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 

 

 net sales 

consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31 2011 totaled 125 billion an 11 increase from 2010 driven by sales growth in all four of our business segments for the second consecutive year the industrial and electrical business segments experienced the greatest percentage increases for the year as the manufacturing sector of the economy held steady and strong in 2011 these businesses also benefited from acquisitions in 2011 sales for the automotive business segment also continued their positive trend in 2011 primarily due to the benefits of well executed internal initiatives and the overall solid fundamentals in the automotive aftermarket cumulatively prices in 2011 were up approximately 3 in the automotive segment up approximately 4 in the industrial segment up approximately 5 in the electrical segment and up approximately 2 in the office segment 

consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31 2010 totaled 112 billion an 11 increase from 2009 all four of our business segments showed sales growth for the year the industrial and electrical business segments had the greatest percentage increases for 2010 as the manufacturing sector of the economy was much stronger in 2010 relative to 2009 these businesses also benefited from acquisitions in 2010 sales for the automotive business segment were much improved in 2010 as well primarily due to the benefits of well executed internal initiatives and the overall improvement in the economy cumulatively prices in 2010 were up approximately 1 in the automotive segment up approximately 3 in the industrial segment up approximately 4 in the electrical segment and approximately flat in the office segment 

automotive group 

net sales for the automotive group “automotive” were 61 billion in 2011 an increase of 8 from 2010 sales improved in 2011 due to the successful execution of our sales initiatives and the ongoing solid fundamentals in the automotive aftermarket including the overall aging of the vehicle populations the positive fundamentals serve to drive increased demand for automotive aftermarket maintenance and supply items automotive revenues were up 9 in the first second and third quarters and were up 6 in the fourth quarter other factors impacting our automotive sales for the year include the effect of currency associated with our canadian and mexican businesses which positively impacted sales by approximately 1 

  

net sales for automotive were 56 billion in 2010 an increase of 7 from 2009 sales improved in 2010 due to the successful execution of our sales initiatives and the stronger economy which drove increased demand for automotive maintenance and supply items automotive revenues were up 6 in the first quarter followed by 7 increases in the second and third quarters and a 9 increase in the fourth quarter other factors impacting our automotive sales for the year include the effect of currency which positively impacted sales by approximately 2 

industrial group 

net sales for motion industries our industrial group “industrial” were 42 billion in 2011 an increase of 19 compared to 2010 several factors contributed to the sales increase for this group including the positive impact of their internal sales initiatives and the continued strength in the manufacturing sector of the economy served by industrial this was evidenced by the reported growth in the manufacturing industrial production and capacity utilization indices which this group tends to track also in 2011 sales were positively impacted by acquisitions which accounted for approximately 3 of industrial’s sales growth for the year and the effect of currency associated with our canadian business which positively impacted sales by less than 1 as a result of these several factors industrial revenues were up 24 in the first quarter of 2011 up 19 in the second quarter then up 18 and 13 in the third and fourth quarters respectively 

net sales for industrial were 35 billion in 2010 an increase of 22 compared to 2009 the positive impact of their internal sales initiatives and the strong rebound in the manufacturing sector of the economy served by industrial contributed to the sales increase for this group this was evidenced by the ongoing improvement in the manufacturing industrial production and capacity utilization indices also in 2010 sales were positively impacted by acquisitions which accounted for approximately 5 of industrial’s sales growth for the year as a result of these several factors industrial revenues were up 9 in the first quarter of 2010 up 26 in the second quarter then up 29 and 24 in the third and fourth quarters respectively 

office group 

net sales for s p richards our office products group “office” were 17 billion in 2011 up 3 from 2010 office revenues began to stabilize in 2010 relative to prior year trends and this group was able to make further progress in 2011 we were pleased to report growth for this business despite the ongoing difficult environment for the office products industry which we attribute to the generally slow recovery of white collar employment levels in the us sales increased approximately 5 4 and 3 in the first second and third quarters respectively and were down 1 in the fourth quarter of 2011 

net sales for office were 16 billion in 2010 up slightly compared to the prior year office revenues stabilized in 2010 although the office products industry continued to experience soft market conditions throughout the year as a result of reduced business spending and the ongoing impact of elevated unemployment levels sales decreased approximately 1 in the first and second quarters were flat in the third quarter and were up by 3 in the fourth quarter of 2010 the fourth quarter increase was significant as the industrywide slowdown in office products consumption had pressured this group for several years and the fourth quarter of 2010 marked the first positive sales comparison for office since the second quarter of 2007 

electrical group 

net sales for eis our electrical and electronic group “electrical” increased to 558 million in 2011 up 24 from 2010 our sales initiatives and the continued manufacturing expansion during the year as measured by the institute for supply management’s purchasing managers index were the primary sales drivers in 2011 in addition acquisitions in 2011 contributed approximately 11 to electrical’s sales growth and the effect of copper pricing had a 3 positive sales impact for the year electrical sales increased by 39 in the first quarter and this was followed by increases of 28 in the second quarter 22 in the third quarter and 10 in the fourth quarter 

net sales for electrical increased to 450 million in 2010 up 30 from 2009 electrical sales increased by 16 in the first quarter 32 in the second quarter 31 in the third quarter and 40 in the fourth quarter the 

  

revenue growth in 2010 was driven by our sales initiatives which were strongly supported by manufacturing expansion during the year as measured by the institute for supply management’s purchasing managers index in addition acquisitions in 2010 contributed approximately 9 to electrical’s sales growth for the year 

cost of goods sold 

cost of goods sold was 89 billion 80 billion and 70 billion in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the 11 increase in cost of goods sold from 2010 to 2011 is directly related to the sales increase for the same period cost of goods sold represented 711 of net sales in 2011 710  of net sales in 2010 and 701 of net sales in 2009 the increase in cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales for 2011 and 2010 relative to 2009 reflects the impact of certain pricing adjustments implemented in automotive as well as ongoing competitive pricing pressures in industrial and office these factors more than offset our gross margin initiatives to enhance our pricing strategies promote and sell higher margin products and minimize material acquisition costs hence the lower gross margin levels over the last two years 

in 2011 all four of our business segments experienced vendor price increases for the second consecutive year although in 2010 the automotive and office increases were relatively immaterial in 2009 our office and electrical business segments experienced vendor price increases while industrial was flat and automotive pricing was down for the year in any year where we experience price increases we are able to work with our customers to pass most of these along to them 

operating expenses 

selling administrative and other expenses “sga” increased by 228 million or 10 to 26 billion in 2011 representing 208 of net sales and down from 211 of net sales in 2010 sga expenses as a percentage of net sales improved from the prior year due primarily to the benefit of greater expense leverage associated with the second consecutive 11 sales increase in addition management’s ongoing cost control measures in areas such as personnel freight fleet and logistics have served to further improve the company’s cost structure after reducing the size of its workforce by approximately 12 during 2008 and 2009 the company has only added back approximately 2 of that over the two year period of 2011 and 2010 including acquisitions our management teams remain focused on properly managing the company’s expenses and continuing to assess the appropriate cost structure in our businesses depreciation and amortization expense in 2011 was 89 million relatively inline with 2010 the provision for doubtful accounts was 13 million in 2011 up nearly 3 million or 25 from 11 million in 2010 the increase in bad debt expense is primarily a function of the increase in sales for the year and not due to collections issues we believe the company is adequately reserved for bad debts at december 31 2011 

sga increased by 147 million or 7 to 24 billion in 2010 representing 211 of net sales and down from 221 of net sales in 2009 sga expenses as a percentage of net sales improved from the prior year due primarily to the benefit of greater expense leverage associated with the 11 sales increase for the year in addition management’s ongoing cost control measures in areas such as personnel freight fleet and logistics have served to further improve the company’s cost structure after reducing the size of its workforce by approximately 12 during 2008 and 2009 the company added back only 1 of that in 2010 including acquisitions in total of the estimated 70 million cost savings in 2009 the company estimates that it added back approximately 20 million in costs in 2010 primarily associated with the increase in sales and earnings depreciation and amortization expense in 2010 was 89 million down slightly from 2009 the provision for doubtful accounts was 11 million in 2010 down 61 from 28 million in 2009 the decrease in bad debt expense reflects a much improved collections environment in 2010 relative to the prior year 

total sharebased compensation expense for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 was 75 million 70 million and 86 million respectively refer to note 5 of the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding sharebased compensation 

  

nonoperating expenses and income 

nonoperating expenses consist primarily of interest interest expense was 27 million in 2011 and 28 million in 2010 and 2009 the 1 million decrease in interest expense relative to 2010 and 2009 is the result of an improved interest rate on certain longterm debt effective november 2011 

in “other” interest income net of noncontrolling interests has increased in each of the last two years due primarily to our improved cash position and the elimination of certain noncontrolling interests in 2009 

income before income taxes 

income before income taxes was 891 million in 2011 an increase of 17 from 762 million in 2010 as a percentage of net sales income before income taxes was 71 in 2011 reflecting an increase from 68 in 2010 in 2010 income before income taxes of 762 million was up 18 from 644 million in 2009 and as a percentage of net sales was 68 an increase from 64 in 2009 

automotive group 

automotive income before income taxes as a percentage of net sales which we refer to as operating margin increased to 77 in 2011 from 75 in 2010 the improvement in operating margin for 2011 is attributed to the benefit of greater expense leverage associated with automotive’s 8 sales increase for the year automotive’s initiatives to grow sales and control costs are intended to further improve its operating margin in the years ahead 

automotive’s operating margin increased to 75 in 2010 from 74 in 2009 the improvement in operating margin for 2010 is attributed to the benefit of greater expense leverage associated with automotive’s 7 sales increase for the year 

industrial group 

industrial’s operating margin increased to 81 in 2011 from 73 in 2010 the increase in operating margin in 2011 is due to the combination of greater expense leverage associated with a 19 sales increase industrial’s second straight year of strong doubledigit sales growth the ongoing benefits of recent cost savings and increased volume incentives industrial will continue to focus on its sales initiatives and cost controls to further improve its operating margin in the years ahead 

industrial’s operating margin increased to 73 in 2010 from 56 in 2009 the increase in operating margin in 2010 was due to the combination of greater expense leverage associated with a 22 sales increase cost savings and increased volume incentives 

office group 

office’s operating margin decreased slightly to 79 in 2011 from 80 in 2010 the decrease in operating margin in 2011 primarily reflects the continued pressures on gross margin in this industry due to the slower pace of the economic recovery and office employment these pressures were partially offset by the positive impact of office’s cost savings initiatives 

office’s operating margin increased to 80 in 2010 from 77 in 2009 and reflects the positive impact of our cost savings initiatives combined with the benefit of higher volume incentives from suppliers the increase in incentives was due to our fourth quarter sales growth and related increase in purchase volumes which allowed us to achieve higher program growth tiers with suppliers 

electrical group 

electrical’s operating margin increased to 73 in 2011 from 69 in 2010 the increase in operating margin in 2011 is due to the combination of greater expense leverage associated with a 24 sales increase its second straight year of strong doubledigit sales growth and the ongoing benefits of effective cost controls the improvement from these areas was partially offset by the increase in copper prices during the year electrical will continue to focus on its sales initiatives and cost controls to further improve its operating margin in the years ahead 

  

electrical’s operating margin decreased to 69 in 2010 from 73 in 2009 the decrease in operating margin was mainly due to escalating copper prices during the year which generally do not affect profit dollars but negatively impact margins as copper is generally billed to customers at cost the margin pressures associated with this industry standard pricing practice for copper more than offset the benefits of a stronger manufacturing sector in 2010 and greater expense leverage associated with a 30 sales increase 

income taxes 

the effective income tax rate of 366 in 2011 was down from 376 in 2010 the decrease from 2010 is primarily attributable to a favorable adjustment recorded in the first quarter of 2011 associated with the expiration of the statute of limitations related to certain international taxes the income tax rate decreased to 376 in 2010 from 380 in 2009 the decrease from 2009 is attributable to favorable foreign income taxes for the year 

net income 

net income was 565 million in 2011 an increase of 19 from 476 million in 2010 on a per share diluted basis net income was 358 in 2011 compared to 300 in 2010 up 19 net income in 2011 was 45 of net sales compared to 42 of net sales in 2010 

net income was 476 million in 2010 an increase of 19 from 400 million in 2009 on a per share diluted basis net income was 300 in 2010 compared to 250 in 2009 up 20 net income in 2010 was 42 of net sales compared to 40 of net sales in 2009 

financial condition 

our cash balance of 525 million at december 31 2011 was relatively consistent with our cash balance at december 31 2010 supported by the increase in net income in 2011 and ongoing working capital management the company’s accounts receivable balance at december 31 2011 increased by approximately 7 from the prior year which reflects the company’s 7 sales increase for the fourth quarter of 2011 inventory at december 31 2011 was up by less than 2 from december 31 2010 which is well below the company’s increase in sales and primarily attributable to acquisitions accounts payable increased 66 million or approximately 5 from december 31 2010 due primarily to increased inventory purchases related to the company’s sales increase goodwill and other intangible assets increased by 70 million or 34 from december 31 2010 due to the company’s acquisitions during the year the change in our december 31 2011 balances for deferred taxes up 94 million or 59 as well as pension and other postretirement benefits liabilities up 235 million or approximately 91 from december 31 2010 is primarily due to a change in funded status of the company’s pension and other postretirement plans in 2011 net of 58 million in pension contributions during the year 

liquidity and capital resources 

the company’s sources of capital consist primarily of cash flows from operations supplemented as necessary by private issuances of debt and bank borrowings we have 500 million of total debt outstanding at december 31 2011 of which 250 million matures in november 2013 and 250 million matures in november 2016 in addition the company has available a 350 million unsecured revolving line of credit no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit at december 31 2011 and 2010 the capital and credit markets were volatile over the last few years although these conditions did not materially impact our access to these markets currently we believe that our cash on hand and available shortterm and longterm sources of capital are sufficient to fund the company’s operations including working capital requirements scheduled debt payments interest payments capital expenditures benefit plan contributions income tax obligations dividends share repurchases and contemplated acquisitions 

the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 25 to 1 at december 31 2011 and this compares to 22 to 1 at december 31 2010 before consideration of current debt outstanding at december 21 2010 the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 26 to 1 our liquidity position remains solid the company’s 500 million in total debt outstanding at december 31 2011 is unchanged from 2010 

  

sources and uses of net cash 

a summary of the company’s consolidated statements of cash flows is as follows 

 

 net cash provided by operating activities 

the company continues to generate cash and net cash provided by operating activities totaled 625 million in 2011 this reflects an 8 decrease from 2010 as collectively trade accounts receivable merchandise inventories and trade accounts payable represented a 19 million use of cash in 2011 compared to a 185 million source of cash in 2010 this was partially offset by a 90 million increase in net income net cash provided by operating activities of 679 million in 2010 represents a 20 decrease from 2009 as collectively trade accounts receivable merchandise inventories and trade accounts payable as a source of cash was 129 million less in 2010 relative to 2009 and pension contributions in 2010 increased by 35 million from 2009 these items were partially offset by a 76 million increase in net income 

net cash used in investing activities 

net cash flow used in investing activities was 231 million in 2011 compared to 172 million in 2010 an increase of 34 cash used for acquisitions of businesses and other investing activities in 2011 were 46 million greater than in 2010 and capital expenditures increased by 18 million net cash flow used in investing activities was 172 million in 2010 compared to 264 million in 2009 a decrease of 35 cash used for acquisitions of businesses in 2010 was 44 million less than in 2009 while capital expenditures increased by 16 million for the year the decrease in investing activities was primarily due to a 73 million purchase of properties under a construction and lease agreement in 2009 

net cash used in financing activities 

the company used 394 million of cash in financing activities in 2011 a 23 increase from the 321 million used in financing activities in 2010 in 2010 the 321 million of cash used in financing activities was down 3 from the 330 million used in 2009 for the three years presented net cash used in financing activities was primarily for dividends paid to shareholders and repurchases of the company’s common stock the company paid dividends to shareholders of 276 million 258 million and 254 million during 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the company expects this trend of increasing dividends to continue in the foreseeable future during 2011 2010 and 2009 the company repurchased 122 million 75 million and 26 million respectively of the company’s common stock we expect to remain active in our share repurchase program but the amount and value of shares repurchased will vary 

notes and other borrowings 

the company maintains a 350 million unsecured revolving line of credit with a consortium of financial institutions which matures in december 2012 and bears interest at libor plus 30 060 at december 31 2011 at december 31 2011 and 2010 no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit due to the workers’ compensation and insurance reserve requirements in certain states the company also had unused letters of credit of approximately 54 million and 50 million outstanding at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively 

at december 31 2011 the company had unsecured senior notes outstanding under a 500 million financing arrangement as follows 250 million series c senior unsecured note 467 fixed due 2013 and 250 million series d and e senior unsecured notes 335 fixed due 2016 these borrowings contain covenants 

  

related to a maximum debttocapitalization ratio and certain limitations on additional borrowings at december 31 2011 the company was in compliance with all such covenants the weighted average interest rate on the company’s total outstanding borrowings was approximately 401 at december 31 2011 and 545 at december 31 2010 total interest expense net of interest income for all borrowings was 246 million 266 million and 271 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

contractual and other obligations 

the following table shows the company’s approximate obligations and commitments including interest due on credit facilities to make future payments under specified contractual obligations as of december 31 2011 

contractual obligations 

 

 due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with the company’s unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2011 the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities therefore 60 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above refer to note 6 of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes 

purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in our estimates we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements our purchase orders are based on our current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons the company does not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements 

the company guarantees the borrowings of certain independently owned automotive parts stores independents and certain other affiliates in which the company has a noncontrolling equity ownership interest affiliates the company’s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these independents and affiliates is generally equal to the total borrowings subject to the company’s guarantee to date the company has had no significant losses in connection with guarantees of independents’ and affiliates’ borrowings the following table shows the company’s approximate commercial commitments as of december 31 2011 

other commercial commitments 

 

   

in addition the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans that may obligate us to make contributions to the plans from time to time contributions in 2011 were 58 million we expect to make a 17 million cash contribution to our qualified defined benefit plans in 2012 and contributions required for 2012 and future years will depend on a number of unpredictable factors including the market performance of the plans’ assets and future changes in interest rates that affect the actuarial measurement of the plans’ obligations 

share repurchases 

in 2011 the company repurchased approximately 24 million shares and the company had remaining authority to purchase approximately 135 million shares at december 31 2011 

critical accounting policies 

general 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

we describe in this section certain critical accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates assumptions and judgments an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially impact the consolidated financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for further information on the critical accounting policies see note 1 of the consolidated financial statements 

inventories — provisions for slow moving and obsolescence 

the company identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates appropriate loss provisions related thereto historically these loss provisions have not been significant as the vast majority of the company’s inventories are not highly susceptible to obsolescence and are eligible for return under various vendor return programs while the company has no reason to believe its inventory return privileges will be discontinued in the future its risk of loss associated with obsolete or slow moving inventories would increase if such were to occur 

allowance for doubtful accounts — methodology 

the company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors initially the company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on historical bad debt experience this initial estimate is periodically adjusted when the company becomes aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations eg bankruptcy filing or as a result of changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable while the company has a large customer base that is geographically dispersed a general economic downturn in any of the industry segments in which the company operates could result in higher than expected defaults and therefore the need to revise estimates for bad debts for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 the company recorded provisions for doubtful accounts of 132 million 106 million and 285 million respectively 

  

consideration received from vendors 

the company enters into agreements at the beginning of each year with many of its vendors that provide for inventory purchase incentives generally the company earns inventory purchase incentives upon achieving specified volume purchasing levels or other criteria the company accrues for the receipt of these incentives as part of its inventory cost based on cumulative purchases of inventory to date and projected inventory purchases through the end of the year while management believes the company will continue to receive consideration from vendors in 2012 and beyond there can be no assurance that vendors will continue to provide comparable amounts of incentives in the future or that we will be able to achieve the specified volumes necessary to take advantage of such incentives 

impairment of property plant and equipment and goodwill and other intangible assets 

at least annually the company evaluates property plant and equipment goodwill and other intangible assets for potential impairment indicators the company’s judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance among other factors future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired evaluating for impairment also requires the company to estimate future operating results and cash flows which require judgment by management any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

employee benefit plans 

the company’s benefit plan committees in the us and canada establish investment policies and strategies and regularly monitor the performance of the company’s pension plan assets the pension plan investment strategy implemented by the company’s management is to achieve longterm objectives and invest the pension assets in accordance with the applicable pension legislation in the us and canada as well as fiduciary standards the longterm primary objectives for the pension plan funds are to provide for a reasonable amount of longterm growth of capital without undue exposure to risk protect the assets from erosion of purchasing power and provide investment results that meet or exceed the pension plan’s actuarially assumed long term rate of return the company’s investment strategy with respect to pension plan assets is to generate a return in excess of the passive portfolio benchmark 50 sp 500 index 5 russell mid cap index 10 russell 2000 index 5 msci eafe index and 30 barcap us govtcredit 

we make several critical assumptions in determining our pension plan liabilities and related pension expense we believe the most critical of these assumptions are the expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate other assumptions we make relate to employee demographic factors such as rate of compensation increases mortality rates retirement patterns and turnover rates 

based on the investment policy for the pension plans as well as an asset study that was performed based on the company’s asset allocations and future expectations the company’s expected rate of return on plan assets for measuring 2012 pension expense or income is 784 for the plans the asset study forecasted expected rates of return for the approximate duration of the company’s benefit obligations using capital market data and historical relationships 

the discount rate is chosen as the rate at which pension obligations could be effectively settled and is based on capital market conditions as of the measurement date we have matched the timing and duration of the expected cash flows of our pension obligations to a yield curve generated from a broad portfolio of highquality fixed income debt instruments to select our discount rate based upon this cash flow matching analysis we selected a weighted average discount rate for the plans of 517 at december 31 2011 

net periodic benefit cost for our defined benefit pension plans was 323 million 219 million and 73 million for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the increase in pension cost in 2011 from 2010 reflects the change in assumptions for the rate of return on plan assets the discount rate and the rate of compensation increases the increase in pension cost in 2010 from 2009 was primarily due to the curtailment and subsequent remeasurement of the us defined benefit pension plan in 2009 and the change in assumptions for the rate of return on plan assets the discount rate and the rate of compensation increases the 2009 

  

curtailment and subsequent remeasurement decreased benefit costs in 2009 and are discussed further below refer to note 7 of the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding employee benefit plans 

in april 2009 the company recorded a 43 million noncash curtailment adjustment in connection with a plan reorganization which reduced the expected years of future service of employees covered by the us defined benefit pension plan 

in july 2009 the company announced changes to the us postretirement benefit plan effective january 1 2010 future retirees no longer receive employerprovided medical benefits and current pre65 retirees no longer receive employerprovided post65 benefits beyond an accessonly arrangement 

quarterly results of operations

 we recorded the quarterly earnings per share amounts as if each quarter was a discrete period as a result the sum of the basic and diluted earnings per share will not necessarily total the annual basic and diluted earnings per share 

the preparation of interim consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the amounts reported in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements specifically the company makes estimates and assumptions in its interim consolidated financial statements for the accrual of bad debts inventory adjustments and discount and volume incentives earned among others bad debts are accrued based on a percentage of sales and volume incentives are estimated based upon cumulative and projected purchasing levels inventory adjustments are accrued on an interim basis and adjusted in the fourth quarter based on the annual september and october booktophysical inventory adjustments the methodology and practices used in deriving estimates and assumptions for interim reporting typically result in adjustments upon accurate determination at yearend the effect of these adjustments in 2011 and 2010 was not significant

as a distributor of automotive replacement parts industrial parts office products and electricalelectronic materials our business depends on developing and maintaining close and productive relationships with our vendors we depend on our vendors to sell us quality products at favorable prices many factors outside our control including without limitation raw material shortages inadequate manufacturing capacity labor disputes transportation disruptions or weather conditions could adversely affect our vendors’ ability to deliver to us quality merchandise at favorable prices in a timely manner furthermore financial or operational difficulties with a particular vendor could cause that vendor to increase the cost of the products or decrease the quality of the products we purchase from it vendor consolidation could also limit the number of suppliers from which we may purchase products and could materially affect the prices we pay for these products in our automotive business the number of vendors could decrease considerably and the prices charged to us by the remaining vendors could increase to the extent that vehicle production slows due to a decline in consumer spending and possibly the failure of one or more of the large automobile manufacturers we would suffer an adverse impact if our vendors limit or cancel the return privileges that currently protect us from inventory obsolescence 

 

we face substantial competition in the industries in which we do business 

 

the sale of automotive and industrial parts office products and electrical materials is highly competitive and impacted by many factors including name recognition product availability customer service anticipating changing customer preferences store location and pricing pressures because we seek to offer competitive prices if our competitors reduce their prices we may be forced to reduce our prices which could result in a material decline in our revenues and earnings increased competition among distributors of automotive and industrial parts office products and electronic materials including internetrelated initiatives could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations the company anticipates no decline in competition in any of its four business segments in the foreseeable future 

 

in particular the market for replacement automotive parts is highly competitive and subjects us to a wide variety of competitors we compete primarily with national and regional auto parts chains independently owned regional and local automotive parts and accessories stores automobile dealers that supply manufacturer replacement parts and accessories mass merchandisers and wholesale clubs that sell automotive products and regional and local full service automotive repair shops furthermore the automotive aftermarket has experienced consolidation in recent years consolidation among our competitors could further enhance their financial position provide them with the ability to provide more competitive prices to customers for whom we compete and allow them to achieve increased efficiencies in their consolidated operations that enable them to more effectively compete for customers if we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies or if our competitors develop more effective strategies we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

we may not be able to successfully implement our business initiatives in each of our four business segments to grow our sales and earnings which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

we have implemented numerous initiatives in each of our four business segments to grow sales and earnings including the introduction of new and expanded product lines geographic expansion including acquisitions sales to new markets enhanced customer marketing programs and a variety of gross margin and cost savings initiatives if we are unable to implement these initiatives efficiently and effectively or if these initiatives are unsuccessful our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

 

successful implementation of these initiatives also depends on factors specific to the automotive parts industry and the other industries in which we operate and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control in addition to the other risk factors contained in this “item 1a risk factors” adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our business initiatives and have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

  

because we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees and other costs 

 

we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers employees or other third parties for various actions the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim this could have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

additionally we are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to environmental protection product quality standards building and zoning requirements as well as employment law matters if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs in addition our capital expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations

overview 

 

genuine parts company is a service organization engaged in the distribution of automotive replacement parts industrial replacement parts office products and electricalelectronic materials the company has a long tradition of growth dating back to 1928 the year we were founded in atlanta georgia in 2010 the company conducted business throughout the united states canada mexico and puerto rico from approximately 2000 locations 

 

we recorded consolidated net sales of 112 billion for the year ended december 31 2010 an increase of 11 compared to 101 billion in 2009 consolidated net income for the year ended december 31 2010 was 476 million up 19 from 400 million in 2009 the improving market conditions in the industries that we serve combined with our internal growth initiatives drove the company’s strong performance in 2010 

 

the 11 sales growth in 2010 follows a 9 decrease in revenues in 2009 and a 2 increase in revenues in 2008 our 19 increase in net income follows a 16 and 6 decrease in net income in 2009 and 2008 respectively throughout this three year period the company has implemented a variety of initiatives in each of our four business segments to grow sales and earnings including the introduction of new and expanded product lines geographic expansion including acquisitions sales to new markets enhanced customer marketing programs and a variety of gross margin and cost savings initiatives the effects of the economic slowdown which we began to experience in the final quarter of 2008 adversely impacted the benefit of these initiatives through 2009 in 2010 however the recovering economy served to further support the benefits of our internal growth initiatives 

 

with regard to the december 31 2010 consolidated balance sheet the company’s cash balance of 530 million was up 193 million or 57 from 337 million at december 31 2009 this increase marks the second consecutive year the company has significantly improved its cash position and relates to the increase in net income in 2010 and an improved working capital position for both years accounts receivable increased by approximately 15 

relatively inline with our sales increase in the fourth quarter of the year and inventory was up slightly including acquisitions accounts payable increased 281 million or 26 from the prior year due primarily to improved payment terms with certain suppliers and other ongoing payables initiatives such as a procurement card program total debt outstanding at december 31 2010 was unchanged from 500 million at december 31 2009 

 

results of operations 

 

our results of operations are summarized below for the three years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

 

 

net sales 

 

consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31 2010 totaled 112 billion an 11 increase from 2009 driven by sales growth in all four of our business segments the industrial and electrical business segments experienced the greatest percentage increases for the year as the manufacturing sector of the economy was much stronger in 2010 relative to 2009 these businesses also benefited from acquisitions in 2010 sales for the automotive business segment were much improved in 2010 as well primarily due to the benefits of well executed internal initiatives and the overall improvement in the economy cumulatively prices in 2010 were up approximately 1 in the automotive segment up approximately 3 in the industrial segment up approximately 4 in the electrical segment and approximately flat in the office segment 

 

consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31 2009 totaled 101 billion a 9 decrease from 2008 each of our four businesses experienced sales decreases with the industrial and electrical business segments showing the most significant declines as the manufacturing sector of the economy was severely impacted by the weak economic conditions which we began to experience in the latter part of 2008 the general weakness in demand resulting from lower consumer spending and industrial production and higher unemployment appeared to stabilize over the last half of 2009 among the four quarters in 2009 the fourth quarter was the strongest period for sales in each business segment cumulatively prices in 2009 were down approximately 3 in the automotive segment approximately flat in the industrial segment and up approximately 4 in the office segment and 2 in the electrical segment 

 

automotive group 

 

net sales for the automotive group “automotive” were 56 billion in 2010 an increase of 7 from 2009 sales improved in 2010 due to the successful execution of our sales initiatives and the stronger economy which drove increased demand for automotive maintenance and supply items automotive revenues were up 6 in the first quarter followed by 7 increases in the second and third quarters and a 9 increase in the fourth quarter other factors impacting our automotive sales for the year include the effect of currency which positively impacted sales by approximately 2 

 

automotive sales were 52 billion in 2009 a decrease of 2 from 2008 sales were impacted by the soft economy in 2009 which reduced the overall level of consumer spending and specifically the demand for automotive maintenance and supply items the first half of the year proved to be the most challenging with automotive sales down 7 and 5 in the first and second quarters respectively sales were down 1 in the third quarter followed by a 6 increase in the fourth quarter other factors impacting our automotive sales for the year include acquisitions which had an approximately 1 positive effect on sales and the effect of currency which negatively impacted sales by approximately 2 

industrial group 

 

net sales for motion industries our industrial group “industrial” were 35 billion in 2010 an increase of 22 compared to 2009 several factors contributed to the sales increase for this group including the positive impact of their internal sales initiatives and the strong rebound in the manufacturing sector of the economy served by industrial this was evidenced by the ongoing improvement in the manufacturing industrial production and capacity utilization indices which this group tends to track also in 2010 sales were positively impacted by acquisitions which accounted for approximately 5 of industrial’s sales growth for the year as a result of these several factors industrial revenues were up 9 in the first quarter of 2010 up 26 in the second quarter then up 29 and 24 in the third and fourth quarters respectively 

 

net sales were 29 billion in 2009 a decrease of 18 compared to 2008 through the first three quarters of the year sales were especially weak for this group due to the effects of very low manufacturing activity as evidenced by the reported levels of manufacturing industrial production and capacity utilization and its negative impact on demand for industrial products this weakness was widespread as we experienced sales declines in nearly all of our major customer categories the industrial indices we follow showed some early signs of stabilization in the third quarter and we observed a slight strengthening in these indicators as we entered the fourth quarter industrial sales were down 11 in the fourth quarter which marked a significant improvement from the declines of the first three quarters of the year in 2009 sales were positively impacted by several acquisitions which contributed approximately 3 to sales for the year 

 

office group 

 

net sales for sp richards our office products group “office” were 16 billion in 2010 up slightly compared to the prior year office revenues stabilized in 2010 relative to prior year trends although the office products industry continued to experience soft market conditions throughout the year as a result of reduced business spending and the ongoing impact of elevated unemployment levels sales decreased approximately 1 in the first and second quarters were flat in the third quarter and were up by 3 in the fourth quarter of 2010 the fourth quarter increase is significant as the industrywide slowdown in office products consumption has pressured this group for several years and the fourth quarter of 2010 marks the first positive sales comparison for office since the second quarter of 2007 

 

net sales were 16 billion in 2009 down 5 compared to 2008 and the third consecutive year of decreased revenues for office this three year sales trend reflects the negative impact of higher white collar and service unemployment on office products consumption which has affected the office products industry since 2007 in 2009 sales improved sequentially with decreases of 7 6 5 and 4 in the first second third and fourth quarters respectively for the year sales were positively impacted by three acquisitions completed in 2008 which contributed nearly 3 to sales in office the increase in net sales due to acquisitions as well as our sales initiatives was more than offset by the prevailing poor conditions in the office products industry 

 

electrical group 

 

net sales for eis our electrical and electronic group “electrical” increased to 450 million in 2010 up 30 from 2009 electrical sales increased by 16 in the first quarter and this was followed by increases of 32 in the second quarter 31 in the third quarter and 40 in the fourth quarter the revenue growth in 2010 was driven by our sales initiatives which were strongly supported by manufacturing expansion during the year as measured by the institute for supply management’s purchasing managers index in addition acquisitions in 2010 contributed approximately 9 to electrical’s sales growth for the year 

 

net sales decreased to 346 million in 2009 down 26 from 2008 electrical sales declined by 25 in the first quarter 34 in the second quarter and 30 in the third quarter for the fourth quarter sales were down 12 manufacturing contraction as measured by the institute for supply management’s purchasing managers index was evident through june and then began to stabilize and improve over the last half of the year this factor explains the quarterly sales trends at electrical in 2009 acquisitions had less than a 1 positive impact on electrical sales in 2009 

cost of goods sold 

 

cost of goods sold was 80 billion 70 billion and 77 billion in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the 13 increase in cost of goods sold from 2009 to 2010 is directly related to the sales increase for the same period cost of goods sold represented 710 of net sales in 2010 701 of net sales in 2009 and 703 of net sales in 2008 the increase in cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales in 2010 relative to 2009 and 2008 reflects the impact of certain pricing adjustments implemented in automotive during 2009 as well as ongoing competitive pricing pressures in office these factors more than offset our gross margin initiatives to enhance our pricing strategies promote and sell higher margin products and minimize material acquisition costs 

 

in 2010 all four of our business segments experienced vendor price increases although the automotive and office increases were relatively immaterial in 2009 our office and electrical business segments experienced vendor price increases industrial was flat and automotive pricing was down for the year in 2008 all four of our business segments experienced vendor price increases in any year where we experience price increases we are able to work with our customers to pass most of these along to them 

 

operating expenses 

 

selling administrative and other expenses “sga” increased by 147 million or 7 to 24 billion in 2010 representing 211 of net sales and down from 221 of net sales in 2009 sga expenses as a percentage of net sales improved from the prior year due primarily to the benefit of greater expense leverage associated with the 11 sales increase for the year in addition management’s ongoing cost control measures in areas such as personnel freight fleet and logistics have served to further improve the company’s cost structure after reducing the size of its workforce by approximately 12 during 2008 and 2009 the company added back only 1 of that in 2010 including acquisitions despite the 11 increase in revenues in total of the estimated 70 million cost savings in 2009 the company estimates that it added back approximately 20 million in costs in 2010 primarily associated with the increase in sales and earnings our management teams remain focused on the ongoing assessment of the appropriate cost structure in our businesses depreciation and amortization expense in 2010 was 89 million down slightly from 2009 the provision for doubtful accounts was 11 million in 2010 down 61 from 28 million in 2009 the decrease in bad debt expense reflects a much improved collections environment in 2010 relative to the prior year we believe the company is adequately reserved for bad debts at december 31 2010 

 

in 2009 sga was 22 billion down 140 million or 6 from 2008 and representing 221 of net sales this compared to 214 of net sales in 2008 this percentage increase was primarily due to the loss of expense leverage associated with the 9 sales decrease for the year during 2009 management implemented extensive cost control initiatives to offset this loss of leverage these measures eliminated approximately 70 million in operating costs and helped drive the decrease in absolute sga dollars for the year depreciation and amortization expense in 2009 was 90 million up slightly from 2008 the provision for doubtful accounts was 28 million in 2009 up 17 from a 24 million bad debt expense in 2008 

 

total sharebased compensation expense for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 was 70 million 86 million and 130 million respectively refer to note 5 of the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding sharebased compensation 

 

nonoperating expenses and income 

 

nonoperating expenses consist primarily of interest interest expense was 28 million in 2010 and 2009 and 32 million in 2008 the decrease in expense relative to 2008 is the result of an improved interest rate on certain longterm debt effective november 2008 

 

in “other” interest income net of noncontrolling interests has increased in each of the last two years due primarily to our improved cash position and the elimination of certain noncontrolling interests in 2009 

 

income before income taxes 

 

income before income taxes was 762 million in 2010 an increase of 183 from 644 million in 2009 as a percentage of net sales income before income taxes was 68 in 2010 reflecting an increase from 64 in 2009 in 

2009 income before income taxes of 644 million was down 160 from 768 million in 2008 and as a percentage of net sales was 64 a decrease from 70 in 2008 

 

automotive group 

 

automotive income before income taxes as a percentage of net sales which we refer to as operating margin increased to 75 in 2010 from 74 in 2009 the improvement in operating margin for 2010 is attributed to the benefit of greater expense leverage associated with automotive’s 7 sales increase for the year automotive’s initiatives to grow sales and control costs are intended to further improve its operating margin in the years ahead 

 

automotive’s operating margin increased to 74 in 2009 from 72 in 2008 the improvement in operating margin for 2009 is attributed to the benefit of cost reduction measures implemented during 2008 and 2009 

 

industrial group 

 

industrial’s operating margin increased to 73 in 2010 from 56 in 2009 the increase in operating margin in 2010 is due to the combination of greater expense leverage associated with a 22 sales increase cost savings and increased volume incentives industrial will continue to focus on its sales initiatives and cost controls to further improve its operating margin in the years ahead 

 

industrial’s operating margin decreased to 56 in 2009 from 84 in 2008 the decrease in operating margin in 2009 was primarily a reflection of the extreme downturn in industrial demand that we began to experience in the fourth quarter of 2008 these conditions led to lower sales volumes in 2009 which severely impacted our expense leverage despite significant cost reduction efforts 

 

office group 

 

the operating margin in office increased to 80 in 2010 from 77 in 2009 the increase in operating margin in 2010 reflects the positive impact of our cost savings initiatives combined with the benefit of higher volume incentives from suppliers the increase in incentives was due to our fourth quarter sales growth and related increase in purchase volumes which allowed us to achieve higher program growth tiers with suppliers 

 

the operating margin in office was 77 in 2009 down from 83 in 2008 the prevailing weakness in the office products industry that began in 2007 continued to pressure the operating margin at office in 2009 

 

electrical group 

 

the operating margin in electrical decreased to 69 in 2010 from 73 in 2009 the decrease in operating margin is mainly due to escalating copper prices during the year which generally do not affect profit dollars but negatively impact margins as copper is generally billed to customers at cost the margin pressures associated with this industry standard pricing practice for copper more than offset the benefits of a stronger manufacturing sector in 2010 and greater expense leverage associated with a 30 sales increase 

 

the operating margin in electrical decreased to 73 in 2009 from 79 in 2008 the decrease in operating margin was primarily a function of weak market conditions this factor outweighed the benefits of electrical’s sales initiatives and expense savings 

 

income taxes 

 

the effective income tax rate of 376 in 2010 was down from 380 in 2009 the decrease from 2009 is attributable to favorable foreign income taxes for the year the income tax rate decreased to 380 in 2009 from 381 in 2008 the decrease from the 2008 rate is mainly due to taxfree income in 2009 associated with a company retirement plan 

net income 

 

net income was 476 million in 2010 an increase of 19 from 400 million in 2009 on a per share diluted basis net income was 300 in 2010 compared to 250 in 2009 up 20 net income in 2010 was 42 of net sales compared to 40 of net sales in 2009 

 

net income of 400 million in 2009 was down 16 from 475 million in 2008 on a per share diluted basis net income of 250 in 2009 was down 14 compared to 292 in 2008 net income in 2009 was 40 of net sales compared to 43 of net sales in 2008 

 

financial condition 

 

our cash balance of 530 million at december 31 2010 was up 193 million or 57 from december 31 2009 due primarily to the increase in net income in 2010 and an improved working capital position relative to 2009 the company’s accounts receivable balance at december 31 2010 increased by approximately 15 from the prior year which reflects the company’s 14 sales increase for the fourth quarter of 2010 inventory at december 31 2010 was up slightly from december 31 2009 which is well below the company’s increase in sales and primarily attributable to acquisitions accounts payable increased 281 million or approximately 26 from december 31 2009 due primarily to increased inventory purchases related to the company’s sales increase improved payment terms with certain suppliers and other payables initiatives such as the ongoing expansion of our procurement card program goodwill and other intangible assets increased by 38 million or 22 from december 31 2009 due to the company’s acquisitions during the year the change in our december 31 2010 balance for the pension and other postretirement benefits liabilities down 41 million or approximately 14 from december 31 2009 is primarily due to a change in funded status of the company’s pension and other postretirement plans in 2010 and a 91 million pension contribution during the year 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

the company’s sources of capital consist primarily of cash flows from operations supplemented as necessary by private issuances of debt and bank borrowings we have 500 million of total debt outstanding at december 31 2010 of which 250 million matures in november 2011 and is accounted for as current debt at december 31 2010 the remaining 250 million matures in november 2013 in addition the company has available a 350 million unsecured revolving line of credit no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit at december 31 2010 and 2009 the capital and credit markets were volatile over the last few years although these conditions did not materially impact our access to these markets currently we believe that our cash on hand and available shortterm and longterm sources of capital are sufficient to fund the company’s operations including working capital requirements scheduled debt payments interest payments capital expenditures benefit plan contributions income tax obligations dividends share repurchases and contemplated acquisitions 

 

the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 22 to 1 at december 31 2010 and before consideration of current debt was 26 to 1 this compares to 29 to 1 at december 31 2009 our liquidity position remains solid the company’s 500 million in total debt outstanding at december 31 2010 is unchanged from 2009 

 

sources and uses of net cash 

 

a summary of the company’s consolidated statements of cash flows is as follows 

 

 

net cash provided by operating activities 

 

the company continues to generate cash and net cash provided by operating activities totaled 679 million in 2010 this reflects a 20 decrease from 2009 as working capital as a source of cash was 129 million less in 2010 relative to 2009 and pension contributions in 2010 increased by 35 million from 2009 these items were partially offset by a 76 million increase in net income net cash provided by operating activities of 845 million in 2009 represents a 59 increase from 2008 and primarily relates to the 368 million net decrease in cash used for working capital requirements including accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable net of the 76 million decrease in net income from 2008 

 

net cash used in investing activities 

 

net cash flow used in investing activities was 172 million in 2010 compared to 264 million in 2009 a decrease of 35 cash used for acquisitions of businesses in 2010 was 44 million less than in 2009 while capital expenditures increased by 16 million for the year the decrease in investing activities was primarily due to a 73 million purchase of properties under a construction and lease agreement in 2009 this transaction also explains the increase in investing activities in 2009 from 2008 net of a 36 million decrease in capital expenditures in 2009 from 2008 cash used for acquisitions of businesses in 2009 was relatively consistent with 2008 

 

net cash used in financing activities 

 

the company used 321 million of cash in financing activities in 2010 a 3 decrease from the 330 million used in financing activities in 2009 cash used in financing activities in 2009 was down 30 from the 473 million used in 2008 for the three years presented net cash used in financing activities was primarily for dividends paid to shareholders and repurchases of the company’s common stock the company paid dividends to shareholders of 258 million 254 million and 252 million during 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the company expects this trend of increasing dividends to continue in the foreseeable future during 2010 2009 and 2008 the company repurchased 75 million 26 million and 273 million respectively of the company’s common stock we expect to remain active in our share repurchase program but the amount and value of shares repurchased will vary annually 

 

notes and other borrowings 

 

the company maintains a 350 million unsecured revolving line of credit with a consortium of financial institutions which matures in december 2012 and bears interest at libor plus 30 056 at december 31 2010 at december 31 2010 and 2009 no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit due to the workers’ compensation and insurance reserve requirements in certain states the company also had unused letters of credit of approximately 50 million outstanding at december 31 2010 and 2009 

 

at december 31 2010 the company had unsecured senior notes outstanding under a 500 million financing arrangement as follows 250 million series b 623 fixed due 2011 and 250 million senior unsecured note 467 fixed due 2013 these borrowings contain covenants related to a maximum debttocapitalization ratio and certain limitations on additional borrowings at december 31 2010 the company was in compliance with all such covenants the weighted average interest rate on the company’s outstanding borrowings was approximately 545 at december 31 2010 and 2009 total interest expense net of interest income for all borrowings was 266 million 271 million and 298 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

contractual and other obligations 

 

in october 2007 the company entered into a saleleaseback transaction with a financial institution in connection with the transaction the company sold certain automotive retail store properties and immediately leased the properties back over a lease term of twenty years the lease was classified as an operating lease net proceeds from the transaction amounted to approximately 56 million the company realized a net gain of approximately 20 million which was deferred and is being amortized over the lease term 

the following table shows the company’s approximate obligations and commitments including interest due on credit facilities to make future payments under specified contractual obligations as of december 31 2010 

 

contractual obligations 

 

 

 

due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with the company’s unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2010 the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities therefore 50 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above refer to note 6 of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes 

 

purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in our estimates we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements our purchase orders are based on our current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons the company does not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements 

 

the company guarantees the borrowings of certain independently owned automotive parts stores independents and certain other affiliates in which the company has a noncontrolling equity ownership interest affiliates the company’s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these independents and affiliates is generally equal to the total borrowings subject to the company’s guarantee to date the company has had no significant losses in connection with guarantees of independents’ and affiliates’ borrowings the following table shows the company’s approximate commercial commitments as of december 31 2010 

 

other commercial commitments 

 

 

 

in addition the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans that may obligate us to make contributions to the plans from time to time contributions in 2010 were 91 million we expect to make a 52 million cash contribution to our qualified defined benefit plans in 2011 and contributions required for 2011 and future years will depend on a number of unpredictable factors including the market performance of the plans’ assets and future changes in interest rates that affect the actuarial measurement of the plans’ obligations 

 

share repurchases 

 

in 2010 the company repurchased approximately 18 million shares and the company had remaining authority to purchase approximately 160 million shares at december 31 2010 

critical accounting policies 

 

general 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

 

we describe in this section certain critical accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates assumptions and judgments an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially impact the consolidated financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for further information on the critical accounting policies see note 1 of the consolidated financial statements 

 

inventories — provisions for slow moving and obsolescence 

 

the company identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates appropriate loss provisions related thereto historically these loss provisions have not been significant as the vast majority of the company’s inventories are not highly susceptible to obsolescence and are eligible for return under various vendor return programs while the company has no reason to believe its inventory return privileges will be discontinued in the future its risk of loss associated with obsolete or slow moving inventories would increase if such were to occur 

 

allowance for doubtful accounts — methodology 

 

the company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors initially the company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on historical bad debt experience this initial estimate is periodically adjusted when the company becomes aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations eg bankruptcy filing or as a result of changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable while the company has a large customer base that is geographically dispersed a general economic downturn in any of the industry segments in which the company operates could result in higher than expected defaults and therefore the need to revise estimates for bad debts for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 the company recorded provisions for bad debts of 106 million 285 million and 239 million respectively 

 

consideration received from vendors 

 

the company enters into agreements at the beginning of each year with many of its vendors that provide for inventory purchase incentives generally the company earns inventory purchase incentives upon achieving specified volume purchasing levels or other criteria the company accrues for the receipt of these incentives as part of its inventory cost based on cumulative purchases of inventory to date and projected inventory purchases through the end of the year while management believes the company will continue to receive consideration from vendors in 2011 and beyond there can be no assurance that vendors will continue to provide comparable amounts of incentives in the future or that we will be able to achieve the specified volumes necessary to take advantage of such incentives 

impairment of property plant and equipment and goodwill and other intangible assets 

 

at least annually the company evaluates property plant and equipment goodwill and other intangible assets for potential impairment indicators the company’s judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance among other factors future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired evaluating for impairment also requires the company to estimate future operating results and cash flows which require judgment by management any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

 

employee benefit plans 

 

the company’s benefit plan committees in the us and canada establish investment policies and strategies and regularly monitor the performance of the company’s pension plan assets the pension plan investment strategy implemented by the company’s management is to achieve longterm objectives and invest the pension assets in accordance with the applicable pension legislation in the us and canada and fiduciary standards the longterm primary objectives for the pension plan funds are to provide for a reasonable amount of longterm growth of capital without undue exposure to risk protect the assets from erosion of purchasing power and provide investment results that meet or exceed the pension plan’s actuarially assumed long term rate of return the company’s investment strategy with respect to pension plan assets is to generate a return in excess of the passive portfolio benchmark 50 sp 500 index 5 russell mid cap index 10 russell 2000 index 5 msci eafe index and 30 barcap us govtcredit 

 

we make several critical assumptions in determining our pension plan liabilities and related pension expense we believe the most critical of these assumptions are the expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate other assumptions we make relate to employee demographic factors such as rate of compensation increases mortality rates retirement patterns and turnover rates 

 

based on the investment policy for the pension plans as well as an asset study that was performed based on the company’s asset allocations and future expectations the company’s expected rate of return on plan assets for measuring 2011 pension expense or income is 787 for the plans the asset study forecasted expected rates of return for the approximate duration of the company’s benefit obligations using capital market data and historical relationships 

 

the discount rate is chosen as the rate at which pension obligations could be effectively settled and is based on capital market conditions as of the measurement date we have matched the timing and duration of the expected cash flows of our pension obligations to a yield curve generated from a broad portfolio of highquality fixed income debt instruments to select our discount rate based upon this cash flow matching analysis we selected a weighted average discount rate for the plans of 574 at december 31 2010 

 

net periodic benefit cost for our defined benefit pension plans was 219 million 73 million and 469 million for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the decreasing trend in pension cost from 2008 to 2009 was primarily due to the curtailment and subsequent remeasurement which is discussed below and the change in assumptions for the rate of return on plan assets the discount rate and the rate of compensation increases refer to note 7 of the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding employee benefit plans 

 

in april 2009 the company recorded a 43 million noncash curtailment adjustment in connection with a reorganization which reduced the expected years of future service of employees covered by the us defined benefit pension plan 

 

in july 2009 the company announced changes to the us postretirement benefit plan effective january 1 2010 future retirees no longer receive employerprovided medical benefits and current pre65 retirees no longer receive employerprovided post65 benefits beyond an accessonly arrangement 

quarterly results of operations 

 

the following is a summary of the quarterly results of operations for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 

 

 

 

we recorded the quarterly earnings per share amounts as if each quarter was a discrete period as a result the sum of the basic and diluted earnings per share will not necessarily total the annual basic and diluted earnings per share 

 

the preparation of interim consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the amounts reported in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements specifically the company makes estimates and assumptions in its interim consolidated financial statements for the accrual of bad debts inventory adjustments and discount and volume incentives earned among others bad debts are accrued based on a percentage of sales and volume incentives are estimated based upon cumulative and projected purchasing levels inventory adjustments are accrued on an interim basis and adjusted in the fourth quarter based on the annual october 31 booktophysical inventory adjustment the methodology and practices used in deriving estimates and assumptions for interim reporting typically results in adjustments upon accurate determination at yearend the effect of these adjustments in 2010 and 2009 was not significant

overview 

 

genuine parts company is a service organization engaged in the distribution of automotive replacement parts industrial replacement parts office products and electricalelectronic materials the company has a long tradition of growth dating back to 1928 the year we were founded in atlanta georgia in 2010 the company conducted business throughout the united states canada mexico and puerto rico from approximately 2000 locations 

 

we recorded consolidated net sales of 112 billion for the year ended december 31 2010 an increase of 11 compared to 101 billion in 2009 consolidated net income for the year ended december 31 2010 was 476 million up 19 from 400 million in 2009 the improving market conditions in the industries that we serve combined with our internal growth initiatives drove the company’s strong performance in 2010 

 

the 11 sales growth in 2010 follows a 9 decrease in revenues in 2009 and a 2 increase in revenues in 2008 our 19 increase in net income follows a 16 and 6 decrease in net income in 2009 and 2008 respectively throughout this three year period the company has implemented a variety of initiatives in each of our four business segments to grow sales and earnings including the introduction of new and expanded product lines geographic expansion including acquisitions sales to new markets enhanced customer marketing programs and a variety of gross margin and cost savings initiatives the effects of the economic slowdown which we began to experience in the final quarter of 2008 adversely impacted the benefit of these initiatives through 2009 in 2010 however the recovering economy served to further support the benefits of our internal growth initiatives 

 

with regard to the december 31 2010 consolidated balance sheet the company’s cash balance of 530 million was up 193 million or 57 from 337 million at december 31 2009 this increase marks the second consecutive year the company has significantly improved its cash position and relates to the increase in net income in 2010 and an improved working capital position for both years accounts receivable increased by approximately 15 

relatively inline with our sales increase in the fourth quarter of the year and inventory was up slightly including acquisitions accounts payable increased 281 million or 26 from the prior year due primarily to improved payment terms with certain suppliers and other ongoing payables initiatives such as a procurement card program total debt outstanding at december 31 2010 was unchanged from 500 million at december 31 2009 

 

results of operations 

 

our results of operations are summarized below for the three years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

 

 

net sales 

 

consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31 2010 totaled 112 billion an 11 increase from 2009 driven by sales growth in all four of our business segments the industrial and electrical business segments experienced the greatest percentage increases for the year as the manufacturing sector of the economy was much stronger in 2010 relative to 2009 these businesses also benefited from acquisitions in 2010 sales for the automotive business segment were much improved in 2010 as well primarily due to the benefits of well executed internal initiatives and the overall improvement in the economy cumulatively prices in 2010 were up approximately 1 in the automotive segment up approximately 3 in the industrial segment up approximately 4 in the electrical segment and approximately flat in the office segment 

 

consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31 2009 totaled 101 billion a 9 decrease from 2008 each of our four businesses experienced sales decreases with the industrial and electrical business segments showing the most significant declines as the manufacturing sector of the economy was severely impacted by the weak economic conditions which we began to experience in the latter part of 2008 the general weakness in demand resulting from lower consumer spending and industrial production and higher unemployment appeared to stabilize over the last half of 2009 among the four quarters in 2009 the fourth quarter was the strongest period for sales in each business segment cumulatively prices in 2009 were down approximately 3 in the automotive segment approximately flat in the industrial segment and up approximately 4 in the office segment and 2 in the electrical segment 

 

automotive group 

 

net sales for the automotive group “automotive” were 56 billion in 2010 an increase of 7 from 2009 sales improved in 2010 due to the successful execution of our sales initiatives and the stronger economy which drove increased demand for automotive maintenance and supply items automotive revenues were up 6 in the first quarter followed by 7 increases in the second and third quarters and a 9 increase in the fourth quarter other factors impacting our automotive sales for the year include the effect of currency which positively impacted sales by approximately 2 

 

automotive sales were 52 billion in 2009 a decrease of 2 from 2008 sales were impacted by the soft economy in 2009 which reduced the overall level of consumer spending and specifically the demand for automotive maintenance and supply items the first half of the year proved to be the most challenging with automotive sales down 7 and 5 in the first and second quarters respectively sales were down 1 in the third quarter followed by a 6 increase in the fourth quarter other factors impacting our automotive sales for the year include acquisitions which had an approximately 1 positive effect on sales and the effect of currency which negatively impacted sales by approximately 2 

industrial group 

 

net sales for motion industries our industrial group “industrial” were 35 billion in 2010 an increase of 22 compared to 2009 several factors contributed to the sales increase for this group including the positive impact of their internal sales initiatives and the strong rebound in the manufacturing sector of the economy served by industrial this was evidenced by the ongoing improvement in the manufacturing industrial production and capacity utilization indices which this group tends to track also in 2010 sales were positively impacted by acquisitions which accounted for approximately 5 of industrial’s sales growth for the year as a result of these several factors industrial revenues were up 9 in the first quarter of 2010 up 26 in the second quarter then up 29 and 24 in the third and fourth quarters respectively 

 

net sales were 29 billion in 2009 a decrease of 18 compared to 2008 through the first three quarters of the year sales were especially weak for this group due to the effects of very low manufacturing activity as evidenced by the reported levels of manufacturing industrial production and capacity utilization and its negative impact on demand for industrial products this weakness was widespread as we experienced sales declines in nearly all of our major customer categories the industrial indices we follow showed some early signs of stabilization in the third quarter and we observed a slight strengthening in these indicators as we entered the fourth quarter industrial sales were down 11 in the fourth quarter which marked a significant improvement from the declines of the first three quarters of the year in 2009 sales were positively impacted by several acquisitions which contributed approximately 3 to sales for the year 

 

office group 

 

net sales for sp richards our office products group “office” were 16 billion in 2010 up slightly compared to the prior year office revenues stabilized in 2010 relative to prior year trends although the office products industry continued to experience soft market conditions throughout the year as a result of reduced business spending and the ongoing impact of elevated unemployment levels sales decreased approximately 1 in the first and second quarters were flat in the third quarter and were up by 3 in the fourth quarter of 2010 the fourth quarter increase is significant as the industrywide slowdown in office products consumption has pressured this group for several years and the fourth quarter of 2010 marks the first positive sales comparison for office since the second quarter of 2007 

 

net sales were 16 billion in 2009 down 5 compared to 2008 and the third consecutive year of decreased revenues for office this three year sales trend reflects the negative impact of higher white collar and service unemployment on office products consumption which has affected the office products industry since 2007 in 2009 sales improved sequentially with decreases of 7 6 5 and 4 in the first second third and fourth quarters respectively for the year sales were positively impacted by three acquisitions completed in 2008 which contributed nearly 3 to sales in office the increase in net sales due to acquisitions as well as our sales initiatives was more than offset by the prevailing poor conditions in the office products industry 

 

electrical group 

 

net sales for eis our electrical and electronic group “electrical” increased to 450 million in 2010 up 30 from 2009 electrical sales increased by 16 in the first quarter and this was followed by increases of 32 in the second quarter 31 in the third quarter and 40 in the fourth quarter the revenue growth in 2010 was driven by our sales initiatives which were strongly supported by manufacturing expansion during the year as measured by the institute for supply management’s purchasing managers index in addition acquisitions in 2010 contributed approximately 9 to electrical’s sales growth for the year 

 

net sales decreased to 346 million in 2009 down 26 from 2008 electrical sales declined by 25 in the first quarter 34 in the second quarter and 30 in the third quarter for the fourth quarter sales were down 12 manufacturing contraction as measured by the institute for supply management’s purchasing managers index was evident through june and then began to stabilize and improve over the last half of the year this factor explains the quarterly sales trends at electrical in 2009 acquisitions had less than a 1 positive impact on electrical sales in 2009 

cost of goods sold 

 

cost of goods sold was 80 billion 70 billion and 77 billion in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the 13 increase in cost of goods sold from 2009 to 2010 is directly related to the sales increase for the same period cost of goods sold represented 710 of net sales in 2010 701 of net sales in 2009 and 703 of net sales in 2008 the increase in cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales in 2010 relative to 2009 and 2008 reflects the impact of certain pricing adjustments implemented in automotive during 2009 as well as ongoing competitive pricing pressures in office these factors more than offset our gross margin initiatives to enhance our pricing strategies promote and sell higher margin products and minimize material acquisition costs 

 

in 2010 all four of our business segments experienced vendor price increases although the automotive and office increases were relatively immaterial in 2009 our office and electrical business segments experienced vendor price increases industrial was flat and automotive pricing was down for the year in 2008 all four of our business segments experienced vendor price increases in any year where we experience price increases we are able to work with our customers to pass most of these along to them 

 

operating expenses 

 

selling administrative and other expenses “sga” increased by 147 million or 7 to 24 billion in 2010 representing 211 of net sales and down from 221 of net sales in 2009 sga expenses as a percentage of net sales improved from the prior year due primarily to the benefit of greater expense leverage associated with the 11 sales increase for the year in addition management’s ongoing cost control measures in areas such as personnel freight fleet and logistics have served to further improve the company’s cost structure after reducing the size of its workforce by approximately 12 during 2008 and 2009 the company added back only 1 of that in 2010 including acquisitions despite the 11 increase in revenues in total of the estimated 70 million cost savings in 2009 the company estimates that it added back approximately 20 million in costs in 2010 primarily associated with the increase in sales and earnings our management teams remain focused on the ongoing assessment of the appropriate cost structure in our businesses depreciation and amortization expense in 2010 was 89 million down slightly from 2009 the provision for doubtful accounts was 11 million in 2010 down 61 from 28 million in 2009 the decrease in bad debt expense reflects a much improved collections environment in 2010 relative to the prior year we believe the company is adequately reserved for bad debts at december 31 2010 

 

in 2009 sga was 22 billion down 140 million or 6 from 2008 and representing 221 of net sales this compared to 214 of net sales in 2008 this percentage increase was primarily due to the loss of expense leverage associated with the 9 sales decrease for the year during 2009 management implemented extensive cost control initiatives to offset this loss of leverage these measures eliminated approximately 70 million in operating costs and helped drive the decrease in absolute sga dollars for the year depreciation and amortization expense in 2009 was 90 million up slightly from 2008 the provision for doubtful accounts was 28 million in 2009 up 17 from a 24 million bad debt expense in 2008 

 

total sharebased compensation expense for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 was 70 million 86 million and 130 million respectively refer to note 5 of the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding sharebased compensation 

 

nonoperating expenses and income 

 

nonoperating expenses consist primarily of interest interest expense was 28 million in 2010 and 2009 and 32 million in 2008 the decrease in expense relative to 2008 is the result of an improved interest rate on certain longterm debt effective november 2008 

 

in “other” interest income net of noncontrolling interests has increased in each of the last two years due primarily to our improved cash position and the elimination of certain noncontrolling interests in 2009 

 

income before income taxes 

 

income before income taxes was 762 million in 2010 an increase of 183 from 644 million in 2009 as a percentage of net sales income before income taxes was 68 in 2010 reflecting an increase from 64 in 2009 in 

2009 income before income taxes of 644 million was down 160 from 768 million in 2008 and as a percentage of net sales was 64 a decrease from 70 in 2008 

 

automotive group 

 

automotive income before income taxes as a percentage of net sales which we refer to as operating margin increased to 75 in 2010 from 74 in 2009 the improvement in operating margin for 2010 is attributed to the benefit of greater expense leverage associated with automotive’s 7 sales increase for the year automotive’s initiatives to grow sales and control costs are intended to further improve its operating margin in the years ahead 

 

automotive’s operating margin increased to 74 in 2009 from 72 in 2008 the improvement in operating margin for 2009 is attributed to the benefit of cost reduction measures implemented during 2008 and 2009 

 

industrial group 

 

industrial’s operating margin increased to 73 in 2010 from 56 in 2009 the increase in operating margin in 2010 is due to the combination of greater expense leverage associated with a 22 sales increase cost savings and increased volume incentives industrial will continue to focus on its sales initiatives and cost controls to further improve its operating margin in the years ahead 

 

industrial’s operating margin decreased to 56 in 2009 from 84 in 2008 the decrease in operating margin in 2009 was primarily a reflection of the extreme downturn in industrial demand that we began to experience in the fourth quarter of 2008 these conditions led to lower sales volumes in 2009 which severely impacted our expense leverage despite significant cost reduction efforts 

 

office group 

 

the operating margin in office increased to 80 in 2010 from 77 in 2009 the increase in operating margin in 2010 reflects the positive impact of our cost savings initiatives combined with the benefit of higher volume incentives from suppliers the increase in incentives was due to our fourth quarter sales growth and related increase in purchase volumes which allowed us to achieve higher program growth tiers with suppliers 

 

the operating margin in office was 77 in 2009 down from 83 in 2008 the prevailing weakness in the office products industry that began in 2007 continued to pressure the operating margin at office in 2009 

 

electrical group 

 

the operating margin in electrical decreased to 69 in 2010 from 73 in 2009 the decrease in operating margin is mainly due to escalating copper prices during the year which generally do not affect profit dollars but negatively impact margins as copper is generally billed to customers at cost the margin pressures associated with this industry standard pricing practice for copper more than offset the benefits of a stronger manufacturing sector in 2010 and greater expense leverage associated with a 30 sales increase 

 

the operating margin in electrical decreased to 73 in 2009 from 79 in 2008 the decrease in operating margin was primarily a function of weak market conditions this factor outweighed the benefits of electrical’s sales initiatives and expense savings 

 

income taxes 

 

the effective income tax rate of 376 in 2010 was down from 380 in 2009 the decrease from 2009 is attributable to favorable foreign income taxes for the year the income tax rate decreased to 380 in 2009 from 381 in 2008 the decrease from the 2008 rate is mainly due to taxfree income in 2009 associated with a company retirement plan 

net income 

 

net income was 476 million in 2010 an increase of 19 from 400 million in 2009 on a per share diluted basis net income was 300 in 2010 compared to 250 in 2009 up 20 net income in 2010 was 42 of net sales compared to 40 of net sales in 2009 

 

net income of 400 million in 2009 was down 16 from 475 million in 2008 on a per share diluted basis net income of 250 in 2009 was down 14 compared to 292 in 2008 net income in 2009 was 40 of net sales compared to 43 of net sales in 2008 

 

financial condition 

 

our cash balance of 530 million at december 31 2010 was up 193 million or 57 from december 31 2009 due primarily to the increase in net income in 2010 and an improved working capital position relative to 2009 the company’s accounts receivable balance at december 31 2010 increased by approximately 15 from the prior year which reflects the company’s 14 sales increase for the fourth quarter of 2010 inventory at december 31 2010 was up slightly from december 31 2009 which is well below the company’s increase in sales and primarily attributable to acquisitions accounts payable increased 281 million or approximately 26 from december 31 2009 due primarily to increased inventory purchases related to the company’s sales increase improved payment terms with certain suppliers and other payables initiatives such as the ongoing expansion of our procurement card program goodwill and other intangible assets increased by 38 million or 22 from december 31 2009 due to the company’s acquisitions during the year the change in our december 31 2010 balance for the pension and other postretirement benefits liabilities down 41 million or approximately 14 from december 31 2009 is primarily due to a change in funded status of the company’s pension and other postretirement plans in 2010 and a 91 million pension contribution during the year 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

the company’s sources of capital consist primarily of cash flows from operations supplemented as necessary by private issuances of debt and bank borrowings we have 500 million of total debt outstanding at december 31 2010 of which 250 million matures in november 2011 and is accounted for as current debt at december 31 2010 the remaining 250 million matures in november 2013 in addition the company has available a 350 million unsecured revolving line of credit no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit at december 31 2010 and 2009 the capital and credit markets were volatile over the last few years although these conditions did not materially impact our access to these markets currently we believe that our cash on hand and available shortterm and longterm sources of capital are sufficient to fund the company’s operations including working capital requirements scheduled debt payments interest payments capital expenditures benefit plan contributions income tax obligations dividends share repurchases and contemplated acquisitions 

 

the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 22 to 1 at december 31 2010 and before consideration of current debt was 26 to 1 this compares to 29 to 1 at december 31 2009 our liquidity position remains solid the company’s 500 million in total debt outstanding at december 31 2010 is unchanged from 2009 

 

sources and uses of net cash 

 

a summary of the company’s consolidated statements of cash flows is as follows 

 

 

net cash provided by operating activities 

 

the company continues to generate cash and net cash provided by operating activities totaled 679 million in 2010 this reflects a 20 decrease from 2009 as working capital as a source of cash was 129 million less in 2010 relative to 2009 and pension contributions in 2010 increased by 35 million from 2009 these items were partially offset by a 76 million increase in net income net cash provided by operating activities of 845 million in 2009 represents a 59 increase from 2008 and primarily relates to the 368 million net decrease in cash used for working capital requirements including accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable net of the 76 million decrease in net income from 2008 

 

net cash used in investing activities 

 

net cash flow used in investing activities was 172 million in 2010 compared to 264 million in 2009 a decrease of 35 cash used for acquisitions of businesses in 2010 was 44 million less than in 2009 while capital expenditures increased by 16 million for the year the decrease in investing activities was primarily due to a 73 million purchase of properties under a construction and lease agreement in 2009 this transaction also explains the increase in investing activities in 2009 from 2008 net of a 36 million decrease in capital expenditures in 2009 from 2008 cash used for acquisitions of businesses in 2009 was relatively consistent with 2008 

 

net cash used in financing activities 

 

the company used 321 million of cash in financing activities in 2010 a 3 decrease from the 330 million used in financing activities in 2009 cash used in financing activities in 2009 was down 30 from the 473 million used in 2008 for the three years presented net cash used in financing activities was primarily for dividends paid to shareholders and repurchases of the company’s common stock the company paid dividends to shareholders of 258 million 254 million and 252 million during 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the company expects this trend of increasing dividends to continue in the foreseeable future during 2010 2009 and 2008 the company repurchased 75 million 26 million and 273 million respectively of the company’s common stock we expect to remain active in our share repurchase program but the amount and value of shares repurchased will vary annually 

 

notes and other borrowings 

 

the company maintains a 350 million unsecured revolving line of credit with a consortium of financial institutions which matures in december 2012 and bears interest at libor plus 30 056 at december 31 2010 at december 31 2010 and 2009 no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit due to the workers’ compensation and insurance reserve requirements in certain states the company also had unused letters of credit of approximately 50 million outstanding at december 31 2010 and 2009 

 

at december 31 2010 the company had unsecured senior notes outstanding under a 500 million financing arrangement as follows 250 million series b 623 fixed due 2011 and 250 million senior unsecured note 467 fixed due 2013 these borrowings contain covenants related to a maximum debttocapitalization ratio and certain limitations on additional borrowings at december 31 2010 the company was in compliance with all such covenants the weighted average interest rate on the company’s outstanding borrowings was approximately 545 at december 31 2010 and 2009 total interest expense net of interest income for all borrowings was 266 million 271 million and 298 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

contractual and other obligations 

 

in october 2007 the company entered into a saleleaseback transaction with a financial institution in connection with the transaction the company sold certain automotive retail store properties and immediately leased the properties back over a lease term of twenty years the lease was classified as an operating lease net proceeds from the transaction amounted to approximately 56 million the company realized a net gain of approximately 20 million which was deferred and is being amortized over the lease term 

the following table shows the company’s approximate obligations and commitments including interest due on credit facilities to make future payments under specified contractual obligations as of december 31 2010 

 

contractual obligations 

 

 

 

due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with the company’s unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2010 the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities therefore 50 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above refer to note 6 of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes 

 

purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in our estimates we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements our purchase orders are based on our current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons the company does not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements 

 

the company guarantees the borrowings of certain independently owned automotive parts stores independents and certain other affiliates in which the company has a noncontrolling equity ownership interest affiliates the company’s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these independents and affiliates is generally equal to the total borrowings subject to the company’s guarantee to date the company has had no significant losses in connection with guarantees of independents’ and affiliates’ borrowings the following table shows the company’s approximate commercial commitments as of december 31 2010 

 

other commercial commitments 

 

 

 

in addition the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans that may obligate us to make contributions to the plans from time to time contributions in 2010 were 91 million we expect to make a 52 million cash contribution to our qualified defined benefit plans in 2011 and contributions required for 2011 and future years will depend on a number of unpredictable factors including the market performance of the plans’ assets and future changes in interest rates that affect the actuarial measurement of the plans’ obligations 

 

share repurchases 

 

in 2010 the company repurchased approximately 18 million shares and the company had remaining authority to purchase approximately 160 million shares at december 31 2010 

critical accounting policies 

 

general 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

 

we describe in this section certain critical accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates assumptions and judgments an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially impact the consolidated financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for further information on the critical accounting policies see note 1 of the consolidated financial statements 

 

inventories — provisions for slow moving and obsolescence 

 

the company identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates appropriate loss provisions related thereto historically these loss provisions have not been significant as the vast majority of the company’s inventories are not highly susceptible to obsolescence and are eligible for return under various vendor return programs while the company has no reason to believe its inventory return privileges will be discontinued in the future its risk of loss associated with obsolete or slow moving inventories would increase if such were to occur 

 

allowance for doubtful accounts — methodology 

 

the company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors initially the company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on historical bad debt experience this initial estimate is periodically adjusted when the company becomes aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations eg bankruptcy filing or as a result of changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable while the company has a large customer base that is geographically dispersed a general economic downturn in any of the industry segments in which the company operates could result in higher than expected defaults and therefore the need to revise estimates for bad debts for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 the company recorded provisions for bad debts of 106 million 285 million and 239 million respectively 

 

consideration received from vendors 

 

the company enters into agreements at the beginning of each year with many of its vendors that provide for inventory purchase incentives generally the company earns inventory purchase incentives upon achieving specified volume purchasing levels or other criteria the company accrues for the receipt of these incentives as part of its inventory cost based on cumulative purchases of inventory to date and projected inventory purchases through the end of the year while management believes the company will continue to receive consideration from vendors in 2011 and beyond there can be no assurance that vendors will continue to provide comparable amounts of incentives in the future or that we will be able to achieve the specified volumes necessary to take advantage of such incentives 

impairment of property plant and equipment and goodwill and other intangible assets 

 

at least annually the company evaluates property plant and equipment goodwill and other intangible assets for potential impairment indicators the company’s judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance among other factors future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired evaluating for impairment also requires the company to estimate future operating results and cash flows which require judgment by management any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

 

employee benefit plans 

 

the company’s benefit plan committees in the us and canada establish investment policies and strategies and regularly monitor the performance of the company’s pension plan assets the pension plan investment strategy implemented by the company’s management is to achieve longterm objectives and invest the pension assets in accordance with the applicable pension legislation in the us and canada and fiduciary standards the longterm primary objectives for the pension plan funds are to provide for a reasonable amount of longterm growth of capital without undue exposure to risk protect the assets from erosion of purchasing power and provide investment results that meet or exceed the pension plan’s actuarially assumed long term rate of return the company’s investment strategy with respect to pension plan assets is to generate a return in excess of the passive portfolio benchmark 50 sp 500 index 5 russell mid cap index 10 russell 2000 index 5 msci eafe index and 30 barcap us govtcredit 

 

we make several critical assumptions in determining our pension plan liabilities and related pension expense we believe the most critical of these assumptions are the expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate other assumptions we make relate to employee demographic factors such as rate of compensation increases mortality rates retirement patterns and turnover rates 

 

based on the investment policy for the pension plans as well as an asset study that was performed based on the company’s asset allocations and future expectations the company’s expected rate of return on plan assets for measuring 2011 pension expense or income is 787 for the plans the asset study forecasted expected rates of return for the approximate duration of the company’s benefit obligations using capital market data and historical relationships 

 

the discount rate is chosen as the rate at which pension obligations could be effectively settled and is based on capital market conditions as of the measurement date we have matched the timing and duration of the expected cash flows of our pension obligations to a yield curve generated from a broad portfolio of highquality fixed income debt instruments to select our discount rate based upon this cash flow matching analysis we selected a weighted average discount rate for the plans of 574 at december 31 2010 

 

net periodic benefit cost for our defined benefit pension plans was 219 million 73 million and 469 million for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the decreasing trend in pension cost from 2008 to 2009 was primarily due to the curtailment and subsequent remeasurement which is discussed below and the change in assumptions for the rate of return on plan assets the discount rate and the rate of compensation increases refer to note 7 of the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding employee benefit plans 

 

in april 2009 the company recorded a 43 million noncash curtailment adjustment in connection with a reorganization which reduced the expected years of future service of employees covered by the us defined benefit pension plan 

 

in july 2009 the company announced changes to the us postretirement benefit plan effective january 1 2010 future retirees no longer receive employerprovided medical benefits and current pre65 retirees no longer receive employerprovided post65 benefits beyond an accessonly arrangement 

quarterly results of operations 

 

the following is a summary of the quarterly results of operations for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 

 

 

 

we recorded the quarterly earnings per share amounts as if each quarter was a discrete period as a result the sum of the basic and diluted earnings per share will not necessarily total the annual basic and diluted earnings per share 

 

the preparation of interim consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the amounts reported in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements specifically the company makes estimates and assumptions in its interim consolidated financial statements for the accrual of bad debts inventory adjustments and discount and volume incentives earned among others bad debts are accrued based on a percentage of sales and volume incentives are estimated based upon cumulative and projected purchasing levels inventory adjustments are accrued on an interim basis and adjusted in the fourth quarter based on the annual october 31 booktophysical inventory adjustment the methodology and practices used in deriving estimates and assumptions for interim reporting typically results in adjustments upon accurate determination at yearend the effect of these adjustments in 2010 and 2009 was not significant 




 item 7a    quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  tableend  

although the company does not face material risks related to interest rates and commodity prices the company is exposed to changes in foreign currency rates with respect to foreign currency denominated operating revenues and expenses 

 

foreign currency 

 

the company has translation gains or losses that result from translation of the results of operations of an operating unit’s foreign functional currency into us dollars for consolidated financial statement purposes the company’s principal foreign currency exchange exposure is the canadian dollar which is the functional currency of our canadian operations foreign currency exchange exposure particularly in regard to the canadian dollar and to a lesser extent the mexican peso positively impacted our results for the year ended december 31 2010 

 

during 2010 and 2009 it was estimated that a 10 shift in exchange rates between those foreign functional currencies and the us dollar would have impacted translated net sales by approximately 140 million and 104 million respectively

service to napa auto parts stores  the company believes that the quality and the range of services provided to its automotive parts customers constitute a significant advantage for its automotive parts distribution system such services include fast and frequent delivery obsolescence protection parts cataloging including the use of electronic napa auto parts catalogs and stock adjustment through a continuing parts classification system which allows independent retailers “jobbers” to return certain merchandise on a scheduled basis the company offers its napa auto parts store customers various management aids marketing aids and service on topics such as inventory control cost analysis accounting procedures group insurance and retirement benefit plans as well as marketing conferences and seminars sales and advertising manuals and training programs point of saleinventory management is available through tams ® total automotive management systems a computer system designed and developed by the company for the napa auto parts stores 

 

in association with napa the company has developed and refined an inventory classification system to determine optimum distribution center and auto parts store inventory levels for automotive parts stocking based on automotive registrations usage rates production statistics technological advances and other similar factors this system which undergoes continuous analytical review is an integral part of the company’s inventory control procedures and comprises an important feature of the inventory management services that the company makes available to its napa auto parts store customers over the last 10 years losses to the company from obsolescence have been insignificant and the company attributes this to the successful operation of its classification system which involves product return privileges with most of its suppliers

 item 1a    risk factors  tableend  

set forth below are some risks and uncertainties that if they were to occur could materially and adversely affect our business or could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements in this report and in the other public statements we make these risks are not exclusive and additional risks to which we are subject to include but are not limited to the risks of our businesses described elsewhere in this report 

 

we depend on our relationships with our vendors and a disruption of our vendor relationships or a disruption in our vendors’ operations could harm our business 

 

as a distributor of automotive replacement parts industrial parts office products and electricalelectronic materials our business depends on developing and maintaining close and productive relationships with our vendors we depend on our vendors to sell us quality products at favorable prices many factors outside our control may harm our relationships with our vendors for example financial or operational difficulties with a vendor could cause that vendor to increase the cost of the products we purchase from it vendor consolidation could also limit the number of suppliers from which we may purchase products and could materially affect the prices we pay for these products also consolidation among automotive parts industrial parts or office product suppliers could disrupt our relationship with some vendors in our automotive business the number of vendors could decrease considerably and the prices charged to us by the remaining vendors could increase as vehicle production slows due to the decline in consumer spending and possibly the failure of one or more of the large automobile manufacturers we would suffer an adverse impact if our vendors limit or cancel the return privileges that currently protect us from inventory obsolescence a disruption of our vendor relationships or a disruption in our vendors’ operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 

our business likely will continue to be impacted by difficult economic conditions 

 

our business and results of operations may continue to be adversely impacted by difficult global national and local economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer commercial and industrial spending these economic conditions began to significantly deteriorate in the fourth quarter of 2008 some of the factors that have contributed to reduced levels of spending include conditions in the residential real estate and mortgage markets conditions in the automobile industry variability in fuel and other energy costs labor and healthcare costs access to credit high unemployment rates low consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors these factors had a material adverse effect on demand for the company’s products and services and on the company’s financial condition and operating results in 2009 continued recessionary conditions could result in additional job losses and business failures which could result in a decrease in spending andor our loss of certain small business and retail customers in addition continued distress in global credit markets business failures and other recessionary conditions could have a material adverse effect on the ability of our suppliers to meet our inventory demands all of these macroeconomic conditions could adversely affect our sales growth margins and overhead which could adversely affect our financial condition and operations 

the current difficult economic climate has shown signs of stabilizing in recent months but is not expected to improve significantly in the near term the resulting low levels of consumer commercial and industrial spending could continue to result in weakened demand for the products of all of our business groups for the foreseeable future 

 

our business will be adversely affected if demand for our products slows 

 

our business depends on customer demand for the products that we distribute demand for these products depends on many factors 

 

with respect to our automotive group the primary factors are 

 

  

with respect to our industrial parts group the primary factors are 

 

  

with respect to our office products group the primary factors are 

 

  

with respect to our electricalelectronic materials group the primary factors are 

 

  

we face substantial competition in the industries in which we do business 

 

the sale of automotive and industrial parts office products and electronic materials is highly competitive and impacted by many factors including name recognition product availability customer service anticipating changing 

customer preferences store location and pricing pressures because we seek to offer competitive prices if our competitors reduce their prices we may be forced to reduce our prices which could result in a material decline in our revenues and earnings increased competition among distributors of automotive and industrial parts office products and electronic materials including internetrelated initiatives could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations the company anticipates no decline in competition in any of its four business segments in the foreseeable future 

 

in particular the market for replacement automotive parts is highly competitive and subjects us to a wide variety of competitors we compete primarily with national and regional auto parts chains independently owned regional and local automotive parts and accessories stores automobile dealers that supply manufacturer replacement parts and accessories mass merchandisers and wholesale clubs that sell automotive products and regional and local full service automotive repair shops if we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies including internet related initiatives or if our competitors develop more effective strategies we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

 

the impairment of financial institutions could adversely affect us 

 

the capital and credit markets have experienced varying levels of volatility and disruption for more than two years in late 2008 and early 2009 volatility and disruptions reached unprecedented levels we have exposure to counterparties with which we routinely execute transactions such counterparties include commercial banks insurance companies investment funds and other financial institutions some of which may be exposed to bankruptcy or liquidity risks while we have not realized any significant losses to date a bankruptcy or illiquidity event by one of our significant counterparties could materially and adversely affect our access to capital future business and results of operations

overview 

 

genuine parts company is a service organization engaged in the distribution of automotive replacement parts industrial replacement parts office products and electricalelectronic materials the company has a long tradition of growth dating back to 1928 the year we were founded in atlanta georgia in 2009 business was conducted throughout the united states puerto rico canada and mexico from approximately 2000 locations 

 

we recorded consolidated net sales of 101 billion for the year ended december 31 2009 a decrease of 9 compared to 110 billion in 2008 consolidated net income for the year ended december 31 2009 was 400 million down 16 from 475 million in 2008 the effects of the economic slowdown which we began to experience in the final quarter of 2008 adversely impacted the results in all four of our business segments throughout 2009 our businesses were impacted by the effects of reduced consumer spending lower levels of industrial production and higher unemployment which we discuss further below 

 

our 2009 revenue decrease of 9 follows a 2 and 4 increase in revenues in 2008 and 2007 respectively our 16 decrease in net income follows a 6 decrease in 2008 and a 7 increase in 2007 in each of the three years preceding 2007 the company had experienced doubledigit earnings growth throughout these periods the company has implemented a variety of initiatives in each of our four business segments to grow sales and earnings including the introduction of new and expanded product lines geographic expansion including acquisitions sales to new markets enhanced customer marketing programs and a variety of gross margin and cost savings initiatives the prevailing economic conditions of the last two years have offset these initiatives as reflected in our earnings for 2008 and 2009 

 

the following discussion addresses the major categories on the december 31 2009 consolidated balance sheet the company’s cash balance of 337 million was up 269 million from 68 million at december 31 2008 

this improvement is due mainly to the decrease in inventory and increase in accounts payable in 2009 relative to 2008 in addition we were less active in our share repurchase program during 2009 when compared to 2008 accounts receivable decreased by approximately 3 inventory was down by approximately 4 and accounts payable increased 85 million or 8 from the prior year due primarily to improved payment terms with certain suppliers and the ongoing expansion of our procurement card program total debt outstanding at december 31 2009 was unchanged from 500 million at december 31 2008 

 

results of operations 

 

our results of operations are summarized below for the three years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 

 

 

 

net sales 

 

consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31 2009 totaled 101 billion a 9 decrease from 2008 each of our four businesses experienced sales decreases with the industrial and electrical business segments showing the most significant declines as the manufacturing sector of the economy was severely impacted by the weak economic conditions of the last 15 months fortunately the general weakness in demand resulting from lower consumer spending and industrial production and higher unemployment seemed to stabilize over the last half of the year among the four quarters in 2009 the fourth quarter was the strongest period for sales in each business segment cumulatively prices in 2009 were down approximately 3 in the automotive segment approximately flat in the industrial segment and up approximately 4 in the office segment and 2 in the electrical segment 

 

consolidated sales for the year ended december 31 2008 totaled 110 billion a 2 increase from 2007 in 2008 the industrial and electrical business segments showed the strongest sales growth among our operations while the automotive and office segments continued to experience sluggish growth for the year automotive reported a slight sales increase while office reported a decrease in revenues for 2008 prices were up approximately 6 in the automotive segment 8 in the industrial and electrical segments and 4 in the office segment these price increases reflect the highest inflationary period for the company in many years 

 

automotive group 

 

net sales for the automotive group “automotive” were 52 billion in 2009 a decrease of 2 from 2008 sales were impacted by the soft economy which has reduced the overall level of consumer spending and specifically the demand for automotive maintenance and supply items the first half of the year proved to be the most challenging with automotive sales down 7 and 5 in the first and second quarters respectively sales were down 1 in the third quarter followed by a 6 increase in the fourth quarter other factors impacting our automotive sales for the year include acquisitions which had an approximately 1 positive effect on sales and the negative effect of currency which negatively impacted sales by approximately 2 

 

automotive sales were 53 billion in 2008 essentially flat compared to 2007 our rate of growth decreased during each quarter of the year from 3 to 2 to 1 in the first second and third quarters of 2008 respectively this downward trend was partly due to the impact of the decrease in miles driven caused by high gas prices over most of the year demand weakened further in the fourth quarter of 2008 as evidenced by the decrease in consumer spending resulting in a 6 sales decrease from the final quarter of 2007 this is consistent with historical patterns during a softening economy when consumers defer or forego discretionary spending on automotive maintenance and supply items other factors impacting our automotive sales for the year include acquisitions which had a slightly positive effect on sales 

industrial group 

 

net sales for motion industries our industrial group “industrial” were 29 billion in 2009 a decrease of 18 compared to 2008 through the first three quarters of the year sales were especially weak for this group due to the effects of very low manufacturing activity as evidenced by the reported levels of manufacturing industrial production and capacity utilization and its negative impact on demand for industrial products this weakness was widespread as we experienced sales declines in nearly all of our major customer categories the industrial indices we follow seemed to show some early signs of stabilization in the third quarter and we observed a slight strengthening in these indicators as we entered the fourth quarter industrial sales were down 11 in the fourth quarter which marks a significant improvement from the declines of the first three quarters of the year in 2009 sales were positively impacted by several acquisitions which accounted for approximately 3 of industrial’s sales growth for the year 

 

net sales were 35 billion in 2008 an increase of 5 compared to 2007 through the first three quarters of the year sales held strong and were relatively consistent from quarter to quarter increasing 6 in the first quarter and 7 in the second and third quarters the fourth quarter proved to be more difficult for this business due to the deteriorating economic environment including worsening manufacturing production trends and sales for the period were even with the fourth quarter of 2007 in 2008 sales were positively impacted by several acquisitions which accounted for nearly 2 of industrial’s sales for the year 

 

office group 

 

net sales for sp richards our office products group “office” were 16 billion in 2009 down 5 compared to the prior year 2009 represents the third consecutive year of decreased revenues for office and reflects the negative impact of higher white collar and service unemployment on office products consumption a trend that began in 2007 during the year sales improved sequentially with decreases of 7 6 5 and 4 in the first second third and fourth quarters respectively for the year sales were positively impacted by three acquisitions completed in 2008 which contributed nearly 3 to sales in office the increase in net sales due to acquisitions as well as our sales initiatives was more than offset by the prevailing poor conditions in the office products industry 

 

net sales for 2008 were 17 billion down 2 compared to 2007 this decline was indicative of the industrywide slowdown in office products consumption during the year sales were down 2 in the first quarter and even with the prior year periods in the second and third quarters demand in the fourth quarter worsened consistent with the significant increase in unemployment for the period and sales were down 5 from the 2007 fourth quarter for the year sales were positively impacted by three acquisitions which contributed nearly 2 to sales in office 

 

electrical group 

 

net sales for eis our electrical and electronic group “electrical” decreased to 346 million in 2009 down 26 from 2008 electrical sales declined by 25 in the first quarter 34 in the second quarter and 30 in the third quarter for the fourth quarter sales were down 12 manufacturing contraction as measured by the institute for supply management’s purchasing managers index was evident through june and then began to stabilize and improve over the last half of the year this factor which we deem as positive for 2010 helps explain the quarterly sales trends at electrical in 2009 acquisitions had less than a 1 positive impact on electrical sales in 2009 

 

net sales increased by 7 to 466 million in 2008 compared to 2007 electrical sales were strong through the first nine months of the year increasing 7 in the first quarter 11 in the second quarter and 13 in the third quarter the deteriorating economy had a significant impact on this business in the fourth quarter and sales decreased 4 from the same period in 2007 acquisitions during the year had a positive 2 impact on electrical sales in 2008 and combined with electrical’s sales initiatives partially offset the weakening conditions in the marketplace in the last quarter of the year 

 

cost of goods sold 

 

cost of goods sold was 70 billion 77 billion and 76 billion in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the 9 decrease in cost of goods sold from 2008 to 2009 is consistent with the sales decrease cost of goods sold 

represented 701 of net sales in 2009 and 703 of net sales in 2008 and 2007 the relatively constant rate over these three periods reflects how our ongoing gross margin initiatives to enhance our pricing strategies promote and sell higher margin products and minimize material acquisition costs were generally offset by increasing competitive pricing pressures in the markets we serve 

 

in 2009 our office and electrical business segments experienced vendor price increases industrial was flat and automotive pricing was down for the year in 2008 and 2007 all four of our business segments experienced vendor price increases in any year where we experience price increases we are able to work with our customers to pass most of these along to them 

 

operating expenses 

 

selling administrative and other expenses “sga” decreased by 140 million to 22 billion in 2009 representing 221 of net sales and up from 214 of net sales in 2008 sga expenses as a percentage of net sales increased from the prior year due primarily to the loss of expense leverage associated with the 9 sales decrease for the year during 2009 management continued its implementation of extensive cost control initiatives to offset this loss of leverage these measures emphasize continuous improvement programs designed to optimize our utilization of people and systems and for the year we eliminated approximately 70 million in operating costs examples of such savings include costs associated with personnel freight fleet and logistics among others the company reduced its workforce by 7 in 2009 before consideration of acquisitions and this follows a 5 reduction in employees in 2008 severance and other termination benefits associated with these employee reductions were insignificant our management teams remain focused on the ongoing assessment of the appropriate cost structure in our businesses and the need for additional cost reductions while maintaining our high standards for excellent customer service 

 

depreciation and amortization expense in 2009 was 90 million up slightly from 2008 the provision for doubtful accounts was 28 million in 2009 up from a 24 million bad debt expense in 2008 our bad debt expense reflects an increase in uncollectible accounts receivables in 2009 and is likely directly correlated to the ongoing effects of the difficult economic climate which has pressured certain of our customers we believe the company is adequately reserved for bad debts at december 31 2009 

 

in 2008 sga was 24 billion or 214 of net sales which was an increase from 2007 when sga as a percentage of net sales was 210 this increase was mainly due to the loss of leverage on the lower level of sales growth in 2008 relative to the prior year which offset the benefits of our ongoing cost control initiatives depreciation and amortization expense in 2008 was 89 million relatively consistent with 2007 the provision for doubtful accounts was 24 million in 2008 up from a 14 million bad debt expense in 2007 

 

total sharebased compensation expense for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 was 86 million 130 million and 143 million respectively refer to note 5 of the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding sharebased compensation 

 

nonoperating expenses and income 

 

nonoperating expenses consist primarily of interest interest expense was 28 million in 2009 a decrease from 32 million and 31 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively the decrease is the result of an improved interest rate on certain longterm debt effective november 2008 

 

in “other” interest income net of noncontrolling interests increased in 2009 from 2008 due primarily to the elimination of certain noncontrolling interests in 2009 in 2008 interest income net of noncontrolling interests decreased from 2007 due to the effects of lower interest rates 

 

income before income taxes 

 

income before income taxes was 644 million in 2009 a decrease of 160 from 768 million in 2008 as a percentage of net sales income before income taxes was 64 in 2009 reflecting a decrease from 70 in 2008 in 2008 income before income taxes of 768 million was down 59 from 817 million in 2007 and as a percentage of net sales was 70 a decrease from 75 in 2007 

automotive group 

 

automotive income before income taxes as a percentage of net sales which we refer to as operating margin increased to 74 in 2009 from 72 in 2008 the improvement in operating margin for 2009 is attributed to the benefit of cost reduction measures implemented during 2008 and 2009 automotive’s initiatives to grow sales and control costs are intended to improve its operating margin in the years ahead 

 

automotive operating margins decreased to 72 in 2008 from 78 in 2007 the decline in operating margin for 2008 is attributed to automotive’s lower sales volume for the year partially offset by the benefit of cost reduction measures 

 

industrial group 

 

industrial operating margins decreased to 56 in 2009 from 84 in 2008 and 2007 the decrease in operating margins in 2009 was primarily a reflection of the extreme downturn in industrial demand that we began to experience in the fourth quarter of 2008 these conditions led to lower levels of sales volume in 2009 which severely impacted our expense leverage despite our cost reduction efforts in addition the decrease in inventory purchases in 2009 a direct result of lower sales significantly reduced the level of volume incentives earned during the year these factors more than offset our sales initiatives and cost reduction efforts we will continue to focus on these areas however to show progress in the years ahead 

 

office group 

 

operating margins in office were 77 in 2009 down from 83 in 2008 and 89 in 2007 the prevailing weakness in the office products industry that began in 2007 continued to pressure the operating margins at office in 2009 the decrease in revenues for these three periods has negatively impacted our expense leverage our sales strategy remains to capture additional market share despite the industry slowdown 

 

electrical group 

 

operating margins in electrical decreased to 73 in 2009 from 79 in 2008 in 2008 the electrical operating margins had increased to 79 from 70 in 2007 and marked the fifth consecutive year of operating margin improvement for electrical in 2009 the decrease in operating margins was primarily a function of weak market conditions this factor outweighed the benefits of electrical’s sales initiatives and expense savings ongoing efforts in these areas as well as a more stable manufacturing sector will serve to improve electrical’s future operating margins 

 

income taxes 

 

the effective income tax rate decreased to 380 in 2009 from 381 in 2008 the decrease from the 2008 rate is mainly due to taxfree income in 2009 associated with a company retirement plan the 381 tax rate in 2008 had increased from 380 in 2007 the increase from the prior year rate was mainly due to a nondeductible expense associated with a company retirement plan 

 

net income 

 

net income was 400 million in 2009 a decrease of 16 from 475 million in 2008 on a per share diluted basis net income was 250 in 2009 compared to 292 in 2008 down 14 net income in 2009 was 40 of net sales compared to 43 of net sales in 2008 

 

net income was 475 million in 2008 a decrease of 6 from 506 million in 2007 on a per share diluted basis net income was 292 in 2008 compared to 298 in 2007 down 2 net income in 2008 was 43 of net sales compared to 47 of net sales in 2007 

financial condition 

 

the following is a discussion of the company’s financial condition at december 31 2009 our cash balance of 337 million was up 269 million from december 31 2008 due primarily to the decrease in inventory and increase in accounts payable in 2009 relative to 2008 in addition we were less active in our company share repurchase program in 2009 when compared to 2008 the company’s accounts receivable balance at december 31 2009 decreased by approximately 3 from the prior year and inventory at december 31 2009 was down by approximately 4 from december 31 2008 both of these decreases reflect our decline in sales for the year accounts payable increased 85 million or approximately 8 from december 31 2008 due primarily to improved payment terms with certain suppliers and the ongoing expansion of our procurement card program goodwill and other intangible assets increased by 13 million or 8 from december 31 2008 and relates primarily to the company’s acquisitions during the year the change in our december 31 2009 balances for deferred taxes down 51 million as well as pension and other postretirement benefits liabilities down 202 million is primarily due to a pension contribution of 53 million and a change in funded status of the company’s pension and other postretirement plans in 2009 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

the company’s sources of capital consist primarily of cash flows from operations supplemented as necessary by private issuances of debt and bank borrowings we have 500 million of longterm debt outstanding at december 31 2009 of which 250 million matures in 2011 and 250 million matures in 2013 the capital and credit markets continue to be volatile and if these conditions continue they are likely to impact our access to these markets currently we believe that our available shortterm and longterm sources of capital are sufficient to fund the company’s operations including working capital requirements scheduled debt payments interest payments capital expenditures benefit plan contributions income tax obligations dividends share repurchases and contemplated acquisitions 

 

the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 29 to 1 at december 31 2009 compared to 30 to 1 at december 31 2008 our liquidity position remains solid the company had 500 million in total debt outstanding at december 31 2009 and 2008 in addition at december 31 2009 the company had available a 350 million unsecured revolving line of credit no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit at december 31 2009 and 2008 

 

sources and uses of net cash 

 

a summary of the company’s consolidated statements of cash flows is as follows 

 

 

 

net cash provided by operating activities 

 

the company continues to generate cash and 2009 was an especially strong year with net cash provided by operating activities totaling 845 million in 2009 this represents a 59 increase from 2008 and primarily relates to the 368 million net decrease in cash used for working capital requirements including accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable net of the 76 million decrease in net income from 2008 the 17 decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2008 was primarily due to the 116 million net increase in cash used for working capital requirements including accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable as well as the 31 million decrease in net income from 2007 

net cash used in investing activities 

 

net cash flow used in investing activities was 264 million in 2009 compared to 214 million in 2008 an increase of 23 primarily the increase in investing activities was due to the 73 million used in 2009 for the purchase of properties under a construction and lease agreement net of the 36 million decrease in capital expenditures in 2009 from 2008 cash used for acquisitions of businesses in 2009 was relatively consistent with 2008 in 2008 the change in investing activities was primarily due to the 89 million increase in cash used for the acquisition of businesses in 2008 and the 56 million decrease in cash proceeds from the sale of assets during the year relative to 2007 

 

net cash used in financing activities 

 

the company used 330 million of cash in financing activities in 2009 a 30 decrease from the 473 million used in financing activities in 2008 cash used in financing activities in 2008 was relatively consistent with 2007 for the three years presented net cash used in financing activities was primarily for dividends paid to shareholders and the repurchase of the company’s common stock the company paid dividends to shareholders of 254 million 252 million and 243 million during 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the company expects this trend of increasing dividends to continue in the foreseeable future during 2009 2008 and 2007 the company repurchased 26 million 273 million and 241 million respectively of the company’s common stock we expect to remain active in our share repurchase program but the amount and value of shares repurchased will vary annually 

 

notes and other borrowings 

 

the company maintains a 350 million unsecured revolving line of credit with a consortium of financial institutions which matures in december 2012 and bears interest at libor plus 30 053 at december 31 2009 at december 31 2009 and 2008 no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit due to the workers compensation and insurance reserve requirements in certain states the company also had unused letters of credit of approximately 50 million and 51 million outstanding at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

at december 31 2009 the company had unsecured senior notes outstanding under a 500 million financing arrangement as follows 250 million series b 623 fixed due 2011 and 250 million senior unsecured note 467 fixed due 2013 certain borrowings contain covenants related to a maximum debttocapitalization ratio and certain limitations on additional borrowings at december 31 2009 the company was in compliance with all such covenants the weighted average interest rate on the company’s outstanding borrowings was approximately 545 at december 31 2009 and 2008 total interest expense net of interest income for all borrowings was 271 million 298 million and 211 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

construction and lease agreement 

 

the company had an 85 million construction and lease agreement with an unaffiliated third party which expired in 2009 under the agreement the third party constructed facilities and leased them to the company upon expiration of the agreement the company purchased the properties from the lessor for 73 million including closing costs which was paid in july 2009 these properties have been included in property plant and equipment in the consolidated balance sheet refer to note 4 of the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this arrangement 

 

contractual and other obligations 

 

in october 2007 the company entered into a saleleaseback transaction with a financial institution in connection with the transaction the company sold certain automotive retail store properties and immediately leased the properties back over a lease term of twenty years the lease was classified as an operating lease net proceeds from the transaction amounted to approximately 56 million the company realized a net gain of approximately 20 million which was deferred and is being amortized over the lease term 

the following table shows the company’s approximate obligations and commitments including interest due on credit facilities to make future payments under contractual obligations as of december 31 2009 

 

contractual obligations 

 

 

 

due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with the company’s unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2009 the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities therefore 41 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above refer to note 6 of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes 

 

purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in our estimates we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements our purchase orders are based on our current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons the company does not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements 

 

the company guarantees the borrowings of certain independently controlled automotive parts stores independents and certain other affiliates in which the company has a noncontrolling equity ownership interest affiliates the company’s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these independents and affiliates is equal to the total borrowings subject to the company’s guarantee to date the company has had no significant losses in connection with guarantees of independents’ and affiliates’ borrowings the following table shows the company’s approximate commercial commitments as of december 31 2009 

 

other commercial commitments 

 

 

 

in addition the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans that may obligate us to make contributions to the plans from time to time contributions in 2009 were 56 million contributions required for 2010 and future years will depend on a number of unpredictable factors including the market performance of the plans’ assets and future changes in interest rates that affect the actuarial measurement of the plans’ obligations 

 

share repurchases 

 

on august 21 2006 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of 15 million shares of our common stock and on november 17 2008 the board authorized the repurchase of an additional 15 million shares such 

repurchase plans were announced on august 21 2006 and november 17 2008 respectively the authorization for these repurchase plans continues until all such shares have been repurchased or the repurchase plan is terminated by action of the board of directors in 2009 the company repurchased approximately 722000 shares and the company had remaining authority to purchase approximately 178 million shares at december 31 2009 

 

critical accounting estimates 

 

general 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

 

we describe in this section certain critical accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates assumptions and judgments an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially impact the consolidated financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for further information on the critical accounting policies see note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

 

inventories — provisions for slow moving and obsolescence 

 

the company identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates appropriate loss provisions related thereto historically these loss provisions have not been significant as the vast majority of the company’s inventories are not highly susceptible to obsolescence and are eligible for return under various vendor return programs while the company has no reason to believe its inventory return privileges will be discontinued in the future its risk of loss associated with obsolete or slow moving inventories would increase if such were to occur 

 

allowance for doubtful accounts — methodology 

 

the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors initially the company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on historical bad debt experience this initial estimate is periodically adjusted when the company becomes aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations eg bankruptcy filing or as a result of changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable while the company has a large customer base that is geographically dispersed a general economic downturn in any of the industry segments in which the company operates could result in higher than expected defaults and therefore the need to revise estimates for bad debts for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 the company recorded provisions for bad debts of 285 million 239 million and 135 million respectively 

 

consideration received from vendors 

 

the company enters into agreements at the beginning of each year with many of its vendors providing for inventory purchase incentives and advertising allowances generally the company earns inventory purchase incentives upon achieving specified volume purchasing levels and advertising allowances upon fulfilling its obligations related to cooperative advertising programs the company accrues for the receipt of inventory purchase incentives as part of its inventory cost based on cumulative purchases of inventory to date and projected inventory purchases through the end of the year and in the case of advertising allowances upon completion of the company’s obligations related thereto while management believes the company will continue to receive such amounts in 2010 

and beyond there can be no assurance that vendors will continue to provide comparable amounts of incentives and allowances in the future 

 

impairment of property plant and equipment and goodwill and other intangible assets 

 

at least annually the company evaluates property plant and equipment goodwill and other intangible assets for potential impairment indicators the company’s judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance among other factors future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired evaluating for impairment also requires the company to estimate future operating results and cash flows which require judgment by management any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

 

employee benefit plans 

 

the company’s benefit plan committees in the us and canada establish investment policies and strategies and regularly monitor the performance of the company’s pension plan assets the pension plan investment strategy implemented by the company’s management is to achieve longterm objectives and invest the pension assets in accordance with the applicable pension legislation in the us and canada and fiduciary standards the longterm primary objectives for the pension plan funds are to provide for a reasonable amount of longterm growth of capital without undue exposure to risk protect the assets from erosion of purchasing power and provide investment results that meet or exceed the pension plan’s actuarially assumed long term rate of return the company’s investment strategy with respect to pension plan assets is to generate a return in excess of the passive portfolio benchmark 50 sp index 5 russell mid cap index 10 russell 2000 index 5 msci eafe index and 30 barcap us govtcredit 

 

we make several critical assumptions in determining our pension plan liabilities and related pension expense we believe the most critical of these assumptions are the expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate other assumptions we make relate to employee demographic factors such as rate of compensation increases mortality rates retirement patterns and turnover rates 

 

based on the investment policy for the pension plan as well as an asset study that was performed based on the company’s asset allocations and future expectations the company’s expected rate of return on plan assets for measuring 2010 pension expense or income is 800 for the plan the asset study forecasted expected rates of return for the approximate duration of the company’s benefit obligations using capital market data and historical relationships 

 

the discount rate is chosen as the rate at which pension obligations could be effectively settled and is based on capital market conditions as of the measurement date we have matched the timing and duration of the expected cash flows of our pension obligations to a yield curve generated from a broad portfolio of highquality fixed income debt instruments to select our discount rate based upon this cash flow matching analysis we selected a weighted average discount rate for the us plans of 654 at december 31 2009 

 

net periodic benefit cost for our defined benefit pension plans was 73 million 469 million and 512 million for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the decreasing trend in pension cost over these periods was primarily due to the curtailment and subsequent remeasurment which is discussed below and the change in assumptions for the rate of return on plan assets the discount rate and the rate of compensation increases refer to note 7 of the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding employee benefit plans 

 

in april 2009 the company recorded a 43 million noncash curtailment adjustment in connection with a reorganization which reduced the expected years of future service of employees covered by the us defined benefit pension plan 

 

in july 2009 the company announced changes to the us postretirement benefit plan effective january 1 2010 future retirees will no longer receive employerprovided medical benefits and current pre65 retirees will no longer receive employerprovided post65 benefits beyond an accessonly arrangement 

quarterly results of operations 

 

the following is a summary of the quarterly results of operations for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 

 

 

 

we recorded the quarterly earnings per share amounts as if each quarter was a discrete period as a result the sum of the basic and diluted earnings per share will not necessarily total the annual basic and diluted earnings per share 

 

the preparation of interim consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the amounts reported in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements specifically the company makes certain estimates in its interim consolidated financial statements for the accrual of bad debts inventory adjustments and discount and volume incentives earned bad debts are accrued based on a percentage of sales and volume incentives are estimated based upon cumulative and projected purchasing levels inventory adjustments are accrued on an interim basis and adjusted in the fourth quarter based on the annual october 31 booktophysical inventory adjustment the methodology and practices used in deriving estimates for interim reporting typically results in adjustments upon accurate determination at yearend the effect of these adjustments in 2009 and 2008 was not significant

 item 7a    quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  tableend  

although the company does not face material risks related to interest rates and commodity prices the company is exposed to changes in foreign currency rates with respect to foreign currency denominated operating revenues and expenses 

 

foreign currency 

 

the company has translation gains or losses that result from translation of the results of operations of an operating unit’s foreign functional currency into us dollars for consolidated financial statement purposes the company’s principal foreign currency exchange exposure is the canadian dollar which is the functional currency of our canadian operations foreign currency exchange exposure particularly in regard to the canadian dollar and to a lesser extent the mexican peso negatively impacted our results for the year ended december 31 2009 

 

during 2009 and 2008 it was estimated that a 10 shift in exchange rates between those foreign functional currencies and the us dollar would have impacted translated net sales by approximately 104 million and 118 million respectively

forwardlooking statements made herein as well as in materials we file with the sec or otherwise release to the public including materials that we make available on our website and verbal statements made by senior officers to analysts investors the media and others are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 forwardlooking statements are only as of the date they are made and the company undertakes no duty to update its forwardlooking statements except as required by law you are advised however to review any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our subsequent forms 10q 10k 8k and other reports to the sec 

 

we depend on our relationships with our vendors and a disruption of our vendor relationships or a disruption in our vendors’ operations could harm our business 

 

as a distributor of automotive replacement parts industrial parts office products and electricalelectronic materials our business depends on developing and maintaining close and productive relationships with our vendors we depend on our vendors to sell us quality products at favorable prices many factors outside our control may harm our relationships with our vendors for example financial or operational difficulties with a vendor could cause that vendor to increase the cost of the products we purchase from it vendor consolidation could also limit the number of suppliers from which we may purchase products and could materially affect the prices we pay for these products also consolidation among automotive parts or industrial parts and office product suppliers could disrupt our relationship with some vendors in our automotive business the number of vendors could decrease considerably and the prices charged to us by the remaining vendors could increase as vehicle production slows due to the decline in consumer spending and possibly the failure of one or more of the large automobile manufacturers we would suffer an adverse impact if our vendors limit or cancel the return privileges that currently protect us from inventory obsolescence a disruption of our vendor relationships or a disruption in our vendors’ operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 

our business likely will continue to be impacted by declining economic conditions 

 

our business and results of operations may continue to be adversely impacted by declining global national and local economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer commercial and industrial spending these economic conditions have deteriorated significantly in recent months some of the factors that have contributed to recent reduced levels of spending include conditions in the residential real estate and mortgage markets conditions in the automobile industry increases in fuel and other energy costs labor and healthcare costs access to credit high unemployment rates declining consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors these factors had a material adverse effect on demand for the company’s products and services and on the company’s financial condition and operating results in the fourth quarter of 2008 the current difficult economic climate is not expected to improve significantly in the near term and the resulting low levels of consumer commercial and industrial spending could continue to result in weakened demand for the products of all of our business groups for the foreseeable future 

our business will be adversely affected if demand for our products slows 

 

our business depends on customer demand for the products that we distribute demand for these products depends on many factors 

 

with respect to our automotive group the primary factors are 

 

  

with respect to our industrial parts group the primary factors are 

 

  

with respect to our office products group the primary factors are  

 

  

with respect to our electricalelectronic materials group the primary factors are 

 

  

we face substantial competition in the industries in which we do business 

 

the sale of automotive and industrial parts office products and electronic materials is highly competitive and impacted by many factors including name recognition product availability customer service anticipating changing customer preferences store location and pricing pressures because we seek to offer competitive prices if our competitors reduce their prices we may be forced to reduce our prices which could result in a material decline in our revenues and earnings increased competition among distributors of automotive and industrial parts office products and electronic materials including internetrelated initiatives could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

in particular the market for replacement automotive parts is highly competitive and subjects us to a wide variety of competitors we compete primarily with national and regional auto parts chains independently owned regional and local automotive parts and accessories stores automobile dealers that supply manufacturer replacement parts and accessories mass merchandisers and wholesale clubs that sell automotive products and regional and local full service automotive repair shops if we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies including internet related initiatives or if our competitors develop more effective strategies we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

 

the impairment of financial institutions could adversely affect us 

 

the capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption for more than twelve months in the past several months volatility and disruptions have increased and recently reached unprecedented levels we have exposure to counterparties with which we routinely execute transactions such counterparties include commercial banks insurance companies investment funds and other financial institutions some of which may be exposed to bankruptcy or liquidity risks while we have not realized any significant losses to date a bankruptcy or illiquidity event by one of our significant counterparties could materially and adversely affect our access to capital future business and results of operations

risks relating to our company 

we depend on our relationships with our vendors 

as a distributor of automotive replacement parts industrial parts office products and electricalelectronic materials our business depends on developing and maintaining close and productive relationships with our vendors we depend on our vendors to sell us quality products at favorable prices many factors outside our control may harm these relationships for example financial or operational difficulties with a vendor could cause that vendor to increase the cost of the products we purchase from it vendor consolidation could also limit the number of suppliers from which we may purchase products and could materially affect the prices we pay for these products also consolidation among automotive parts or industrial parts and office product suppliers could disrupt our relationship with some vendors a disruption of our vendor relationships or a disruption in our vendors’ operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

our business and results of operations could be impacted by certain laws 

div alignleft stylefontsize 10pt margintop


 6ptwe are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the operation of our business such as laws and regulations relating to environmental and employment matters as well as changes in accounting and taxation guidance because such laws and regulations are subject to change without notice we cannot anticipate the potential costs of compliance on the other hand if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions there can be no assurance that the cost of compliance or a material failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us in the future 

risks relating to our industry 

our business may be impacted by general economic conditions and local national and global events 

our business and results of operations also may be impacted by general economic conditions conditions in local markets or other factors that we cannot control including job growth and unemployment conditions industrial output and capacity and capital expenditures reduction in manufacturing capacity in our targeted geographic markets due to consolidation and the transfer of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries weather terrorist acts pricing pressures of our competitors and customers shortages of fuel or interruptions in transportation systems labor strikes work stoppages or other interruptions to or difficulties in the employment of labor in the major markets where we operate changes in interest rates inflation or currency exchange rates changes in accounting policies and practices and changes in regulatory policies and practices 

  

  our business may be materially affected if demand for our products slows 

our business depends on customer demand for the products that we distribute demand for these products depends on many factors with respect to our automotive group the primary factors are the number of miles vehicles are driven annually as higher vehicle mileage increases the need for maintenance and repair the quality of the vehicles manufactured by the original vehicle manufacturers and the length of the warranty or maintenance offered on new vehicles the number of vehicles in current service that are six years old and older as these vehicles are typically no longer under the original vehicle manufacturers’ warranty and will need more maintenance and repair than newer vehicles restrictions on access to diagnostic tools and repair information imposed by the original vehicle manufacturers or by governmental regulation and the economy generally 

we face substantial competition in the industries in which we do business 

the industries in which we do business are highly competitive the sale of automotive and industrial parts office products and electronic materials is highly competitive and impacted by many factors including name recognition product availability customer service anticipating changing customer preferences store location and pricing pressures increased competition among distributors of automotive and industrial parts office products and electronic materials including internetrelated initiatives could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

in particular the market for replacement automotive parts is highly competitive and subjects us to a wide variety of competitors we compete primarily with national and regional auto parts chains independently owned regional and local automotive parts and accessories stores automobile dealers that supply manufacturer replacement parts and accessories mass merchandisers and wholesale clubs that sell automotive products and regional and local full service automotive repair shops if we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies including internet related initiatives or if our competitors develop more effective strategies we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline

among the automotive lines that each napa member purchases and distributes are certain lines designated cataloged advertised and promoted as “napa” lines the members are not required to purchase any specific quantity of parts so designated and may and do purchase competitive lines from other supply sources 

the company and the other napa members use the federally registered trademark napa® as part of the trade name of their distribution centers and parts stores the company contributes to napa’s national advertising program which is designed to increase public recognition of the napa name and to promote napa product lines

risks relating to our company 

we depend on our relationships with our vendors 

as a distributor of automotive replacement parts industrial parts office products and electricalelectronic materials our business is dependent on developing and maintaining close and productive relationships with our vendors we depend on our vendors to sell us quality products at favorable prices many factors outside our control may harm these relationships for example financial or operational difficulties with a vendor could cause that vendor to increase the cost of the products we purchase from it vendor consolidation could also limit the number of suppliers from which we may purchase products and could materially affect the prices we pay for these products also consolidation among automotive parts or industrial parts and office product suppliers could disrupt our relationship with some vendors a disruption of our vendor relationships or a disruption in our vendors’ operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

our business and results of operations could be impacted by certain laws 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the operation of our business such as laws and regulations relating to environmental and employment matters as well as changes in accounting and taxation guidance because such laws and regulations are subject to change without notice we cannot anticipate the potential costs of compliance on the other hand if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions there can be no assurance that the cost of compliance or a material failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us in the future 

risks relating to our industry 

our business may be impacted by general economic conditions and local national and global events 

our business and results of operations also may be impacted by general economic conditions conditions in local markets or other factors that we cannot control including job growth and unemployment conditions industrial output and capacity and capital expenditures reduction in manufacturing capacity in our targeted geographic markets due to consolidation and the transfer of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries weather terrorist acts pricing pressures of our competitors and customers shortages of fuel or interruptions in transportation systems labor strikes work stoppages or other interruptions to or difficulties in the employment of labor in the major markets where we operate changes in interest rates inflation or currency exchange rates changes in accounting policies and practices and changes in regulatory policies and practices 

our business may be materially affected if demand for our products slows 

our business depends on customer demand for the products that we distribute demand for these products depends on many factors with respect to our automotive group the primary factors are the number of miles vehicles are driven annually as higher vehicle mileage increases the need for maintenance and repair the quality of the vehicles manufactured by the original vehicle manufacturers and the length of the warranty or maintenance offered on new vehicles the number of vehicles in current service that are six years old and older as these vehicles are typically no longer under the original vehicle manufacturers’ warranty and will need more maintenance and repair than newer vehicles restrictions on access to diagnostic tools and repair information imposed by the original vehicle manufacturers or by governmental regulation and the economy generally 

we face substantial competition in the industries in which we do business 

the industries in which we do business are highly competitive the sale of automotive and industrial parts office products and electronic materials is highly competitive and impacted by many factors including name recognition product availability customer service anticipating changing customer preferences store location and pricing pressures increased competition among distributors of automotive and industrial parts office products and electronic materials including internetrelated initiatives could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

in particular the market for replacement automotive parts is highly competitive and subjects us to a wide variety of competitors we compete primarily with national and regional auto parts chains independently owned automotive parts and accessories stores automobile dealers that supply manufacturer replacement parts and accessories mass merchandisers and wholesale clubs that sell automotive products and regional and local full service automotive repair shops if we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies or if our competitors develop more effective strategies we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline

overview 

genuine parts company is a service organization engaged in the distribution of automotive replacement parts industrial replacement parts office products and electricalelectronic materials the company has a long tradition of growth dating back to 1928 the year we were founded in atlanta georgia we have increased sales in 56 of the last 57 years and increased profits in 44 of the last 46 years in 2006 business was conducted throughout the united states in puerto rico in canada and in mexico from approximately 2000 locations 

we recorded consolidated net sales of 105 billion for the year ended december 31 2006 an increase of 7 compared to 98 billion in 2005 consolidated net income for the year ended december 31 2006 was 475 million up 9 from 437 million in 2005 the combination of ongoing healthy economic conditions strong end markets and effective internal initiatives provided us the opportunity to achieve another record level of sales and earnings in 2006 all four business segments contributed to our progress for the year with each showing gains in revenues and profits 

our progress in 2006 follows 8 increases in revenues in both 2004 and 2005 and represents the third consecutive year of doubledigit growth in earnings per share during the threeyear period ended december 31 2006 the company implemented a variety of growth initiatives including the introduction of new and expanded product lines geographic expansion sales to new markets enhanced customer marketing programs and cost savings initiatives each of our business segments participated in developing these initiatives as discussed further below 

the major categories on the december 31 2006 consolidated balance sheet were relatively consistent with the december 31 2005 balance sheet categories subject to certain exceptions explained below our cash balances decreased 53 million or 28 from december 31 2005 due primarily to cash used during the year for increased working capital requirements and investments in capital expenditures accounts receivable grew 41 million or 3 which is less than our increase in revenues and inventory was up less than 1 accounts payable decreased 63 million or 7 from the prior year due primarily to the termination of extended terms with certain suppliers during 2006 resulting in the decrease in days payables outstanding total debt outstanding at december 31 2006 was unchanged from december 31 2005 

results of operations 

our results of operations are summarized for the three years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 as follows 

 

net sales 

consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31 2006 totaled 105 billion another record sales level for the company and a 7 increase from 2005 again in 2006 each of our four business segments showed progress in revenues and contributed to our overall sales growth we attribute this improvement to the ongoing good health of the national economy strong end markets and effective growth initiatives for the year prices were up approximately 2 in the automotive segment 3 in the industrial and office segments and 7 in the electrical segment 

net sales for the year ended december 31 2005 totaled 98 billion an 8 increase from 2004 similar to 2006 all of the business segments contributed to our sales growth in 2005 as our internal initiatives healthy economy and positive trends in the industries we serve enhanced the sales volume in each of our four groups prices were up approximately 2 in the automotive segment 3 in the office and electrical segments and 6 in the industrial segment in 2005 

automotive group 

net sales for the automotive group “automotive” increased by 3 to 52 billion in 2006 after achieving sales increases of 5 in both the first and second quarters our sales growth slowed to 1 growth in the third quarter followed by a 2 increase in the fourth quarter automotives’ sales initiatives including the addition of 64 net new napa auto parts stores and the continued expansion of napa autocare programs were somewhat impacted by the effect of higher gasoline prices on vehicle miles driven and aftermarket product demand both of these factors influenced our sales trends for the year additionally our core napa sales increase of 5 was offset by the sales decrease at johnson industries which was downsized in 2005 

automotive sales were 50 billion in 2005 an increase of 6 over 2004 among the quarters in 2005 sales increases over the same period of the prior year ranged from an increase of 4 in the first quarter to 8 in the third quarter our strongest period for the year the continued effectiveness of our growth initiatives in this group as well as positive industry trends helped produce these results as in 2006 stronger growth in our core napa operations was offset by a decrease in sales at johnson industries where we sold eight of twelve operations during 2005 

industrial group 

net sales for motion industries our industrial group “industrial” were 31 billion in 2006 an increase of 11 compared to 2005 and our third consecutive year of 11 sales growth in 2006 this group recorded steady progress throughout the year with doubledigit growth in each quarter industrial expanded its distribution network during the year by opening 10 new locations and by adding another 31 locations via two acquisitions us industrial production and capacity utilization indices also showed continued strength for the manufacturing sector in 2006 and based on current indices the outlook remains positive for this sector in 2007 

net sales in 2005 were 28 billion an 11 increase compared to 2004 in 2005 this group had doubledigit growth in each quarter except in the fourth quarter when sales increased 9 over the threeyear period ended december 31 2006 industrial has benefited from a combination of price increases common in the industry as well as stronger sales volume 

office group 

net sales for sp richards our office products group “office” were 18 billion an increase of 7 compared to the prior year among our business groups office is our most steady performer from year to year and in 2006 product and customer expansion efforts and the continued development of effective marketing programs and dealer services helped to drive this group’s progress although its rate of sales growth decreased during the year we were encouraged by the office group’s performance in 2006 sales increased by 13 in the first quarter 6 in the second quarter 5 in the third quarter and 4 in the fourth quarter 

net sales in 2005 were 17 billion up 8 over 2004 this represents a solid increase for the office group and reflects the success of its ongoing business expansion strategy among the quarters revenues grew stronger over the year with sales increasing 6 in the first quarter 8 in the second and third quarters and 10 in the fourth quarter 

electrical group 

net sales for eis our electrical and electronic group “electrical” increased by 20 to 408 million in 2006 the strong performance at electrical reflects the continued manufacturing expansion in the us as well as this group’s commitment to ongoing sales initiatives in 2006 electrical completed phase one of a sales process restructuring program developed to improve customer contact and maximize customer growth for the year sales were up 13 in the first quarter 24 in the second quarter 23 in the third quarter and 17 in the fourth quarter 

net sales were up 2 to 342 million in 2005 electrical’s strongest performance was in the fourth quarter after generally flat results over the first three quarters of the year eis sold its circuit supply division in april of 2005 which impacted its overall growth rate the ongoing electrical operations were up 9 for the year reflecting the continued strength in the manufacturing sector which began to show improvement late in 2003 

cost of goods sold 

cost of goods sold was 72 billion and 67 billion in 2006 and 2005 respectively representing 687 of net sales in both years after improving gross margins in each of the previous two years our ongoing gross margin growth initiatives were offset in 2006 by increasing competitive pricing pressures in the markets we serve our initiatives to enhance our pricing strategies promote and sell higher margin products and minimize material acquisition costs lessened the effect of these negative margin pressures in 2006 

cost of goods sold in 2005 was 67 billion or 687 of net sales compared to 63 billion or 689 in 2004 the decrease in cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales reflects the success of our initiatives implemented to improve gross margins these initiatives were initially developed to offset the usual competitive pricing pressures as well as lower levels of vendor discounts and volume incentives earned over the prior few years especially in industrial each of our business segments also experienced vendor price increases in 2005 and by working with our customers we were able to pass some of these along to them particularly in industrial 

operating expenses 

selling administrative and other expenses “sga” increased to 24 billion in 2006 representing 228 of sales and down slightly from 229 of sales in 2005 sga expenses as a percentage of net sales reflect the benefits of our cost control initiatives our cost management initiatives continue to emphasize continuous improvement programs designed to optimize our utilization of people and systems we were pleased with the success of our initiatives and expect our sga expenses as a percentage of sales to show progress in the foreseeable future depreciation and amortization expense in 2006 was 73 million up 12 from 2005 which relates to the increase in capital expenditures in the current year the provision for doubtful accounts was 16 million in 2006 consistent with our bad debt expense in 2005 

in 2005 sga increased to 22 billion or 229 of net sales a slight increase from 228 of sales in 2004 depreciation and amortization expense in 2005 was 66 million up 5 from 2004 and corresponds to the increase in capital expenditures in 2005 relative to the prior year the provision for doubtful accounts was 16 million in 2005 down from 21 million in the prior year this was due to our improved collections on accounts receivable balances relative to 2004 when the company incurred unusually high bad debt losses 

nonoperating expenses 

nonoperating expenses for the company consist primarily of interest interest expense was 32 million 34 million and 39 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the decrease in interest expense in 2006 is primarily due to the termination of an interest rate swap agreement 

in 2005 the decrease in interest expense from the prior year relates to the repayment of borrowings during 2004 to its current level 

in “other” interest income net of minority interests increased in both 2006 and 2005 due to the change in interest income earned on the company’s cash balances 

operating profit 

operating profit was 846 million in 2006 an increase of 74 from 788 million in 2005 operating profit as a percentage of net sales which we refer to as operating margin was 81 in 2006 reflecting no change from our operating margin achieved in 2005 and 2004 our constant operating margin over the last three years is primarily the result of specific shortterm margin issues in automotive which offset the benefits of our overall improvement in gross margin and sga expense as a percentage of net sales over these periods we discuss these issues further below we remain optimistic that our margins will show improvement in the year ahead 

automotive group 

automotive operating margins decreased to 77 in 2006 from 79 in 2005 during 2006 the company recorded nonrecurring costs associated with certain closing and consolidation expenses at johnson industries and our remanufacturing operations at johnson industries we sold or closed eight of twelve locations during 2005 resulting in selling and closure costs in that year and we incurred additional costs to downsize these operations in 2006 at our remanufacturing operations we incurred costs during the year related to certain facility consolidations 

automotive operating margins decreased to 79 in 2005 from 84 in 2004 despite showing progress in our core napa operations automotive was challenged with specific issues at johnson industries as discussed above and within the remanufacturing operations we made some price adjustments to certain product lines to drive sales growth resulting in lower margins for this group relative to the prior year we consider the issues reviewed for 2005 and 2006 to be shortterm challenges for this group and believe our automotive operating margins will show improvement in the year ahead 

industrial group 

industrial operating margins increased to 83 in 2006 from 77 in 2005 this represents the third consecutive year of margin improvement for industrial and reflects the effectiveness of our sales and operating initiatives as well as the relative strength of the industries served by industrial over these periods industrial operating margins increased to 77 in 2005 from 69 in 2004 this was the largest margin gain among our business segments in 2005 and reflects the strong performance at industrial for the year 

office group 

operating margins in office were 94 in 2006 down slightly from 95 in 2005 office continues to generate industry leading operating margins despite competitive pricing pressures in the industry these pressures are offset by ongoing product and customer expansion efforts and the continued development of effective marketing programs and dealer services office operating margins were 95 in 2005 down from 98 in 2004 the success of this group’s sales initiatives was offset by pricing pressures which resulted in the decrease in operating margin in 2005 

electrical group 

operating margins in electrical increased to 55 in 2006 from 51 in 2005 this represents the third consecutive year of margin improvement for electrical and reflects the continued strength in the manufacturing sector of the economy combined with electrical’s successful growth strategy during this three year period operating margins in electrical increased to 51 in 2005 from 44 in 2004 we are encouraged by the ongoing progress we see in electrical 

income taxes 

the effective income tax rate was 383 in 2006 unchanged from the effective rate in 2005 the effective income tax rate increased to 383 in 2005 from 378 in 2004 the increase in 2005 was primarily due to higher state income taxes in that year and favorable nonrecurring items in the prior year 

net income 

net income was 475 million in 2006 an increase of 9 from 437 million in 2005 on a per share diluted basis net income was 276 in 2006 compared to 250 in 2005 up 10 2006 represents our third consecutive year of doubledigit growth in diluted earnings per share net income in 2006 and 2005 was 45 of net sales 

net income was 437 million in 2005 up 11 from 396 million in 2004 and on a per share diluted basis net income was 250 in 2005 compared to 225 in 2004 net income in 2005 was 45 of net sales compared to 43 in 2004 

sharebased compensation 

effective january 1 2006 the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123r choosing the “modified prospective” method compensation cost recognized for the year ended december 31 2006 includes a compensation cost for all sharebased payments granted prior to but not yet vested as of january 1 2006 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 123 and b compensation cost for all sharebased payments granted subsequent to january 1 2006 based on the grant date fair value estimated with the provisions of sfas no 123r results for prior periods have not been restated most options may be exercised not earlier than twelve months nor later than ten years from the date of grant as of january 1 2006 there was approximately 12 million of unrecognized compensation cost for all awards granted prior to january 1 2003 to employees that remained unvested prior to the effective date of sfas no 123r this compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weightedaverage period of approximately four years for the year ended december 31 2006 total compensation cost related to nonvested awards not yet recognized was approximately 202 million the weightedaverage period over which this compensation cost is expected to be recognized is approximately three years for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 119 million 69 million and 25 million of sharebased compensation cost was recorded respectively there have been no modifications to valuation methodologies or methods subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 123r 

financial condition 

the major consolidated balance sheet categories at december 31 2006 with the exception of the accounts discussed below were relatively consistent with the december 31 2005 balance sheet categories the company’s cash balances decreased 53 million or 28 from december 31 2005 due primarily to cash used during the year for increased working capital requirements and investments in capital expenditures our accounts receivable balance at december 31 2006 increased 3 compared to the prior year which is less than our increase in revenues for the fourth quarter and year inventory at december 31 2006 was up less than 1 from december 31 2005 reflecting our continued emphasis on inventory management prepaid expenses and other current assets increased 20 million or 10 from december 31 2005 reflecting the increase in receivables due from vendors accounts payable at december 31 2006 decreased 63 million or 7 from the prior year due primarily to the termination of extended terms with certain suppliers during 2006 and the resulting decrease in days payables outstanding 

other assets at december 31 2006 decreased 339 million or 67 other longterm liabilities increased 73 million or 64 and accumulated other comprehensive loss income included as a component of shareholders’ equity was a loss of 243 million at december 31 2006 compared to income of 46 million at december 31 2005 these changes in other assets other longterm liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive loss were primarily due to the pension adjustments required by sfas no 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 

liquidity and capital resources 

the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 32 to 1 at december 31 2006 compared to 30 to 1 at december 31 2005 our cash position remains strong the company had 500 million in total debt outstanding at december 31 2006 and 2005 

a summary of the company’s consolidated statements of cash flows is as follows 

 

net cash provided by operating activities 

the company continues to generate excellent cash flows with 434 million in net cash provided by operating activities in 2006 the 9 increase in net income was offset by the use of cash for working capital requirements during the year resulting in a slight decrease in cash from operations compared to 2005 in 2005 the company generated 441 million in cash from operations a decrease from 2004 despite an increase in net income in 2005 the 2005 operating cash flows were down from the prior year primarily due to an increase of 70 million in contributions to companysponsored defined benefit plans in addition the company’s extended term negotiations and other working capital improvements in 2004 were especially favorable for operating cash flows in that year the company believes existing credit facilities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund its operations and to meet its cash requirements 

net cash used in investing activities 

cash flow used in investing activities was 146 million in 2006 up from the prior two years due primarily to increased spending for capital expenditures during the year in 2006 capital expenditures were 126 million compared to approximately 86 million and 72 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively the company believes that 2006 was an extraordinary year for capital spending due in part to the timing of certain assets placed in service during the year the company expects its investment in capital expenditures to decrease to more customary levels in the foreseeable future 

net cash used in financing activities 

the company used 341 million of cash in financing activities in 2006 primarily for dividends to shareholders and the repurchase of the company’s common stock dividends and share repurchases were also the primary financing activities in 2005 and in 2004 the primary financing activities were the dividend and repayment of borrowings the company paid dividends to shareholders of 228 million 216 million and 209 million during 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the company expects this trend of increasing dividends to continue in the foreseeable future during 2006 2005 and 2004 the company repurchased 123 million 119 million and 21 million respectively in company stock we plan to remain active in our share repurchase program but the amount and value of shares repurchased will vary annually 

while no borrowings were repaid in 2006 or 2005 the company repaid variable rate borrowings of approximately 177 million in 2004 longterm debt of 500 million at december 31 2006 is comprised of two 250 million term notes with a consortium of financial and insurance institutions due in 2008 and 2011 the company does not anticipate repaying these notes prior to their scheduled expiration the increasing dividends and fluctuations in cash used for share repurchases and the reduction of debt primarily explain the changes in cash used for financing activities in 2006 2005 and 2004 

notes and other borrowings 

the company maintains a 350 million unsecured revolving line of credit with a consortium of financial institutions which matures in october 2008 and bears interest at libor plus 25 557 at december 31 2006 at december 31 2006 and 2005 no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit 

at december 31 2006 the company had unsecured senior notes outstanding under a 500 million financing arrangement as follows 250 million series a 586 fixed due 2008 and 250 million series b 623 fixed due 2011 certain borrowings contain covenants related to a maximum debttoequity ratio a minimum fixedcharge coverage ratio and certain limitations on additional borrowings at december 31 2006 the company was in compliance with all such covenants the weighted average interest rate on the company’s outstanding borrowings was approximately 605 at december 31 2006 and 2005 total interest expense net of interest income for all borrowings was 264 million 296 million and 373 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

construction and lease agreement 

the company also has an 85 million construction and lease agreement with an unaffiliated third party properties acquired by the lessor are constructed and then leased to the company under operating lease agreements the total amount advanced and outstanding under this agreement at december 31 2006 was approximately 84 million since the resulting leases are operating leases no debt obligation is recorded on the company’s balance sheet this construction and lease agreement expires in 2009 and no additional properties are being added to this agreement as the construction term has ended lease payments fluctuate based upon current interest rates and are generally based upon libor plus 50 the lease agreement contains residual value guarantee provisions and guarantees under events of default although management believes the likelihood of funding to be remote the maximum guarantee obligation which represents our residual value guarantee under the construction and lease agreement is approximately 73 million at december 31 2006 refer to note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this arrangement 

contractual and other obligations 

the following table shows the company’s approximate obligations and commitments excluding interest due on credit facilities to make future payments under contractual obligations as of december 31 2006 

 

purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in our estimates we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements our purchase orders are based on our current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons the company does not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements 

as discussed in “construction and lease agreement” above the company has approximately 84 million outstanding under a construction and lease agreement which expires in 2009 in addition the company guarantees the borrowings of certain independently controlled automotive parts stores independents and certain other affiliates in which the company has a minority equity ownership interest affiliates the company’s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these independents and affiliates is equal to the total borrowings subject to the company’s guarantee to date the company has had no significant losses in connection with guarantees of independents’ and affiliates’ borrowings the following table shows the company’s approximate commercial commitments under these two arrangements as of december 31 2006 

 

in addition the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans that may obligate us to make contributions to the plans from time to time contributions in 2006 were 67 million we expect to make a cash contribution to our qualified defined benefit plans in 2007 and contributions required for 2008 and future years will depend on a number of unpredictable factors including the market performance of the plans’ assets and future changes in interest rates that affect the actuarial measurement of the plans’ obligations 

share repurchases 

on april 19 1999 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of 15 million shares of our common stock and on august 21 2006 the board authorized the repurchase of an additional 15 million shares such repurchase plans were announced on april 20 1999 and august 21 2006 respectively the authorization for these repurchase plans continues until all such shares have been repurchased or the repurchase plan is terminated by action of the board of directors through december 31 2006 approximately 147 million shares have been repurchased under these authorizations 

critical accounting estimates 

general 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities net sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially impact the consolidated financial statements management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for further information on the critical accounting policies see note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

inventories – provisions for slow moving and obsolescence 

the company identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates appropriate loss provisions related thereto historically these loss provisions have not been significant as the vast majority of the company’s inventories are not highly susceptible to obsolescence and are eligible for return under various vendor return programs while the company has no reason to believe its inventory return privileges will be discontinued in the future its risk of loss associated with obsolete or slow moving inventories would increase if such were to occur 

allowance for doubtful accounts – methodology 

the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors initially the company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on historical bad debt experience this initial estimate is periodically adjusted when the company becomes aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations eg bankruptcy filing or as a result of changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable while the company has a large customer base that is geographically dispersed a general economic downturn in any of the industry segments in which the company operates could result in higher than expected defaults and therefore the need to revise estimates for bad debts for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 the company recorded provisions for bad debts of 165 million 164 million and 207 million respectively 

consideration received from vendors 

the company enters into agreements at the beginning of each year with many of its vendors providing for inventory purchase incentives and advertising allowances generally the company earns inventory purchase incentives upon achieving specified volume purchasing levels and advertising allowances upon fulfilling its obligations related to cooperative advertising programs the company accrues for the receipt of inventory purchase incentives as part of its inventory cost based on cumulative purchases of inventory to date and projected inventory purchases through the end of the year and in the case of advertising allowances upon completion of the company’s obligations related thereto while management believes the company will continue to receive such amounts in 2007 and beyond there can be no assurance that vendors will continue to provide comparable amounts of incentives and allowances in the future 

impairment of property plant and equipment and goodwill and other intangible assets 

at least annually the company evaluates property plant and equipment goodwill and other intangible assets for potential impairment indicators the company’s judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance among other factors future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired evaluating the impairment also requires the company to estimate future operating results and cash flows which require judgment by management any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

employee benefit plans 

the company’s benefit plan committees in the us and canada establish investment policies and strategies and regularly monitor the performance of the company’s pension plan assets the pension plan investment strategy implemented by the company’s management is to achieve longterm objectives and invest the pension assets in accordance with the applicable pension legislation in the us and canada and fiduciary standards the longterm primary objectives for the pension plan funds are to provide for a reasonable amount of longterm growth of capital without undue exposure to risk protect the assets from erosion of purchasing power and provide investment results that meet or exceed the pension plan’s actuarially assumed long term rate of return 

based on the investment policy for the us pension plan as well as an asset study that was performed based on the company’s set allocations and future expectations the company’s expected rate of return on plan assets for measuring 2007 pension expense or income is 825 for the us plan the asset study forecasted expected rates of return for the approximate duration of the company’s benefit obligations using capital market data and historical relationships 

the discount rate is chosen as the rate at which pension obligations could be effectively settled and is based on capital market conditions as of the measurement date we have matched the timing and duration of the expected cash flows of our pension obligations to a yield curve generated from a broad portfolio of highquality fixed income debt instruments to select our discount rate based upon this cash flow matching analysis we selected a discount rate for the us plan of 600 at december 31 2006 

net periodic cost for our defined benefit pension plans was 482 million 324 million and 264 million for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the increasing trend in pension cost over these periods was primarily due to the change in assumptions for the rate of return on plan assets the discount rate and the rate of compensation increases these expenses are included in sga expenses refer to note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding employee benefit plans 

on september 29 2006 the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  sfas no 158 was effective for public companies for fiscal years ending after december 15 2006 the company adopted the balance sheet recognition provisions of sfas no 158 at the end of fiscal 2006 refer to note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for details regarding the incremental effect of adopting sfas no 158 

the company has evaluated the potential impact of the pension protection act “the act” which was passed into law on august 17 2006 on future us pension plan funding requirements based on current market conditions the act is not anticipated to have a material effect on the level of future funding requirements or on the company’s liquidity and capital resources

risks relating to our company 

we depend on our relationships with our vendors 

as a distributor of automotive replacement parts industrial parts office products and electricalelectronic materials our business is dependent on developing and maintaining close and productive relationships with our vendors we depend on our vendors to sell us quality products at favorable prices many factors outside our control may harm these relationships for example financial or operational difficulties with a vendor could cause that vendor to increase the cost of the products we purchase from it vendor consolidation could also limit the number of suppliers from which we may purchase products and could materially affect the prices we pay for these products also consolidation among automotive parts or industrial parts and office product suppliers could disrupt our relationship with some vendors a disruption of our vendor relationships or a disruption in our vendors’ operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

our business and results of operations could be impacted by certain laws 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the operation of our business such as laws and regulations relating to environmental and employment matters because such laws and regulations are subject to change without notice we cannot anticipate the potential costs of compliance on the other hand if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions there can be no assurance that the cost of compliance or a material failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us in the future 

risks relating to our industry 

we face substantial competition in the industries in which we do business 

the industries in which we do business are highly competitive the sale of automotive and industrial parts office products and electronic materials is highly competitive in many areas including name recognition product availability customer service anticipating changing customer preferences store location and price increased competition among distributors of automotive and industrial parts office products and electronic materials could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

in particular the market for replacement automotive parts is highly competitive and subjects us to a wide variety of competitors we compete primarily with national and regional auto parts chains independently owned automotive parts and accessories stores automobile dealers that supply manufacturer replacement parts and accessories mass merchandisers and wholesale clubs that sell automotive products and regional and local full service automotive repair shops if we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies or if our competitors develop more effective strategies we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

our business may be materially affected if demand for our products slows 

our business depends on customer demand for the products that we distribute demand for these products depends on many factors with respect to our automotive group the primary factors are the number of miles vehicles are driven annually as higher vehicle mileage increases the need for maintenance and repair the quality of the vehicles manufactured by the original vehicle manufacturers and the length of the warranty or maintenance offered on new vehicles the number of vehicles in current service that are six years old and older as these vehicles are typically no longer under the original vehicle manufacturers’ warranty and will need more maintenance and repair than newer vehicles restrictions on access to diagnostic tools and repair information imposed by the original vehicle manufacturers or by governmental regulation and the economy generally 

our business may be impacted by general economic conditions and local national and global events 

our business and results of operations also may be impacted by general economic conditions conditions in local markets or other factors that we cannot control including job growth and unemployment conditions industrial output and capacity and capital expenditures reduction in manufacturing capacity in our targeted geographic markets due to consolidation and the transfer of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries weather terrorist acts pricing pressures of our competitors and customers shortages of fuel or interruptions in transportation systems labor strikes work stoppages or other interruptions to or difficulties in the employment of labor in the major markets where we operate changes in interest rates inflation or currency exchange rates changes in accounting policies and practices and changes in regulatory policies and practices
