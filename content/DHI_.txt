operating structure and processes 

following is an overview of our company’s operating structure and the significant processes that support our business controls strategies and performance 

homebuilding markets 

our homebuilding business operates in 106 markets across 33 states which provides us with geographic diversification in our homebuilding inventory investments and our sources of revenues and earnings we believe our geographic diversification lowers our operational risks by mitigating the effects of local and regional economic cycles and it also enhances our earnings potential by providing more diverse opportunities to invest in our business 

we conduct our homebuilding operations in the geographic regions states and markets listed below our homebuilding operating divisions are aggregated into six reporting segments also referred to as reporting regions which comprise the markets below our financial statements and the notes thereto contain additional information regarding segment performance 



when evaluating new or existing homebuilding markets for purposes of capital allocation we consider local marketspecific factors including among others 

• economic conditions 

• employment levels and job growth 

• income level of potential homebuyers 

• local housing affordability and typical mortgage products utilized 

• market for homes at our targeted price points 

• availability of land and lots in desirable locations on acceptable terms 

• land entitlement and development processes 

• availability of qualified subcontractors 

• new and secondary home sales activity 

• competition 

• prevailing housing products features cost and pricing and 

• performance capabilities of our local management team 

economies of scale 

we are the largest homebuilding company in the united states in fiscal 2022 as measured by number of homes closed and we are also one of the largest builders in most of the markets in which we operate we believe that our national regional and local scale of operations provides us with benefits that may not be available to the same degree to some other smaller homebuilders such as 

• greater access to and lower cost of capital due to our balance sheet strength and our lending and capital markets relationships 

• volume discounts and rebates from national regional and local materials suppliers and lower labor rates from certain subcontractors and 

• enhanced leverage of our general and administrative activities which allows us flexibility to adjust to changes in market conditions and compete effectively across our markets 

decentralized homebuilding operations 

we view homebuilding as a local business therefore most of our direct homebuilding activities are decentralized to provide flexibility to our local managers in making operational decisions we believe that our local management teams who are familiar with local market conditions have the best information to make many decisions regarding their operations at september 30 2022 we had 78 separate homebuilding operating divisions many of which operate in more than one market area generally each operating division consists of a division president a controller and accounting personnel land entitlement acquisition and development personnel a sales manager and sales and marketing personnel a construction manager and construction superintendents customer service personnel a purchasing manager and office staff our division presidents receive performancebased compensation if they achieve targeted financial and operating metrics related to their operating divisions following is a summary of our homebuilding activities that are decentralized in our local operating divisions and the control and oversight functions that are centralized in our regional and corporate offices 

operating division responsibilities 

each homebuilding operating division is responsible for 

• site selection which involves 

— a feasibility study 

— soil and environmental reviews 

— review of existing zoning and other governmental requirements

centralized controls 

we centralize many important risk elements of our homebuilding business through our regional and corporate offices we have separate homebuilding regional offices which generally consist of a region president a chief financial officer legal counsel and other operational and office support staff each of our region presidents and their management teams are responsible for oversight of the operations of a number of homebuilding operating divisions including

• review of all business and financial analysis for potential land and lot inventory investments 

• oversight of land and home inventory levels

landlot acquisition and inventory management 

we acquire land for use in our homebuilding and rental operations after we have completed due diligence and generally after we have obtained the rights known as entitlements to begin development or construction work resulting in an acceptable number of residential lots before we acquire lots or tracts of land we complete a feasibility study which includes soil tests independent environmental studies other engineering work and financial analysis we also evaluate the status of necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements required to develop and use the property for home construction although we purchase and develop land primarily to support our homebuilding activities we may sell land and lots to other developers and homebuilders where we have excess land and lot positions or for other strategic reasons 

we also enter into landlot contracts in which we obtain the right but generally not the obligation to buy land or lots at predetermined prices on a defined schedule commensurate with anticipated home closings or planned development these contracts generally are nonrecourse which limits our financial exposure to our earnest money deposited into escrow under the terms of the contract and any preacquisition due diligence costs we incur this enables us to control land and lot positions with limited capital investment which substantially reduces the risks associated with land ownership 

we directly acquire almost all of our land and lot positions we are a party to a small number of joint ventures joint ventures are consolidated if we have a controlling interest or accounted for under the equity method of accounting if we have a significant influence but not control 

we attempt to mitigate our exposure to real estate inventory risks by 

• controlling our level of inventory investment and managing our supply of landlots owned and controlled through purchase contracts to match the expected housing demand in each of our operating markets 

• monitoring local market and demographic trends housing preferences and related economic developments including the identification of desirable housing submarkets based on the quality of local schools new job opportunities local growth initiatives and personal income trends 

• utilizing landlot purchase contracts and seeking to acquire developed lots which are substantially ready for home construction where possible and 

• monitoring and managing the number of speculative homes homes under construction without an executed sales contract built in each subdivision 

land development and home construction 

substantially all of our land development and home construction work is performed by subcontractors subcontractors typically are selected after a competitive bidding process and are retained for a specific subdivision or series of house plans pursuant to a contract that obligates the subcontractor to complete the scope of work at an agreedupon price we employ land development managers and construction superintendents to monitor land development and home construction activities participate in major building decisions coordinate the activities of subcontractors and suppliers review the work of subcontractors for quality and cost controls and monitor compliance with zoning and building codes in addition our construction superintendents interact with our homebuyers during the construction process and instruct buyers on postclosing home maintenance 

our home designs are selected or prepared in each of our markets to appeal to local homebuyers’ expectations for affordability home size and features and our local management teams adjust product offerings to meet buyer demand as necessary in many communities we offer optional interior and exterior features to homebuyers for an additional charge construction time for our homes depends on the availability of labor materials and supplies the weather the size of the home and other factors we completed the construction of most homes in four to nine months during fiscal 2022 which is longer than prior years as construction times have been impacted by the labor and materials shortages discussed below 

we typically do not maintain significant inventories of land development or construction materials except for work in progress materials for active development projects and homes under construction generally the construction materials used in our operations have been readily available from numerous sources and we have contracts exceeding one year with certain suppliers of building materials that are cancelable at our option in fiscal 2021 our construction cycle time lengthened primarily due to the covid19 pandemic and its effects on our supply chain which resulted in shortages of certain building materials and tightness in the construction labor market continuing supply chain delays and disruptions during fiscal 2022 lengthened our construction cycle time further 

we are subject to governmental regulations that affect our land development and construction operations in fiscal 2021 and 2022 we frequently experienced delays in receiving the proper approvals from municipalities or other government agencies which delayed our anticipated development and construction activities in certain communities 

cost controls 

we control construction costs by designing our homes efficiently and by obtaining competitive bids for construction materials and labor we also competitively bid and negotiate pricing from our subcontractors and suppliers based on the volume of services and products we purchase on a local regional and national basis we monitor our land development expenditures and construction costs versus budgets for each house and community and we review our inventory levels margins expenses profitability and returns for each operating market compared to both its business plan and our performance expectations 

we control overhead costs by centralizing certain accounting and administrative functions monitoring staffing and compensation levels and by applying technology to business processes to improve productivity where practical we review other general and administrative costs to identify efficiencies and savings opportunities in our operating divisions and our regional and corporate offices we also direct many of our promotional activities toward local real estate brokers and digital marketing initiatives which we believe are efficient uses of our marketing expenditures 

marketing and sales 

we primarily use the dr horton emerald homes express homes and freedom homes brand names to market and sell our homes our dr horton branded communities are the core of our business and account for the majority of our home closings focusing primarily on the first time and first time moveup homebuyer our emerald branded communities appeal to buyers in search of higherend moveup and luxury homes our express branded communities primarily accommodate entrylevel buyers who are focused on affordability our freedom homes brand offers homes at affordable price points to active adult buyers seeking a lowmaintenance lifestyle 

we market and sell our homes primarily through commissioned employees and the majority of our home closings also involve an independent real estate broker we typically conduct home sales from sales offices located in furnished model homes in each subdivision and we generally do not offer our model homes for sale until the completion of a subdivision our sales personnel assist prospective homebuyers by providing floor plans and price information demonstrating the features and layouts of our homes and assisting with the selection of options when available we train and inform our sales personnel regarding construction schedules and marketing and advertising plans as market conditions warrant we may provide potential homebuyers with incentives such as discounts or included upgrades to be competitive in a particular market or to attain our targeted sales pace 

we market our homes and communities to prospective homebuyers and real estate brokers digitally through email search engine marketing social media and our company website and other real estate websites in addition to print media and advertisement we also use billboards radio television and print advertising locally as necessary we attempt to position our subdivisions in locations that are desirable to potential homebuyers and convenient to or visible from local traffic patterns which helps to reduce advertising costs model homes play an important role in our marketing efforts and we expend significant effort and resources to create an attractive atmosphere in our model homes 

we also build speculative homes in most of our communities which allow us to compete effectively with existing homes available in the market and improve our returns these homes enhance our marketing and sales efforts to prospective homebuyers who are renters or who are relocating to these markets and require a home within a short time frame as well as to independent brokers who represent these homebuyers we determine our speculative homes strategy in each market based on local market factors such as new job growth and relocations housing demand and supply seasonality current sales contract cancellation trends and our past experience in the market we attempt to maintain a level of speculative home inventory in each community based on our current and planned sales pace and we monitor and adjust speculative home inventory on an ongoing basis 

sales contracts and backlog 

our sales contracts require an earnest money deposit which varies in amount across our markets and communities additionally customers are generally required to pay additional deposits when they select options or upgrade features for their homes our sales contracts include a financing contingency which permits customers to cancel and receive a refund of their deposit if they cannot obtain mortgage financing at prevailing or specified interest rates within a defined period our contracts may include other contingencies such as the sale of an existing home we either retain or refund customer deposits on cancelled sales contracts depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances 

sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period at september 30 2022 the value of our backlog of sales orders was 80 billion 19614 homes a decrease of 16 from 95 billion 26221 homes at september 30 2021 the average sales price of homes in backlog was 406600 at september 30 2022 up from the 360900 average at september 30 2021 many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies such as those described above which can result in cancellations as a percentage of gross sales orders cancellations of sales contracts were 21 in fiscal 2022 compared to 17 in fiscal 2021 

the length of time between the signing of a sales contract for a home and delivery of the home to the buyer closing is generally from two to seven months therefore substantially all of the homes in our sales backlog at september 30 2022 are scheduled to close in fiscal 2023 

customer service and quality control 

our homebuilding operating divisions are responsible for preclosing quality control inspections and responding to customers’ postclosing needs we believe that a prompt and courteous response to homebuyers’ needs during and after construction reduces postclosing repair costs enhances our reputation for quality and service and ultimately leads to repeat and referral business from the real estate community and homebuyers we typically provide our homebuyers with a tenyear limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems a twoyear limited warranty on major mechanical systems and a oneyear limited warranty on other construction components the subcontractors who perform the actual construction also provide us with warranties on workmanship and are expected to respond to us and the homeowner in a timely manner in addition some of our suppliers provide manufacturer’s warranties on specified products installed in the home 

rental properties 

our multifamily rental operations develop construct lease and sell residential properties that produce rental income we primarily focus on constructing garden style multifamily rental communities typically accommodating 200 to 400 dwelling units in high growth suburban markets we sold 775 multifamily rental units in fiscal 2022 compared to 959 units in fiscal 2021 our singlefamily rental operations construct and lease singlefamily homes within a community and then market each community for a bulk sale of rental homes we sold 774 singlefamily rental homes in fiscal 2022 compared to 257 homes in fiscal 2021 

forestar residential lot development operations 

during fiscal 2018 we acquired 75 of the outstanding shares of forestar forestar is a residential lot development company with operations in 53 markets across 21 states as of september 30 2022 we owned approximately 63 of forestar’s outstanding common stock at september 30 2022 forestar is a component of our homebuilding strategy to enhance operational efficiency and returns by expanding relationships with land developers and increasing the portion of our land and lot position controlled through land purchase contracts forestar is investing in land acquisition and development to expand its residential lot development business across a geographically diversified national platform and consolidate market share in the fragmented us lot development industry our homebuilding operations acquire finished lots from forestar in accordance with the master supply agreement between the two companies a shared services agreement is in place whereby we provide forestar certain administrative compliance operational and procurement services as the controlling shareholder we have significant influence in guiding the strategic direction and operations of forestar 

customer mortgage financing 

we provide mortgage financing services principally to purchasers of our homes in the majority of our homebuilding markets through dhi mortgage our whollyowned subsidiary dhi mortgage assists in the sales transaction by coordinating the mortgage application mortgage commitment and home closing processes to facilitate a timely and efficient experience for our homebuyers during the year ended september 30 2022 dhi mortgage provided mortgage financing services for approximately 69 of our total homes closed and approximately 98 of dhi mortgage’s loan volume related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations most of our homebuilding divisions also work with additional mortgage lenders that offer a range of mortgage financing programs to our homebuyers 

to limit the risks associated with our mortgage operations dhi mortgage originates loan products that we believe can be sold to thirdparty purchasers of mortgage loans the majority of which are eligible for sale to the federal national mortgage association fannie mae the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac or the government national mortgage association ginnie mae dhi mortgage sells substantially all of the loans and the related servicing rights to thirdparty purchasers after origination with limited recourse provisions dhi mortgage centralizes most of its control and oversight functions including those related to loan underwriting quality control regulatory compliance secondary marketing of loans hedging activities accounting and financial reporting

we plan to publish our inaugural esg report during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 

business acquisitions 

we routinely evaluate opportunities to profitably expand our operations including potential acquisitions of other homebuilding or related businesses acquisitions of homebuilding and related businesses usually provide us with immediate land and home inventories and control of additional land and lot positions through purchase contracts also employees of acquired businesses generally have specialized knowledge of local market conditions including existing relationships with municipalities land owners developers subcontractors and suppliers these inventory positions and local market knowledge and relationships could take us several years to develop through our own efforts we seek to limit the risks associated with acquiring other companies by conducting extensive operational financial and legal due diligence on each acquisition and by performing financial analysis to determine that each acquisition is expected to have a positive impact on our earnings within an acceptable period of time 

competition 

the homebuilding lot development and rental housing industries are highly competitive we compete not only for homebuyers and renters but also for desirable properties raw materials skilled labor and financing we compete with local regional and national companies in these industries and also with existing home sales foreclosures and rental properties we compete on the basis of price location quality and design of our homes and on mortgage financing terms 

the competitors to our financial services businesses include other mortgage lenders and title companies including national regional and local mortgage banks and other financial institutions some of these competitors are subject to fewer governmental regulations and have greater access to capital than we do may operate with different lending criteria andor may offer a broader or more attractive array of financing and other products and services to potential customers we strive to provide flexible fairly priced financing alternatives subject to applicable regulations 

our businesses compete with other companies across all industries to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced employees managers and executives competition for the services of these individuals increases as business conditions improve in the homebuilding lot development financial services and rental housing industries and in the general economy 

governmental regulations and environmental matters 

the homebuilding lot development and rental housing industries are subject to extensive and complex regulations we and the subcontractors we use must comply with many federal state and local laws and regulations these include zoning density and development requirements and building environmental advertising labor and real estate sales rules and regulations these regulations and requirements affect substantially all aspects of our land development and home design construction and sales processes in varying degrees across our markets our homes are inspected by local authorities where required and homes eligible for insurance or guarantees provided by the federal housing administration fha and the us department of veteran affairs va are subject to inspection by them these regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities in addition our new housing developments may be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets utilities and other public improvements 

our construction and land development activities are also subject to an extensive array of local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning protection of health safety and the environment the particular compliance requirements for each site vary greatly according to location environmental condition and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with existing environmental regulations applicable to our business additionally our compliance with such regulations has not had nor is expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows however changes in regulations could increase our costs to comply with such regulations as discussed in “item 1a risk factors” 

our mortgage company must comply with extensive state and federal laws and regulations which are administered by numerous agencies including the consumer financial protection bureau federal housing finance agency us department of housing and urban development fha va united states department of agriculture usda fannie mae freddie mac and ginnie mae these laws and regulations include many compliance requirements including licensing consumer disclosures fair lending and real estate settlement procedures as a result our operations are subject to regular extensive examinations by the applicable agencies 

seasonality 

although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again in the future we generally close more homes and generate greater revenues and pretax income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year the seasonal nature of our business can also cause significant variations in the working capital requirements for our homebuilding lot development financial services and rental operations as a result of seasonal activity our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year 




 item 1a risk factors 

discussion of our business and operations included in this annual report on form 10k should be read together with the risk factors set forth below they describe various risks and uncertainties we are or may become subject to many of which are difficult to predict or beyond our control although the risks are organized and described separately many of the risks are interrelated these risks and uncertainties together with other factors described elsewhere in this report have the potential to affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner 

risks related to our business and our industry 

the homebuilding lot development and rental housing industries are cyclical and affected by changes in economic real estate or other conditions that could adversely affect our business or financial results 

the homebuilding lot development and rental housing industries are cyclical and are significantly affected by changes in general and local economic and real estate conditions such as 

• employment levels 

• consumer confidence and spending 

• housing demand 

• availability of financing for homebuyers 

• availability of financing for companies that purchase our rental properties 

• interest rates 

• inflation 

• availability and prices of new homes and existing homes for sale and availability and market values of rental properties and 

• demographic trends 

adverse changes in these general and local economic conditions or deterioration in the broader economy may negatively impact our business and financial results and increase the risk for asset impairments and writeoffs changes in these economic conditions may affect some of our regions or markets more than others if adverse conditions affect our larger markets they could have a proportionately greater impact on us than on some other companies 

the federal government’s fiscal policies and the federal reserve’s monetary policies may negatively impact the financial markets and consumer confidence and could hurt the us economy and the housing and rental markets and in turn could adversely affect the operating results of our businesses during fiscal 2022 in response to increased inflation the federal reserve raised interest rates significantly and has signaled it expects additional future interest rate increases as a result mortgage interest rates increased significantly and we began to see a moderation in housing demand increases in mortgage interest rates reduce the affordability of our homes and can have an adverse impact on our business or financial results 

deployments of us military personnel to foreign regions terrorist attacks other acts of violence or threats to national security and any corresponding response by the united states or others domestic or international instability or social or political unrest may cause an economic slowdown in the markets where we operate which could adversely affect our business 

if we experience any of the foregoing potential customers may be less willing or able to buy our homes or our rental properties additionally cancellations of home sales contracts in backlog may increase if homebuyers do not honor their contracts due to any of the factors discussed above our pricing and product strategies may also be limited by market conditions we may be unable to change the mix of our home or rental offerings reduce the costs of the homes or properties we build offer more affordable homes or rental properties or satisfactorily address changing market conditions in other ways without adversely affecting our profits and returns 

our financial services business is closely related to our homebuilding business as it originates mortgage loans principally to purchasers of the homes we build a decrease in the demand for our homes because of the foregoing matters will also adversely affect the financial results of this segment of our business an increase in the default rate on the mortgages we originate may adversely affect our ability to sell the mortgages or the pricing we receive upon the sale of mortgages or may increase our recourse obligations for previous originations we may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to thirdparty purchasers in the event of errors or omissions relating to certain representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the type of collateral the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in the connection with the loan and we may be required to repurchase certain of those mortgage loans or provide indemnification repurchased mortgage loans andor the settlement of claims associated with such loans could adversely affect our business or financial results we establish reserves for estimated losses and future repurchase obligations for mortgage loans we have sold however actual future obligations related to these mortgages could differ significantly from our current estimated amounts additionally we may retain mortgage servicing rights on our originations as servicer for these loans we may incur losses by having to advance payments to the mortgagebacked securities mbs bondholders to the extent there are insufficient collections to satisfy the required principal and interest remittances of the underlying mbs 

constriction of the credit and public capital markets could limit our ability to access capital and increase our costs of capital 

during past economic and housing downturns the credit markets constricted and reduced some sources of liquidity that were previously available to us consequently we relied principally on our cash on hand to meet our working capital needs and repay outstanding indebtedness during those times there likely will be periods in the future when financial market upheaval will increase our cost of capital or limit our ability to access the public debt markets or obtain bank financing 

our homebuilding operations utilize a 219 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to 30 billion subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments our homebuilding revolving credit facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit equal to 100 of the total revolving credit commitments the maturity date of the facility is october 28 2027 our homebuilding revolving credit facility and our homebuilding senior notes are guaranteed by dr horton inc’s significant whollyowned homebuilding subsidiaries 

forestar has a 410 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to 600 million subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments the forestar revolving credit facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit equal to the greater of 100 million and 50 of the total revolving credit commitments the maturity date of the facility is october 28 2026 the forestar revolving credit facility is guaranteed by forestar’s whollyowned subsidiaries that are not immaterial subsidiaries or have not been designated as unrestricted subsidiaries the forestar revolving credit facility is not guaranteed by dr horton inc or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee the debt of our homebuilding financial services or rental operations 

drh rental has a 1025 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to 125 billion subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments availability under the rental revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base calculation based on the book value of drh rental’s real estate assets and unrestricted cash at september 30 2022 the borrowing base limited the available capacity under the facility to 8119 million the rental revolving credit facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit equal to the greater of 100 million and 50 of the total revolving credit commitments the maturity date of the facility is march 4 2026 the rental revolving credit facility is guaranteed by drh rental’s whollyowned subsidiaries that are not immaterial subsidiaries or have not been designated as unrestricted subsidiaries the rental revolving credit facility is not guaranteed by dr horton inc or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee the debt of our homebuilding forestar or financial services operations 

our mortgage subsidiary utilizes a 16 billion mortgage repurchase facility to finance the majority of the loans it originates the capacity of the facility automatically increases during certain higher volume periods and can be further increased through additional commitments the total capacity of the facility at september 30 2022 was 22 billion and its maturity date is february 17 2023 adverse changes in market conditions could make the renewal of these facilities more difficult or could result in an increase in the cost of these facilities or a decrease in the committed amounts such changes affecting our mortgage repurchase facility may also make it more difficult or costly to sell the mortgages that we originate the mortgage repurchase facility is not guaranteed by dr horton inc or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee the debt of our homebuilding forestar or rental operations 

we regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund growth in our business repay debt obligations pay dividends repurchase our common stock and support other general corporate and operational needs and we regularly evaluate our opportunities to raise additional capital dr horton has an automatically effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec in july 2021 registering debt and equity securities that may be issued from time to time in amounts to be determined forestar also has an effective shelf registration statement filed with the sec in october 2021 registering 750 million of equity securities of which 300 million was reserved for sales under its atthemarket equity offering program that became effective in november 2021 at september 30 2022 7482 million remained available for issuance under forestar’s shelf registration statement of which 2982 million was reserved for sales under its atthemarket equity offering program as market conditions permit we may issue new debt or equity securities through the capital markets or obtain additional bank financing to fund our projected capital requirements or provide additional liquidity we believe that our existing cash resources together with the homebuilding forestar and rental revolving credit facilities mortgage repurchase facility and ability to access the capital markets or obtain additional financing will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our nearterm working capital needs and debt obligations adverse changes in economic homebuilding or capital market conditions could negatively affect our business liquidity and financial results restrict our ability to obtain additional capital or increase our costs of capital 

reductions in the availability of mortgage financing provided by government agencies changes in government financing programs a decrease in our ability to sell mortgage loans on attractive terms or an increase in mortgage interest rates could decrease our buyers’ ability to obtain financing and adversely affect our business or financial results 

the mortgage loans originated by our financial services operations are primarily eligible for sale to fannie mae freddie mac or ginnie mae and are typically sold to thirdparty purchasers the secondary market for mortgage loans continues to primarily desire securities backed by fannie mae freddie mac or ginnie mae and we believe the liquidity these agencies provide to the mortgage industry is important to the housing market any significant change regarding the longterm structure and viability of fannie mae and freddie mac could result in adjustments to the size of their loan portfolios and to guidelines for their loan products additionally a reduction in the availability of financing provided by these institutions could adversely affect interest rates mortgage availability and sales of new homes and mortgage loans during fiscal 2022 approximately 62 of our mortgage loans were sold directly to fannie mae freddie mac or into securities backed by ginnie mae and 30 were sold to one other major financial entity on an ongoing basis we seek to establish loan purchase arrangements with additional financial entities if we are unable to sell mortgage loans to purchasers on attractive terms our ability to originate and sell mortgage loans at competitive prices could be limited which would negatively affect our profitability 

the fha insures mortgage loans that generally have lower credit requirements and is an important source for financing the sale of our homes changes restrictions or significant premium increases in fha programs in the future may negatively affect the availability or affordability of fha financing which could adversely affect our ability to sell homes 

some of our customers may qualify for 100 financing through programs offered by the va and the usda and certain other housing finance agencies these programs are subject to changes in regulations lending standards and government funding levels there can be no assurances that these programs or other programs will continue to be available in our homebuilding markets or that they will be as attractive to our customers as the programs currently offered which could negatively affect our sales 

mortgage interest rates have increased significantly during fiscal 2022 and market conditions and government actions could cause mortgage rates to rise even further in the future when interest rates increase the cost of owning a home increases which reduces the number of potential homebuyers who can obtain mortgage financing and can result in a decline in the demand for our homes 

the risks associated with our land lot and rental inventory could adversely affect our business or financial results 

inventory risks are substantial for our homebuilding forestar and rental businesses there are risks inherent in controlling owning and developing land if housing demand declines we may not be able to sell homes or rental properties profitably in some of our communities and we may not be able to fully recover the costs of some of the land and lots we own also the values of our owned undeveloped land lots and inventories may fluctuate significantly due to changes in market conditions as a result our deposits for lots controlled through purchase contracts may be put at risk we may have to sell homes rental properties or land for a lower profit margin or record inventory impairment charges on our land and lots a significant deterioration in economic or homebuilding industry conditions may result in substantial inventory impairment charges 

we cannot make any assurances that our growth strategies acquisitions or investments will be successful or will not expose us to additional risks or other negative consequences 

in recent years we have primarily grown our business by increasing our investments in land lot and home inventories in our existing homebuilding markets we have also expanded through investments in new product offerings new geographic markets and the growth of our rental property operations investments in land lots home inventories and rental properties can expose us to risks of economic loss and asset impairments if housing conditions weaken or if we are unsuccessful in implementing our growth strategies 

we have acquired the homebuilding operations of several homebuilding companies in recent years and in may 2022 we acquired vidler water resources inc vidler for a total purchase price of 2905 million the assets acquired through the vidler transaction consisted primarily of water rights and other waterrelated assets 

we may make strategic acquisitions of or investments in other companies operations or assets in the future such acquisitions and investments may have risks similar to those related to land lots and home inventories but they may also expose us to additional risks or other negative consequences these transactions may not advance our business strategy provide a satisfactory return on our investment or provide other benefits we anticipate also the integration of these transactions may not be successful and may require significant time and resources which may divert management’s attention from other operations acquisitions and investments could also raise new compliancerelated obligations or expose us to material liabilities not discovered in the due diligence process that may lead to litigation if these transactions underperform our expectations or are unsuccessful we may incur significant expenses or writeoffs of inventory other assets or intangible assets such as goodwill acquisitions and investments can result in dilution to existing stockholders if we issue our common stock as consideration and can increase our debt levels or reduce our liquidity if we purchase them with cash the magnitude timing and nature of any future acquisitions or investments will depend on a number of factors including our ability to identify suitable additional markets or acquisition candidates the negotiation of acceptable terms our financial position and general economic and business conditions we also may seek to divest an investment or a business and may have difficulty selling such investment or business on acceptable terms in a timely manner 

our business and financial results could be adversely affected by significant inflation higher interest rates or deflation 

inflation can adversely affect us by increasing costs of land materials and labor in addition significant inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates which have a negative impact on housing affordability during fiscal 2022 we began to see a moderation in housing demand as inflationary pressures and mortgage interest rates increased in an inflationary environment depending on industry and other economic conditions we may be precluded from raising home prices enough to keep up with the rate of inflation which could reduce our profit margins moreover in an inflationary environment our cost of capital labor and materials can increase and the purchasing power of our cash resources can decline which can have an adverse impact on our business or financial results 

alternatively a significant period of deflation could cause a decrease in overall spending and borrowing levels this could lead to deterioration in economic conditions including an increase in the rate of unemployment deflation could also cause the value of our inventories to decline or reduce the value of existing homes below the related mortgage loan balance which could potentially increase the supply of existing homes these or other factors related to deflation could have a negative impact on our business or financial results 

supply shortages and other risks related to acquiring land building materials and skilled labor could increase our costs and delay deliveries 

the homebuilding and lot development industries have from time to time experienced significant difficulties that can affect the cost or timing of construction including 

• difficulty in acquiring land suitable for residential building at affordable prices in locations where our potential customers want to live 

• shortages of qualified subcontractors 

• reliance on local subcontractors manufacturers distributors and land developers who may be inadequately capitalized 

• shortages of materials and 

• significant increases in the cost of materials particularly increases in the price of lumber drywall and cement which are significant components of home construction costs 

during fiscal 2021 and 2022 we have experienced multiple disruptions in our supply chain which have resulted in shortages of certain building materials and tightness in the labor market this has caused our construction cycle to lengthen and costs of building materials to increase if shortages and cost increases in building materials and tightness in the labor market persist for a prolonged period of time our profit margins could be adversely impacted if we are unable to offset cost increases by increasing the selling price of our homes 

in addition tariffs duties andor trade restrictions imposed or increased on imported materials and goods that are used in connection with the construction and delivery of our homes including steel aluminum and lumber may raise our costs for these items or for the products made with them these factors may cause construction delays or cause us to incur more costs building our homes 

public health issues such as a major epidemic or pandemic could adversely affect our business or financial results 

the us and other countries have experienced and may experience in the future outbreaks of contagious diseases that affect public health and public perception of health risk the ongoing covid19 pandemic continues to affect the global economy the effects of the pandemic contributed to disrupting our supply chain which has resulted in shortages of certain building materials and tightness in the labor market 

there is uncertainty regarding the extent to which and how long covid19 and its variant strains will continue to impact the global economy and our supply chain and the effect of the pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments including its impact on our customers trade partners and employees all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted if covid19 and its variant strains continue to have a negative impact on economic conditions our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted 

our business and financial results could be adversely affected by weather conditions and natural disasters 

physical risks including weather conditions and natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes volcanic activity droughts floods hailstorms heavy or prolonged precipitation wildfires and others can harm our business additionally the physical impacts of climate change may cause these occurrences to increase in frequency severity and duration any such events can temporarily delay our development work home construction and home closings unfavorably affect the cost or availability of materials or labor damage homes under construction lead to changing consumer preferences andor negatively impact demand for new homes in affected areas we have experienced temporary delays in production and shortterm impacts on our sales and closings activity from weather events in recent years however there have been no material lasting impacts on our business from these events or material permanent operational challenges resulting from these events but they could adversely affect our business in the future the climates and geology of many of the states in which we operate including california florida texas and other coastal areas where we have some of our larger operations and which have experienced recent natural disasters present increased risks of adverse weather or natural disasters 

homebuilding is subject to home warranty and construction defect claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant 

we are subject to home warranty and construction defect claims arising in the ordinary course of our homebuilding business we rely on subcontractors to perform the actual construction of our homes and in many cases to select and obtain construction materials despite our detailed specifications and monitoring of the construction process our subcontractors occasionally do not meet adequate quality standards in the construction of our homes when we find these issues we repair them in accordance with our warranty obligations we spend significant resources to repair items in homes we have sold to fulfill the warranties we issued to our homebuyers additionally we are subject to construction defect claims which can be costly to defend and resolve in the legal system warranty and construction defect matters can also result in negative publicity in the media and on the internet which can damage our reputation and adversely affect our ability to sell homes 

based on the large number of homes we have sold over the years our potential liabilities related to warranty and construction defect claims are significant consequently we have generally maintained product liability insurance each year and we seek to obtain indemnities and certificates of insurance from subcontractors covering claims related to their workmanship and materials we establish warranty and other reserves for the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built because of the uncertainties inherent to these matters we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will be adequate to address all of our future warranty and construction defect claims contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce we may be responsible for applicable selfinsured retentions and some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits additionally the coverage offered by and the availability of product liability insurance for construction defects is limited and costly we have responded to increases in insurance costs and coverage limitations by selfinsuring our risk for certain years and by increasing our selfinsured retentions and claim reserves there can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted or become more costly if costs to resolve our future warranty and construction defect claims exceed our estimates our financial results and liquidity could be adversely affected 

a health and safety incident relating to our operations could be costly in terms of potential liability and reputational damage 

  

building and land development sites are inherently dangerous and operating in this industry poses certain inherent health and safety risks due to health and safety regulatory requirements and the number of homes we construct health and safety performance is critical to the success of our business any failure in health and safety performance may result in penalties for noncompliance with relevant regulatory requirements and a failure that results in a major or significant health and safety incident is likely to be costly and could expose us to liability that could be costly such an incident could generate significant negative publicity and have a corresponding impact on our reputation our relationships with relevant regulatory agencies or governmental authorities and our ability to attract customers and employees which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and liquidity 

we are required to obtain performance bonds the unavailability of which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

we often are required to provide surety bonds to secure our performance or obligations under construction contracts development agreements and other arrangements at september 30 2022 we had 28 billion of outstanding surety bonds our ability to obtain surety bonds primarily depends upon our credit rating financial condition past performance and other factors including the capacity of the surety market and the underwriting practices of surety bond issuers the ability to obtain surety bonds also can be impacted by the willingness of insurance companies to issue performance bonds for construction and development activities if we are unable to obtain surety bonds when required our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

increases in the costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business or financial results 

significant expenses of owning a home including mortgage loan interest and state and local income and property taxes have historically been deductible expenses for an individual’s federal income taxes subject to various limitations the tax cuts and jobs act which became effective january 1 2018 established new limits on these federal tax deductions further changes in income tax laws by the federal or state government to eliminate or substantially reduce income tax benefits associated with homeownership could adversely affect demand for and sales prices of new homes 

in addition increases in property tax rates by local governmental authorities as experienced in some areas in response to reduced federal and state funding could adversely affect the amount of financing our potential customers could obtain or their desire to purchase new homes 

further existing and prospective regulatory and societal responses to climate change intended to reduce potential climate change impacts may increase the upfront costs of purchasing a home costs to maintain the home and its systems energy and utility costs and the cost to obtain homeowner and various hazard and flood insurance or limit homeowners’ ability to obtain these insurance policies altogether although these items have had no material effect on our business they could adversely affect our business in the future 

governmental regulations and environmental matters could increase the cost and limit the availability of our land development and homebuilding projects and adversely affect our business or financial results 

we are subject to extensive and complex regulations that affect land development and home construction including zoning density restrictions building design and building standards these regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities as to the conditions we must meet prior to development or construction being approved if approved at all we are subject to determinations by these authorities as to the adequacy of water or sewage facilities roads or other local services new housing developments may also be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets and other public improvements in addition in many markets government authorities have implemented no growth or growth control initiatives any of these may limit delay or increase the costs of development or home construction 

we are also subject to a significant number and variety of local state and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of health safety labor standards and the environment the impact of environmental laws varies depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available these matters may result in delays may cause us to incur substantial compliance remediation mitigation and other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas government agencies also routinely initiate audits reviews or investigations of our business practices to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations which can cause us to incur costs or create other disruptions in our business that can be significant 

recently there has been growing concern from advocacy groups government agencies and the general public over the effects of climate change on the environment transition risks such as government restrictions standards or regulations intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and potential climate change impacts are emerging and may increase in the future in the form of restrictions or additional requirements on land development and home construction in certain areas such restrictions and requirements could increase our operating and compliance costs or require additional technology and capital investment which could adversely affect our results of operations this is a particular concern in the western united states where some of the most extensive and stringent environmental laws and residential building construction standards in the country have been enacted and where we have business operations we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with existing climaterelated government restrictions standards and regulations applicable to our business and such compliance has not had a material impact on our business however given the rapidly changing nature of environmental laws and matters that may arise that are not currently known we cannot predict our future exposure concerning such matters and our future costs to achieve compliance or remedy potential violations could be significant 

additionally actual or perceived esg and other sustainability matters and our response to these matters could harm our business increasing governmental and societal attention to esg matters including expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting diligence and disclosure on topics such as climate change human capital labor and risk oversight could expand the nature scope and complexity of matters that we are required to control assess and report these factors may alter the environment in which we do business and may increase the ongoing costs of compliance and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows if we are unable to adequately address such esg matters or fail to comply with all laws regulations policies and related interpretations it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results 

the subcontractors we rely on to perform the actual construction of our homes are also subject to a significant number of local state and federal laws and regulations including laws involving matters that are not within our control if the subcontractors who construct our homes fail to comply with all applicable laws we can suffer reputational damage and may be exposed to possible liability 

we are also subject to an extensive number of laws and regulations because our common stock and debt securities and the common stock of our forestar subsidiary are publicly traded in the capital markets these regulations govern our communications with our shareholders and the capital markets our financial statement disclosures and our legal processes and they also impact the work required to be performed by our independent registered public accounting firm and our legal counsel changes in these laws and regulations including the subsequent implementation of rules by the administering government authorities may require us to incur additional compliance costs and such costs may be significant 

governmental regulation of our financial services operations could adversely affect our business or financial results 

our financial services operations are subject to extensive state and federal laws and regulations which are administered by numerous agencies including but not limited to the consumer financial protection bureau federal housing finance agency us department of housing and urban development fha va usda fannie mae freddie mac and ginnie mae these laws and regulations include many compliance requirements including but not limited to licensing consumer disclosures fair lending and real estate settlement procedures as a result our operations are subject to regular extensive examinations by the applicable agencies additional future regulations or changing rule interpretations and examinations by regulatory agencies may result in more stringent compliance standards and could adversely affect the results of our operations 

we operate in competitive industries and competitive conditions could adversely affect our business or financial results 

the homebuilding lot development and rental housing industries are highly competitive we compete not only for homebuyers and renters but also for desirable properties raw materials skilled labor and financing we compete with local regional and national companies in these industries and also with existing home sales foreclosures and rental properties the competitive conditions in these industries can negatively affect our sales volumes selling prices leased occupancy levels rental rates and incentive levels reduce our profit margins and cause the value of our inventory or other assets to be impaired competition can also affect our ability to acquire suitable land raw materials and skilled labor at acceptable prices or terms or cause delays in land development or in construction 

the competitors to our financial services businesses include other mortgage lenders and title companies including national regional and local mortgage banks and other financial institutions some of these competitors are subject to fewer governmental regulations and have greater access to capital than we do may operate with different lending criteria andor may offer a broader or more attractive array of financing and other products and services to potential customers 

our businesses compete with other companies across all industries to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced employees managers and executives competition for the services of these individuals increases as business conditions improve in the homebuilding lot development financial services and rental housing industries and in the general economy if we are unable to attract and retain key employees managers or executives our business could be adversely affected 

risks related to our indebtedness 

we have significant amounts of debt and may incur additional debt which could affect our financial health and our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations or potential acquisitions 

as of september 30 2022 our consolidated debt was 61 billion which consisted of 29 billion related to our homebuilding segment 706 million related to our forestar segment 800 million related to our rental segment and 16 billion related to our financial services segment the indentures governing our homebuilding senior notes do not restrict the incurrence of future unsecured debt by us or our homebuilding subsidiaries or the incurrence of secured or unsecured debt by our nonguarantor subsidiaries and the agreement governing our homebuilding revolving credit facility allows us to incur a substantial amount of future unsecured debt also the indentures governing our homebuilding senior notes and the agreement governing our homebuilding revolving credit facility impose restrictions on our ability and on that of the guarantors under our homebuilding senior notes and our homebuilding revolving credit facility to incur debt secured by certain assets but still permit us and our homebuilding subsidiaries to incur significant amounts of additional secured debt the forestar revolving credit facility and the indentures governing forestar’s senior notes impose restrictions on the ability of forestar and its restricted subsidiaries to incur secured and unsecured debt but still permit forestar and its restricted subsidiaries to incur a substantial amount of future secured and unsecured debt and do not restrict the incurrence of future secured and unsecured debt by forestar’s unrestricted subsidiaries the rental revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on the ability of drh rental and its restricted subsidiaries to incur secured and unsecured debt but still permits drh rental and its restricted subsidiaries to incur a substantial amount of future secured and unsecured debt and does not restrict the incurrence of future secured and unsecured debt by drh rental’s unrestricted subsidiaries the mortgage repurchase facility imposes restrictions on the ability of dhi mortgage and its restricted subsidiaries to incur secured and unsecured debt but still permits dhi mortgage and its restricted subsidiaries to incur a substantial amount of future secured and unsecured debt and does not restrict the incurrence of future secured and unsecured debt by dhi mortgage’s unrestricted subsidiaries 

the amount and the maturities of our debt and the debt of our subsidiaries could have important consequences for example possible consequences for our homebuilding forestar financial services and rental operations each with respect to their individual debt obligations could 

• require the dedication of a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to payment of debt and reduce the ability to use cash flow for other operating or investing purposes 

• limit the flexibility to adjust to changes in business or economic conditions and 

• limit the ability to obtain future financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions debt service requirements or other requirements 

servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash and we or our subsidiaries may not have sufficient cash flow from our respective businesses to pay our substantial debt 

our ability and that of our subsidiaries to meet our respective debt service obligations will depend in part upon our and our subsidiaries’ future financial performance future results are subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report our revenues and earnings vary with the level of general economic activity in the markets we serve our businesses are also affected by financial political business and other factors many of which are beyond our control the factors that affect our ability to generate cash can also affect our ability to raise additional funds for these purposes through the sale of debt or equity the refinancing of debt or the sale of assets changes in prevailing interest rates may affect the cost of our debt service obligations because borrowings under the homebuilding forestar and rental revolving credit facilities and mortgage repurchase facility bear interest at floating rates 

the instruments governing our and our subsidiaries’ indebtedness impose certain restrictions on our and our subsidiaries’ business and the ability of us and our subsidiaries to comply with related covenants restrictions or limitations could adversely affect our and our subsidiaries’ financial condition or operating flexibility 

the restrictions imposed by our and certain of our subsidiaries’ indebtedness could limit our or our subsidiaries’ ability to plan for or react to market or economic conditions or meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans and adversely affect our or our subsidiaries’ ability to finance our operations acquisitions investments or strategic alliances or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest 

the agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on our and our guarantor subsidiaries’ ability to among other things engage in sale and leaseback transactions with respect to certain assets incur secured debt create liens pay dividends and make other distributions on or redeem or repurchase equity securities sell certain assets and engage in mergers consolidations or sales of all or substantially all of our assets the applicable instruments governing each of forestar’s indebtedness and drh rental’s indebtedness contain restrictions on the ability of forestar and drh rental as applicable and certain of their respective subsidiaries to among other things incur additional indebtedness create liens pay dividends and make other distributions on or redeem or repurchase equity securities sell certain assets enter into affiliate transactions and engage in mergers consolidations or sales of all or substantially all of forestar’s or drh rental’s assets as applicable 

in addition the agreements governing certain of our and our subsidiaries’ debt instruments contain the following financial covenants 

homebuilding revolving credit facility our homebuilding revolving credit facility contains financial covenants requiring the maintenance of a maximum allowable leverage ratio and a borrowing base restriction if our leverage ratio exceeds a certain level a failure to comply with these financial covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under the revolving credit facility or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity 

forestar and rental revolving credit facilities the forestar and rental revolving credit facilities each contain financial covenants requiring the maintenance by forestar or drh rental as applicable of a minimum level of tangible net worth a minimum level of liquidity a maximum allowable leverage ratio and a borrowing base restriction based on the book value of forestar’s or drh rental’s real estate assets and unrestricted cash a failure to comply with these financial covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under the applicable revolving credit facility or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity 

mortgage repurchase facility and other restrictions the mortgage repurchase facility for our mortgage subsidiary requires the maintenance of a minimum level of tangible net worth a maximum allowable leverage ratio and a minimum level of liquidity by our mortgage subsidiary a failure to comply with these requirements could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds to our mortgage subsidiary or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity any difficulty experienced in complying with these covenants could make the renewal of the facility more difficult or costly 

in addition although our financial services business is conducted through subsidiaries that are not restricted by the indentures governing our and forestar’s senior notes or the agreements governing the homebuilding forestar and rental revolving credit facilities the ability of our financial services subsidiaries to distribute funds to our homebuilding operations would be restricted in the event such distribution would cause an event of default under the mortgage repurchase facility or if an event of default had occurred under this facility moreover our right to receive assets from our financial services subsidiaries upon their liquidation or recapitalization is subject to the prior claims of the creditors of these subsidiaries any claims we may have to funds from our financial services subsidiaries would be subordinate to subsidiary indebtedness to the extent of any security for such indebtedness and to any indebtedness otherwise recognized as senior to our claims 

our access to capital and our ability to obtain additional financing could be affected by any downgrade of our debt ratings 

our homebuilding senior unsecured debt is currently rated investment grade by all three major rating agencies however there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain these ratings any lowering of our debt ratings could make accessing the public capital markets or obtaining additional credit from banks more difficult andor more expensive any lowering of forestar’s debt ratings could also make forestar’s ability to access the public capital markets or obtain additional credit from banks more difficult andor more expensive 

the instruments governing our indebtedness contain change of control provisions which could affect the timing of repayment 

change of control purchase options under our homebuilding senior notes and change of control default under our homebuilding revolving credit facility upon the occurrence of both a change of control and a ratings downgrade event each as defined in the indentures governing our homebuilding senior notes we will be required to offer to repurchase such notes at 101 of their principal amount together with all accrued and unpaid interest if any moreover a change of control as defined in our homebuilding revolving credit facility would constitute an event of default under our homebuilding revolving credit facility which could result in the acceleration of the repayment of any borrowings outstanding under the facility a requirement to cash collateralize all letters of credit outstanding thereunder and the termination of the commitments thereunder if repayment of more than 50 million outstanding under our homebuilding revolving credit facility were accelerated and such acceleration were not rescinded or such indebtedness were not satisfied in either case within 30 days an event of default would result under the indentures governing our homebuilding senior notes entitling the trustee for the notes or holders of at least 25 in principal amount of the relevant series of notes then outstanding to declare all such notes to be due and payable immediately if purchase offers were required under the indentures for our homebuilding senior notes repayment of the borrowings under our homebuilding revolving credit facility were required or if the senior notes were accelerated we can give no assurance that we would have sufficient funds to pay the required amounts 

change of control purchase option under forestar’s notes and change of control default under the forestar revolving credit facility upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event as defined in the indentures governing forestar’s notes forestar will be required to offer to repurchase forestar’s notes at 101 of their principal amount together with all accrued and unpaid interest if any a change of control as defined in the forestar revolving credit facility with respect to forestar would constitute an event of default under the forestar revolving credit facility which could result in the acceleration of the repayment of any borrowings outstanding under the forestar revolving credit facility a requirement to cash collateralize all letters of credit outstanding thereunder and the termination of the commitments thereunder if the maturity of the forestar revolving credit facility andor other indebtedness of forestar and its restricted subsidiaries together having an aggregate principal amount outstanding of 40 million or more is accelerated an event of default would result under the indentures governing the forestar notes entitling the trustee for the forestar notes or holders of at least 25 in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding forestar notes to declare all such forestar notes to be due and payable immediately if purchase offers were required under the indentures for forestar’s notes repayment of the borrowings under forestar’s revolving credit facility were required or if forestar’s notes were accelerated we can give no assurance that forestar would have sufficient funds to pay the required amounts 

change of control default under the rental revolving credit facility  a change of control as defined in the rental revolving credit facility agreement with respect to drh rental would constitute an event of default under the rental revolving credit facility which could result in the acceleration of the repayment of any borrowings outstanding under the rental revolving credit facility a requirement to cash collateralize all letters of credit outstanding thereunder and the termination of the commitments thereunder if repayment of the borrowings under the rental revolving credit facility were required we can give no assurance that drh rental would have sufficient funds to pay the required amounts 

change of control default under mortgage repurchase facility  a change of control as defined in the mortgage repurchase facility with respect to dhi mortgage would constitute an event of default under the mortgage repurchase facility which could result in the acceleration of the repurchase of any loans outstanding under the facility and an increase in the repurchase price of such loans if repayments of the loans under dhi mortgage’s mortgage repurchase facility were required we can give no assurance that dhi mortgage would have sufficient funds to pay the required amounts

our business could be adversely affected by the loss of key personnel 

we rely on our key personnel to effectively operate and manage our businesses specifically our success depends heavily on the performance of our homebuilding division and region presidents and their management teams our rental housing management team our financial services management team our corporate office management teams our forestar management team and our executive officers these key personnel have significant experience and skills in the homebuilding lot development financial services and rental housing industries as well as leadership and management abilities that are vital to our success our ability to attract and retain our key personnel may be impacted by matters involving reputation culture diversity and inclusion compensation and benefits and our management of executive succession we seek to retain our key personnel and to have succession plans in place to address the potential loss of key personnel however if our retention and succession planning efforts are unsuccessful or if we fail to attract suitable replacements the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business 

our business could be negatively impacted as a result of actions by activist stockholders or others 

we may be subject to actions or proposals from activist stockholders or others that may not align with our business strategies or the interests of our other stockholders responding to such actions could be costly and timeconsuming disrupt our business and operations andor divert the attention of our board of directors and senior management from the pursuit of our business strategies activist stockholders may create perceived uncertainties as to the future direction of our business or strategy including with respect to our esg efforts which may be exploited by our competitors and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel potential homebuyers and business partners and may affect our relationships with current homebuyers subcontractors investors and other third parties in addition actions of activist stockholders may cause periods of fluctuation in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business 

information technology failures data security breaches and the failure to satisfy privacy and data protection laws and regulations could harm our business 

we use information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational and marketing activities and to maintain our business records these information technology systems are dependent upon global communications providers web browsers thirdparty software and data storage providers and other aspects of the internet infrastructure that have experienced security breaches cyberattacks ransomware attacks significant systems failures and service outages in the past additionally phishing attacks whereby perpetrators attempt to fraudulently induce employees customers vendors or other users of a company’s systems to disclose sensitive information to gain access to its data have become more prevalent in recent years the use of remote work environments and virtual platforms may increase our risk of cyberattack or data security breaches further geopolitical tensions or conflicts such as the ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine may create a heightened risk of cyberattacks or other data security breaches our normal business activities involve collecting and storing information specific to our homebuyers renters employees vendors and suppliers and maintaining operational and financial information related to our business both in 

an office setting and remote locations as needed a material breach in the security of our information technology systems or other data security controls could include the theft or release of this information the unintended or unauthorized disclosure of personal identifying and confidential information as a result of a security breach by any means could lead to litigation or other proceedings against us by the affected individuals or business partners or by regulators the outcome of such proceedings which could include penalties or fines could have a significant negative impact on our business 

we may also be required to incur significant costs to protect against damages caused by information technology failures security breaches and the failure to satisfy privacy and data protection laws and regulations in the future as legal requirements continue to increase the european union and other international regulators as well as state governments have enacted or enhanced data privacy regulations such as the california consumer privacy act and its successor the california privacy rights act which will go into effect on january 1 2023 and other governments are considering establishing similar or stronger protections these regulations impose certain obligations for handling specified personal information in our systems including notifying individuals regarding information we have collected from them we have incurred costs in an effort to comply with these requirements but our costs may increase significantly if new requirements are enacted and based on how individuals exercise their rights any noncompliance could result in substantial penalties reputational damage or litigation 

we provide employee awareness training about cybersecurity threats we routinely utilize information technology security experts to assist us in our evaluations of the effectiveness of the security of our information technology systems and we regularly enhance our security measures to protect our systems and data we use various encryption tokenization and authentication technologies to mitigate cybersecurity risks and have increased our monitoring capabilities to enhance early detection and rapid response to potential cyber threats however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade systems change frequently and are increasing in sophistication they often are not recognized until launched against a target as such we may be unable to anticipate these techniques to implement adequate preventative measures or to identify and investigate cybersecurity incidents 

although past cybersecurity incidents have not had a material effect on our business or operations to date in the future a data security breach a significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems or a breach of any of our data security controls could disrupt our business operations damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers we cannot provide assurances that a security breach cyberattack data theft or other significant systems or security failures will not occur in the future and such occurrences could have a material and adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position

results of operations — overview 

fiscal 2022 operating results 

in fiscal 2022 our number of homes closed and home sales revenues increased 1 and 20 respectively compared to the prior year and our consolidated revenues increased 21 to 335 billion compared to 278 billion in the prior year our pretax income was 76 billion in fiscal 2022 compared to 54 billion in fiscal 2021 and our pretax operating margin was 228 compared to 193 net income was 59 billion in fiscal 2022 compared to 42 billion in fiscal 2021 and our diluted earnings per share was 1651 compared to 1141 

consolidated net cash provided by operating activities was 5618 million in fiscal 2022 and 5344 million in fiscal 2021 and cash provided by our homebuilding operations was 19 billion in fiscal 2022 compared to 12 billion in fiscal 2021 in fiscal 2022 our return on equity roe was 345 compared to 316 in fiscal 2021 and our homebuilding return on inventory roi was 428 compared to 379 roe is calculated as net income attributable to dr horton for the year divided by average stockholders’ equity where average stockholders’ equity is the sum of ending stockholders’ equity balances of the trailing five quarters divided by five homebuilding roi is calculated as homebuilding pretax income for the year divided by average inventory where average inventory is the sum of ending homebuilding inventory balances for the trailing five quarters divided by five 

during the first half of fiscal 2022 and for most of the third quarter demand for our homes remained strong in june 2022 we began to see a moderation in housing demand that persisted through the end of our fiscal year as mortgage interest rates increased substantially and inflationary pressures remained elevated the supply of homes at affordable price points remains limited across most of our markets and disruptions in the supply chains for certain building materials and tightness in the labor market have caused our construction cycle to lengthen although these pressures may persist for some time we believe we are wellpositioned to meet these changing market conditions with our affordable product offerings and lot supply and we will manage our home pricing sales incentives and number of homes in inventory based on the level of homebuyer demand 

within our homebuilding land and lot portfolio our lots controlled through purchase contracts represent 77 of the lots owned and controlled at september 30 2022 compared to 76 at september 30 2021 our relationship with forestar and expanded relationships with other land developers across the country have allowed us to significantly increase the controlled portion of our lot pipeline over the past few years 

we believe our strong balance sheet and liquidity position provide us with the flexibility to operate effectively through changing economic conditions we plan to continue to generate strong cash flows from our homebuilding operations and manage our product offerings incentives home pricing sales pace and inventory levels to optimize the return on our inventory investments in each of our communities based on local housing market conditions 

strategy 

our operating strategy focuses on enhancing longterm value to our shareholders by leveraging our financial and competitive position to maximize the returns on our inventory investments and generate strong profitability and cash flows while managing risk and maintaining financial flexibility to navigate changing economic conditions our strategy remains consistent and includes the following initiatives 

• developing and retaining highly experienced and productive teams of personnel throughout our company that are aligned and focused on continuous improvement in our operational execution and financial performance 

• maintaining a significant cash balance and strong overall liquidity position while controlling our level of debt 

• allocating and actively managing our inventory investments across our operating markets to diversify our geographic risk 

• offering new home communities that appeal to a broad range of entrylevel moveup active adult and luxury homebuyers based on consumer demand in each market 

• modifying product offerings sales pace home prices and sales incentives as necessary in each of our markets to meet consumer demand and maintain affordability 

• delivering high quality homes and a positive experience to our customers both during and after the sale 

• managing our inventory of homes under construction relative to demand in each of our markets including starting construction on unsold homes to capture new home demand and actively controlling the number of unsold completed homes in inventory 

• investing in lots land and land development in desirable markets while controlling the level of land and lots we own in each market relative to the local new home demand 

• continuing to seek opportunities to expand the portion of our land and finished lots controlled through purchase contracts with forestar and other land developers 

• controlling the cost of goods purchased from both vendors and subcontractors 

• improving the efficiency of our land development construction sales and other key operational activities 

• controlling our selling general and administrative sga expense infrastructure to match production levels 

• ensuring that our financial services business provides high quality mortgage and title services to homebuyers efficiently and effectively 

• investing in the construction and leasing of singlefamily and multifamily rental properties to meet rental demand in high growth suburban markets and selling these properties profitably 

• opportunistically evaluating potential acquisitions to enhance our operating platform 

we believe our operating strategy which has produced positive results in recent years will allow us to successfully operate through changing economic conditions and maintain our strong financial performance and competitive position however we cannot provide any assurances that the initiatives listed above will continue to be successful and we may need to adjust parts of our strategy to meet future market conditions

results of operations — homebuilding 

our operating segments are our 78 homebuilding divisions our majorityowned forestar residential lot development operations our financial services operations our rental operations and our other business activities the homebuilding operating segments are aggregated into six reporting segments these reporting segments which we also refer to as reporting regions have homebuilding operations located in the following states 



the following tables and related discussion set forth key operating and financial data for our homebuilding operations by reporting segment as of and for the fiscal years ended september 30 2022 and 2021 

  

1 net sales orders represent the number and dollar value of new sales contracts executed with customers gross sales orders net of cancelled sales orders 



 

1 cancellation rate represents the number of cancelled sales orders divided by gross sales orders 

net sales orders 

the number of net sales orders decreased 6 during 2022 compared to 2021 and the value of net sales orders increased 9 to 304 billion 76137 homes in 2022 from 277 billion 81378 homes in 2021 due to the increase in our average selling price the average selling price of net sales orders during fiscal 2022 was 398900 up 17 from the prior year 

during the first half of fiscal 2022 and for most of the third quarter demand for our homes remained strong we restricted our sales order pace during the year in most of our communities to match our longer construction cycles which have resulted from disruptions in the supply chains for certain building materials and tightness in the labor market in june 2022 we began to see a moderation in housing demand that persisted through the end of our fiscal year as mortgage interest rates increased substantially and inflationary pressures remained elevated our net sales order volume decreased 15 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to the prior year quarter and the average selling price of net sales orders declined by 4 sequentially in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter although these pressures may persist for some time we believe we are wellpositioned to meet these changing market conditions with our affordable product offerings 

in regions with a decrease in sales order volume the markets contributing most to the decreases were the arizona and california markets in the southwest the austin market in the south central the louisiana markets in the southeast and the atlanta market in the east in the north region the markets contributing most to the increase in sales order volume were the chicago indianapolis new jersey and iowa markets 

our sales order cancellation rate cancelled sales orders divided by gross sales orders for the period was 21 in 2022 compared to 17 in 2021 the increase in the cancellation rate primarily reflects the moderation in demand we experienced beginning in june 2022 as mortgage rates increased substantially and inflationary pressures remained elevated throughout the remainder of the year our cancellation rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 was 32 up sequentially from 24 in the third quarter 



sales order backlog 

sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies including mortgage loan approval and buyers selling their existing homes which can result in cancellations a portion of the contracts in backlog will not result in closings due to cancellations 



home sales revenue 

revenues from home sales increased 20 to 319 billion 82744 homes closed in 2022 from 265 billion 81965 homes closed in 2021 although our homes closed during the year were negatively impacted by supply chain disruptions home sales revenues increased in all of our regions due to an increase in average selling price 

the number of homes closed in 2022 increased 1 from 2021 in regions with an increase in closings volume the markets contributing most to the increases were the dallas market in the south central and the chicago and new jersey markets in the north in regions with a decrease in closings volume the markets contributing most to the decreases were the seattle market in the northwest and the orlando market in the southeast 

homebuilding operating margin analysis 

home sales gross profit 

gross profit from home sales increased to 91 billion in 2022 from 68 billion in 2021 and increased 320 basis points to 287 as a percentage of home sales revenues the percentage increase resulted from improvements of 340 basis points due to the average selling price of our homes closed increasing by more than the average cost of those homes partially offset by increased warranty and construction defect costs of 20 basis points 

we remain focused on managing the pricing incentives and sales pace in each of our communities to optimize the returns on our inventory investments and adjust to local market conditions and new home demand to adjust to market conditions we increased our use of incentives in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and our home sales gross profit margin declined sequentially by 180 basis points from 301 in the third quarter to 283 in the fourth quarter during fiscal 2023 we expect to continue offering a higher level of incentives and also expect our average sales price to decrease which will cause our gross profit margins to decline from current levels 

landlot sales and other revenues 

landlot sales and other revenues from our homebuilding operations were 614 million and 750 million in fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively we continually evaluate our land and lot supply and fluctuations in revenues and profitability from land sales occur based on how we manage our inventory levels in various markets we generally purchase land and lots with the intent to build and sell homes on them however some of the land that we purchase includes commercially zoned parcels that we may sell to commercial developers we may also sell residential lots or land parcels to manage our supply or for other strategic reasons as of september 30 2022 our homebuilding operations had 294 million of land held for sale that we expect to sell in the next twelve months 

inventory and land option charges 

at the end of each quarter we review the performance and outlook for all of our communities and land inventories for indicators of potential impairment and perform detailed impairment evaluations and analyses when necessary as a result of these reviews there were no impairments recorded in our homebuilding segment during the three months ended september 30 2022 or during fiscal 2022 there were 56 million of homebuilding impairment charges recorded in fiscal 2021 

as we manage our inventory investments across our operating markets to optimize returns and cash flows we may modify our pricing and incentives construction and development plans or land sale strategies in individual active communities and land held for development which could result in the affected communities being evaluated for potential impairment if the housing market or economic conditions are adversely affected for a prolonged period we may be required to evaluate additional communities for potential impairment these evaluations could result in impairment charges which could be significant 

during fiscal 2022 and 2021 earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs related to land purchase contracts that we have terminated or expect to terminate were 572 million and 193 million respectively 

selling general and administrative sga expense 

sga expense from homebuilding activities increased 12 to 22 billion in fiscal 2022 from 19 billion in fiscal 2021 sga expense as a percentage of homebuilding revenues was 68 and 73 in fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively 

employee compensation and related costs were 18 billion and 16 billion in fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively representing 82 and 81 of sga costs in those years these costs increased 13 in fiscal 2022 from the prior year period our homebuilding operations employed 9499 and 8429 people at september 30 2022 and 2021 respectively 

we attempt to control our homebuilding sga costs while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports our operations however we cannot make assurances that we will be able to maintain or improve upon the current sga expense as a percentage of revenues 

interest incurred 

we capitalize interest costs incurred to inventory during active development and construction active inventory capitalized interest is charged to cost of sales as the related inventory is delivered to the buyer interest incurred by our homebuilding operations was 1107 million and 936 million in fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively interest charged to cost of sales was 06 and 07 of total cost of sales excluding inventory and land option charges in those years 

other income 

other income net of other expenses included in our homebuilding operations was 164 million in fiscal 2022 compared to 103 million in fiscal 2021 other income consists of interest income and various other types of ancillary income gains expenses and losses not directly associated with sales of homes land and lots the activities that result in this ancillary income are not significant either individually or in the aggregate 

homebuilding results by reporting region 



 

1 expenses maintained at the corporate level consist primarily of interest and property taxes which are capitalized and amortized to cost of sales or expensed directly and the expenses related to operating our corporate office the amortization of capitalized interest and property taxes is allocated to each segment based on the segment’s cost of sales while expenses associated with the corporate office are allocated to each segment based on the segment’s inventory balances

results of operations — financial services 

the following tables and related discussion set forth key operating and financial data for our financial services operations comprising dhi mortgage and our subsidiary title companies for the fiscal years ended september 30 2022 and 2021 





financial services operating margin analysis 

mortgage loan activity 

the volume of loans originated by our mortgage operations is directly related to the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations in fiscal 2022 the volume of firstlien loans originated or brokered by dhi mortgage for our homebuyers increased 5 from the prior year due to an increase in the percentage of homes closed for which dhi mortgage handled our homebuyers’ financing 

homes closed by our homebuilding operations constituted 98 of dhi mortgage loan originations in both fiscal 2022 and 2021 this percentage reflects dhi mortgage’s consistent focus on the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations 

the number of loans sold increased 4 in fiscal 2022 compared to the prior year virtually all of the mortgage loans held for sale on september 30 2022 were eligible for sale to fannie mae freddie mac or ginnie mae during fiscal 2022 approximately 62 of our mortgage loans were sold directly to fannie mae freddie mac or into securities backed by ginnie mae and 30 were sold to one other major financial entity changes in market conditions could result in a greater concentration of our mortgage sales in future periods to fewer financial entities and directly to fannie mae freddie mac or ginnie mae and we may need to make other adjustments to our mortgage operations 

financial services revenues and expenses 

revenues from our mortgage operations decreased 8 to 6174 million in fiscal 2022 from 6708 million in fiscal 2021 primarily due to a more competitive environment in the mortgage industry due to rising interest rates revenues from our title operations increased 16 to 1776 million in fiscal 2022 from 1528 million in fiscal 2021 primarily due to an increase in the average premium collected on closing transactions from higher sales prices of homes closed by our homebuilding operations as well as expansion of our title insurance operations 

general and administrative ga expense related to our financial services operations increased 12 to 5476 million in fiscal 2022 from 4883 million in the prior year as a percentage of financial services revenues ga expense was 689 in fiscal 2022 compared to 593 in the prior year fluctuations in financial services ga expense as a percentage of revenues can occur because some components of revenue fluctuate differently than loan volumes and some expenses are not directly related to mortgage loan volume or to changes in the amount of revenue earned our financial services operations employed 3024 and 2891 people at september 30 2022 and 2021 respectively 

other income net of other expense included in our financial services operations consists primarily of the interest income of our mortgage subsidiary

results of operations — consolidated 

income before income taxes 

pretax income was 76 billion in fiscal 2022 compared to 54 billion in fiscal 2021 the increase was primarily due to an increase in pretax income generated by our homebuilding operations as a result of higher revenues from increased average selling prices and an increase in home sales gross margin in fiscal 2022 our homebuilding financial services forestar and rental businesses generated pretax income of 69 billion 2906 million 2358 million and 2020 million respectively compared to 48 billion 3646 million 1466 million and 865 million respectively in fiscal 2021 

income taxes 

our income tax expense was 17 billion and 12 billion in fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively and our effective tax rate was 227 and 218 in those years the effective tax rates for both years include an expense for state income taxes and tax benefits related to stockbased compensation and federal energy efficient homes tax credits 

the federal energy efficient homes tax credit was retroactively extended to qualifying homes closed from january 1 2022 through december 31 2032 as a result of the enactment of the inflation reduction act ira that was signed into law on august 16 2022 beginning with homes closed after december 31 2022 the requirements to qualify for the energy efficient homes tax credit will be increased we are currently analyzing the impact of the increased requirements on our ability to qualify homes for the credit other tax related provisions of the ira including the corporate alternative minimum tax had no material impact on our financial statements and are not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements in the future 

our deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities were 1590 million at september 30 2022 compared to 1595 million at september 30 2021 we have a valuation allowance of 179 million and 42 million at september 30 2022 and 2021 respectively related to deferred tax assets for state net operating loss nol state capital loss and tax credit carryforwards that are expected to expire before being realized of the 179 million valuation allowance 158 million relates to state nol state capital loss and tax credit carryforwards acquired in the vidler acquisition we will continue to evaluate both the positive and negative evidence in determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to our remaining state nol state capital loss and tax credit carryforwards any reversal of the valuation allowance in future periods will impact our effective tax rate 

we have 309 million of tax benefits for a federal nol carryforward acquired in the vidler acquisition the utilization of the federal nol is subject to irc section 382 limitations however it is expected that all of the federal nol will be utilized within the carryforward period dr horton has 120 million of tax benefits for state nol carryforwards that expire at various times depending on the tax jurisdiction of the total amount 43 million of the tax benefits expire over the next ten years and the remaining 77 million expire from fiscal years 2033 to 2042 forestar has 12 million of tax benefits for state nol carryforwards that expire at various times depending on the tax jurisdiction 

the accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future results could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position also changes in existing federal and state tax laws and tax rates could affect future tax results and the valuation of our deferred tax assets 

unrecognized tax benefits are the differences between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefits recognized in our financial statements our unrecognized tax benefits totaled 29 million at both september 30 2022 and 2021 

dr horton is subject to federal income tax and state income tax in multiple jurisdictions the statute of limitations for dr horton’s major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for fiscal years 2018 through 2022 an audit by the internal revenue service of a federal refund claim related to the retroactive extension of energy efficient homes tax credits for fiscal 2018 and additional energy efficient tax credits for fiscal 2017 was completed during the current fiscal year with no material adjustments dr horton is under audit by various states however we are not aware of any significant findings by the state taxing authorities 

forestar is subject to federal income tax and state income tax in multiple jurisdictions the statute of limitations for forestar’s federal income tax remains open for examination for tax years 2019 through 2022 the statute of limitations for forestar’s major state tax jurisdictions generally remain open for examination for tax years 2017 through 2022 forestar is not currently under audit for federal or state income taxes 

capital resources and liquidity 

we have historically funded our operations with cash flows from operating activities borrowings under bank credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities our current levels of cash borrowing capacity and balance sheet leverage provide us with the operational flexibility to adjust to changes in economic and market conditions 

we have continued to increase our investments in homebuilding inventories and singlefamily and multifamily rental properties to expand our operations and grow our revenues and profitability we are also returning capital to our shareholders through dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock we are maintaining significant homebuilding cash balances and liquidity to support the increased scale and level of activity in our business and to provide flexibility to adjust to changing conditions and opportunities

at september 30 2022 we had outstanding letters of credit of 2733 million and surety bonds of 28 billion issued by third parties to secure performance under various contracts we expect that our performance obligations secured by these letters of credit and bonds will generally be completed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms when we complete our performance obligations the related letters of credit and bonds are generally released shortly thereafter leaving us with no continuing obligations we have no material thirdparty guarantees 

we regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund growth in our business repay debt obligations pay dividends repurchase our common stock and maintain sufficient cash and liquidity levels to support our other operational needs and we regularly evaluate our opportunities to raise additional capital dr horton has an automatically effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec in july 2021 registering debt and equity securities that may be issued from time to time in amounts to be determined forestar also has an effective shelf registration statement filed with the sec in october 2021 registering 750 million of equity securities of which 300 million was reserved for sales under its atthemarket equity offering program that became effective in november 2021 at september 30 2022 7482 million remained available for issuance under forestar’s shelf registration statement of which 2982 million was reserved for sales under its atthemarket equity offering program as market conditions permit we may issue new debt or equity securities through the capital markets or obtain additional bank financing to fund our projected capital requirements or provide additional liquidity we believe that our existing cash resources revolving credit facilities mortgage repurchase facility and ability to access the capital markets or obtain additional bank financing will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our nearterm working capital needs and debt obligations for the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future

in fiscal 2022 net cash used in financing activities was 8112 million consisting primarily of repayments of amounts drawn on our homebuilding revolving credit facility totaling 35 billion cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock of 11 billion repayment of 350 million principal amount of our 4375 homebuilding senior notes at maturity and payment of cash dividends totaling 3165 million these uses of cash were partially offset by draws on our homebuilding revolving credit facility of 35 billion draws on drh rental’s revolving credit facility of 800 million and net advances on our mortgage repurchase facility of 1237 million 

in fiscal 2021 net cash used in financing activities was 851 million consisting primarily of repayment of 400 million principal amount of our 255 homebuilding senior notes at maturity forestar’s redemption of its 350 million principal amount of 80 senior notes cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock of 8484 million and payment of cash dividends totaling 2893 million these uses of cash were partially offset by note proceeds from our issuance of 500 million principal amount of 14 homebuilding senior notes and 600 million principal amount of 13 homebuilding senior notes forestar’s issuance of 400 million principal amount of 385 senior notes and net advances of 3620 million on our mortgage repurchase facility 

our board of directors approved and paid quarterly cash dividends of 0225 per common share in fiscal 2022 and 020 per common share in fiscal 2021 in october 2022 our board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of 025 per common share payable on december 12 2022 to stockholders of record on december 2 2022 the declaration of future cash dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon among other things our future earnings cash flows capital requirements financial condition and general business conditions 

supplemental guarantor financial information 

as of september 30 2022 dr horton inc had 28 billion principal amount of homebuilding senior notes outstanding due through october 2027 and no amounts outstanding on its homebuilding revolving credit facility 

all of the homebuilding senior notes and the homebuilding revolving credit facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by certain subsidiaries of dr horton inc guarantors or guarantor subsidiaries each of the guarantor subsidiaries is 100 owned directly or indirectly by dr horton inc our subsidiaries associated with the forestar lot development operations financial services operations multifamily and singlefamily rental operations and certain other subsidiaries do not guarantee the homebuilding senior notes or the homebuilding revolving credit facility collectively nonguarantor subsidiaries the guarantees are senior unsecured obligations of each guarantor and rank equal with all existing and future senior debt of such guarantor and senior to all subordinated debt of such guarantor the guarantees are effectively subordinated to any secured debt of such guarantor to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt the guarantees will be structurally subordinated to indebtedness and other liabilities of nonguarantor subsidiaries of the guarantors 

the guarantees by a guarantor subsidiary will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon 1 the sale or other disposition of its common stock whereby it is no longer a subsidiary of ours 2 the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets other than to us or another guarantor 3 its merger or consolidation with an entity other than us or another guarantor or 4 its ceasing to guarantee any of our publicly traded debt securities and ceasing to guarantee any of our obligations under our homebuilding revolving credit facility 

the enforceability of the obligations of the guarantor subsidiaries under their guarantees may be subject to review under applicable federal or state laws relating to fraudulent conveyance or transfer voidable preference and similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally in certain circumstances a court could void the guarantees subordinate amounts owing under the guarantees or order other relief detrimental to the holders of our guaranteed obligations the indentures governing our homebuilding senior notes contain a “savings clause” which limits the liability of each guarantor on its guarantee to the maximum amount that such guarantor can incur without risk that its guarantee will be subject to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer this provision may not be effective to protect such guarantees from fraudulent transfer challenges or if it does it may reduce such guarantor’s obligation such that the remaining amount due and collectible under the guarantees would not suffice if necessary to pay the notes in full when due 

the following tables present summarized financial information for dr horton inc and the guarantor subsidiaries on a combined basis after intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated among dr horton inc and the guarantor subsidiaries as well as their investment in and equity in earnings from the nonguarantor subsidiaries 



seasonality 

although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again in the future we generally close more homes and generate greater revenues and pretax income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year the seasonal nature of our business can also cause significant variations in the working capital requirements for our homebuilding lot development financial services and rental operations as a result of seasonal activity our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year

critical accounting policies and estimates 

general  — a comprehensive enumeration of the significant accounting policies of dr horton inc and subsidiaries is presented in note a to the accompanying financial statements as of september 30 2022 and 2021 and for the years ended september 30 2022 2021 and 2020 each of our accounting policies has been chosen based upon current authoritative literature that collectively comprises us generally accepted accounting principles gaap in instances where alternative methods of accounting are permissible under gaap we have chosen the method that most appropriately reflects the nature of our business the results of our operations and our financial condition and have consistently applied those methods over each of the periods presented in the financial statements the audit committee of our board of directors has reviewed and approved the accounting policies selected 

we believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition  — we generally recognize homebuilding revenue and related profit at the time of the closing of a sale when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer our performance obligation to deliver the agreedupon home is generally satisfied in less than one year from the original contract date proceeds from home closings held for our benefit at title companies are included in homebuilding cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets 

when we execute sales contracts with our homebuyers or when we require advance payment from homebuyers for custom changes upgrades or options related to their homes we record the cash deposits received as liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are cancelled we either retain or refund to the homebuyer deposits on cancelled sales contracts depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances 

forestar’s land and lot sales revenue and related profit are generally recognized at the time of the closing of a sale when title to and possession of the property are transferred to a thirdparty buyer forestar’s revenues from land and lot sales to dr horton are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 

we rarely purchase unimproved land for resale but periodically may elect to sell parcels of land that do not fit into our strategic operating plans revenue from land sales is typically recognized on the closing date which is generally when performance obligations are satisfied 

we recognize financial services revenues associated with our title operations as closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued both of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed revenues associated with our mortgage operations primarily include net gains on the sale of mortgage loans and servicing rights we typically elect the fair value option for our mortgage loan originations whereby mortgage loans held for sale are recorded at fair value based on either sale commitments or current market quotes and loan values are adjusted through revenues for subsequent changes in fair value until the loans are sold expected gains and losses from the sale of servicing rights are included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through revenues at the time of commitment we sell substantially all of the mortgages we originate and the related servicing rights to thirdparty purchasers interest income is earned from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold 

mortgage loans are sold with limited recourse provisions which can result in repurchases of loans previously sold to investors or payments to reimburse investors for loan losses based on historical experience analysis of the volume of mortgages we originated discussions with our mortgage purchasers and current housing and credit market conditions we estimate and record a loss reserve for mortgage loans held in portfolio and mortgage loans held for sale as well as known and projected mortgage loan repurchase requests 

inventories and cost of sales  — inventory includes the costs of direct land acquisition land development and construction capitalized interest real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and construction costs that we incur after projects or homes are substantially complete such as utilities maintenance and cleaning are charged to sga expense as incurred all indirect overhead costs such as compensation of sales personnel division and region management and the costs of advertising and builder’s risk insurance are charged to sga expense as incurred 

land and development costs are typically allocated to individual residential lots on a prorata basis and the costs of residential lots are transferred to construction in progress when home construction begins home construction costs are specifically identified and recorded to individual homes cost of sales for homes closed includes the specific construction costs of each home and all applicable land acquisition land development and related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred allocated to each residential lot based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each community cost of sales for lots sold includes all applicable land acquisition land development and related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred allocated to each residential lot in the community any changes to the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial home or lot closings in a community are generally allocated on a prorata basis to the remaining homes or lots in the community associated with the relevant development activity 

when a home is closed we generally have not paid all incurred costs necessary to complete the home we record a liability and a corresponding charge to cost of sales for the amount estimated to ultimately be paid related to completed homes that have been closed we compare our home construction budgets to actual recorded costs to determine the additional costs remaining to be paid on each closed home we monitor the accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on closed homes in subsequent months to the amounts previously accrued although actual costs to be paid in the future on previously closed homes could differ from our current accruals such differences have not been significant 

at the end of each quarter we review the performance and outlook for all of our communities and land inventories for indicators of potential impairment we generally review our inventory for impairment indicators at the community level and the inventory within each community is categorized as land held for development residential land and lots developed and under development land held for sale rental properties and construction in progress and finished homes based on the stage of production or plans for future development or sale a particular community often includes inventory in more than one category in certain situations inventory may be analyzed separately for impairment purposes based on its product type or future plans in reviewing each of our communities we determine if impairment indicators exist on inventory held and used by analyzing a variety of factors including but not limited to the following 

• gross margins on homes closed in recent months 

• projected gross margins on homes sold but not closed 

• projected gross margins based on community budgets 

• projected gross margins of rental property sales 

• trends in gross margins average selling prices or cost of sales 

• sales absorption rates and 

• performance of other communities in nearby locations 

if indicators of impairment are present for a community we perform an impairment evaluation of the community which includes an analysis to determine if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts if so impairment charges are recorded to cost of sales if the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying amounts these estimates of cash flows are significantly impacted by community specific factors including estimates of the amounts and timing of future revenues and estimates of the amount of land development materials and labor costs which in turn may be impacted by the following local market conditions 

• supply and availability of new and existing homes 

• location and desirability of our communities 

• variety of product types offered in the area 

• pricing and use of incentives by us and our competitors 

• alternative uses for our land or communities such as the sale of land finished lots or home sites to third parties 

• amount of land and lots we own or control in a particular market or submarket and 

• local economic and demographic trends 

for those assets deemed to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets our determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams when an impairment charge for a community is determined the charge is then allocated to each lot in the community in the same manner as land and development costs are allocated to each lot impairment charges are also recorded on finished homes in substantially completed communities and completed rental properties when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values are greater than the fair values less estimated costs to sell these homes 

we rarely purchase land for resale however when we own land or communities under development that do not fit into our development and construction plans and we determine that we will sell the asset the project is accounted for as land held for sale if certain criteria are met we record land held for sale at the lesser of its carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell in performing the impairment evaluation for land held for sale we consider several factors including but not limited to recent offers received to purchase the property prices for land in recent comparable sales transactions and market analysis studies which include the estimated price a willing buyer would pay for the land if the estimated fair value less costs to sell an asset is less than the current carrying value the asset is written down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell 

the key assumptions relating to inventory valuations are impacted by local market and economic conditions and are inherently uncertain although our quarterly assessments reflect management’s best estimates due to uncertainties in the estimation process actual results could differ from such estimates 

warranty claims  — we typically provide our homebuyers with a tenyear limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems a twoyear limited warranty on major mechanical systems and a oneyear limited warranty on other construction components since we subcontract our construction work to subcontractors who typically provide us with an indemnity and a certificate of insurance prior to receiving payments for their work claims relating to workmanship and materials are generally the primary responsibility of the subcontractors warranty liabilities have been established by charging cost of sales for each home delivered the amounts charged are based on management’s estimate of expected warrantyrelated costs under all unexpired warranty obligation periods our warranty liability is based upon historical warranty cost experience in each market in which we operate and is adjusted to reflect qualitative risks associated with the types of homes we build and the geographic areas in which we build them actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts a 10 change in the historical warranty rates used to estimate our warranty accrual would not result in a material change in our accrual for additional information regarding our warranty liability see note l “commitments and contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

legal claims and insurance  — we are named as a defendant in various claims complaints and other legal actions in the ordinary course of business at any point in time we are managing several hundred individual claims related to construction defect matters personal injury claims employment matters land development issues contract disputes and other matters we have established reserves for these contingencies based on the estimated costs of pending claims and the estimated costs of anticipated future claims related to previously closed homes approximately 99 of these reserves related to construction defect matters at both september 30 2022 and 2021 

our reserves for construction defect claims include the estimated costs of both known claims and anticipated future claims at september 30 2022 and 2021 we had reserves for approximately 560 and 380 pending construction defect claims respectively and no individual existing claim was material to our financial statements during fiscal 2022 we were notified of approximately 355 new construction defect claims and resolved 175 construction defect claims for a total cost of 244 million we have closed a significant number of homes during recent years and we may be subject to future construction defect claims on these homes although regulations vary from state to state construction defect issues can generally be reported for up to ten years after the home has closed in many states in which we operate historical data and trends regarding the frequency of claims incurred and the costs to resolve claims relative to the types of products and markets where we operate are used to estimate the construction defect liabilities for both existing and anticipated future claims these estimates are subject to ongoing revision as the circumstances of individual pending claims and historical data and trends change adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the accounting period in which the change in estimate occurs 

historical trends in construction defect claims have been inconsistent and we believe they may continue to fluctuate we also believe that fluctuations in housing market conditions can affect the frequency and cost of construction defect claims if the ultimate resolution of construction defect claims resulting from our home closings in prior years varies from current expectations it could significantly change our estimates regarding the frequency and timing of claims incurred and the costs to resolve existing and anticipated future claims which would impact the construction defect reserves in the future if the frequency of claims incurred or costs of existing and future legal claims significantly exceed our current estimates they will have a significant negative impact on our future earnings and liquidity 

we estimate and record receivables under the applicable insurance policies related to our estimated contingencies for known claims and anticipated future construction defect claims on previously closed homes and other legal claims and lawsuits incurred in the ordinary course of business when recovery is probable however because the selfinsured retentions under these policies are significant we anticipate we will largely be selfinsured additionally we may have the ability to recover a portion of our losses from our subcontractors and their insurance carriers when we have been named as an additional insured on their insurance policies 

the estimation of losses related to these reserves and the related estimates of recoveries from insurance policies are subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends in construction defect claims relative to our markets and the types of products built claim frequency claim settlement costs and patterns insurance industry practices and legal interpretations among others due to the high degree of judgment required in establishing reserves for these contingencies actual future costs and recoveries from insurance could differ significantly from current estimated amounts a 10 increase in the claim frequency and the average cost per claim used to estimate the reserves would result in an increase of approximately 1338 million in our reserves and a 469 million increase in our insurance receivable resulting in additional expense of 869 million a 10 decrease in the claim frequency and the average cost per claim would result in a decrease of approximately 1204 million in our reserves and a 495 million decrease in our insurance receivable resulting in a reduction in expense of 709 million for additional information regarding our legal claims reserves see note l “commitments and contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

pending accounting standards 

in march 2020 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu 202004 “reference rate reform” which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying us gaap to contracts hedging relationships and other transactions affected by the discontinuation of the london interbank offered rate libor or by another reference rate expected to be discontinued the guidance was effective beginning march 12 2020 and can be applied prospectively through december 31 2022 in january 2021 the fasb issued asu 202101 “reference rate reform  scope” which clarified the scope and application of the original guidance we will adopt these standards when libor is discontinued and do not expect them to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures 

in october 2021 the fasb issued asu 202108 which requires application of asc 606 “revenue from contracts with customers” to recognize and measure contract assets and liabilities from contracts with customers acquired in a business combination asu 202108 creates an exception to the general recognition and measurement principle in asc 805 and will result in recognition of contract assets and contract liabilities consistent with those recorded by the acquiree immediately before the acquisition date the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2023 with early adoption permitted we are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance and it is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are subject to interest rate risk on our longterm debt we monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and utilize both fixed and variable rate debt for fixed rate debt changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows conversely for variable rate debt changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument but may affect our future earnings and cash flows except in very limited circumstances we do not have an obligation to prepay fixedrate debt prior to maturity and as a result interest rate risk and changes in fair value would not have a significant impact on our cash flows related to our fixedrate debt until such time as we are required to refinance repurchase or repay such debt 

we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with our mortgage loan origination services we manage interest rate risk through the use of forward sales of mbs which are referred to as “hedging instruments” in the following discussion we do not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate lock commitments irlcs are extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and who meet defined credit and underwriting criteria typically the irlcs have a duration of less than six months some irlcs are committed immediately to a specific purchaser through the use of bestefforts whole loan delivery commitments while other irlcs are funded prior to being committed to thirdparty purchasers the hedging instruments related to irlcs are classified and accounted for as derivative instruments in an economic hedge with gains and losses recognized in revenues in the consolidated statements of operations hedging instruments related to funded uncommitted loans are accounted for at fair value with changes recognized in revenues in the consolidated statements of operations along with changes in the fair value of the funded uncommitted loans the fair value change related to the hedging instruments generally offsets the fair value change in the uncommitted loans the net fair value change which for the years ended september 30 2022 and 2021 was not significant is recognized in current earnings at september 30 2022 hedging instruments used to mitigate interest rate risk related to uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale and uncommitted irlcs totaled a notional amount of 54 billion uncommitted irlcs totaled a notional amount of approximately 40 billion and uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale totaled a notional amount of approximately 16 billion at september 30 2022 

we also use hedging instruments as part of a program to offer below market interest rate financing to our homebuyers at september 30 2022 and 2021 we had mbs totaling 5324 million and 8346 million respectively that did not yet have irlcs or closed loans created or assigned and recorded an asset of 48 million and 11 million respectively for the fair value of such mbs position 

the following table sets forth principal cash flows by scheduled maturity effective weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value of our debt obligations as of september 30 2022 because the mortgage repurchase facility is effectively secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale that are typically sold within 60 days its outstanding balance is included in the most current period presented the interest rate for our variable rate debt represents the weighted average interest rate in effect at september 30 2022

following is an overview of our company’s operating structure and the significant processes that support our business controls strategies and performance 

homebuilding markets 

our homebuilding business operates in 98 markets across 31 states which provides us with geographic diversification in our homebuilding inventory investments and our sources of revenues and earnings we believe our geographic diversification lowers our operational risks by mitigating the effects of local and regional economic cycles and it also enhances our earnings potential by providing more diverse opportunities to invest in our business 

we conduct our homebuilding operations in the geographic regions states and markets listed below and we conduct our financial services operations in many of these markets our homebuilding operating divisions are aggregated into six reporting segments also referred to as reporting regions which comprise the markets below during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 we reassessed our operating segments and reportable segments and realigned the aggregation of our homebuilding operating segments into six new reportable segments to better allocate our homebuilding operating segments across geographic reporting regions our financial statements and the notes thereto contain additional information regarding segment performance 



when evaluating new or existing homebuilding markets for purposes of capital allocation we consider local marketspecific factors including among others 

• economic conditions 

• employment levels and job growth 

• income level of potential homebuyers 

• local housing affordability and typical mortgage products utilized 

• market for homes at our targeted price points 

• availability of land and lots in desirable locations on acceptable terms 

• land entitlement and development processes 

• availability of qualified subcontractors 

• new and secondary home sales activity 

• competition 

• prevailing housing products features cost and pricing and 

• performance capabilities of our local management team 

economies of scale 

we are the largest homebuilding company in the united states in fiscal 2021 as measured by number of homes closed and we are also one of the largest builders in most of the markets in which we operate we believe that our national regional and local scale of operations provides us with benefits that may not be available to the same degree to some other smaller homebuilders such as 

• greater access to and lower cost of capital due to our balance sheet strength and our lending and capital markets relationships 

• volume discounts and rebates from national regional and local materials suppliers and lower labor rates from certain subcontractors and 

• enhanced leverage of our general and administrative activities which allows us flexibility to adjust to changes in market conditions and compete effectively across our markets 

decentralized homebuilding operations 

we view homebuilding as a local business therefore most of our direct homebuilding activities are decentralized to provide flexibility to our local managers in making operational decisions we believe that our local management teams who are familiar with local market conditions have the best information to make many decisions regarding their operations at september 30 2021 we had 56 separate homebuilding operating divisions many of which operate in more than one market area generally each operating division consists of a division president a controller and accounting personnel land entitlement acquisition and development personnel a sales manager and sales and marketing personnel a construction manager and construction superintendents customer service personnel a purchasing manager and office staff our division presidents receive performancebased compensation if they achieve targeted financial and operating metrics related to their operating divisions following is a summary of our homebuilding activities that are decentralized in our local operating divisions and the control and oversight functions that are centralized in our regional and corporate offices

landlot acquisition and inventory management 

we acquire land for use in our operations after we have completed due diligence and generally after we have obtained the rights known as entitlements to begin development or construction work resulting in an acceptable number of residential lots before we acquire lots or tracts of land we complete a feasibility study which includes soil tests independent environmental studies other engineering work and financial analysis we also evaluate the status of necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements required to develop and use the property for home construction although we purchase and develop land primarily to support our homebuilding activities we may sell land and lots to other developers and homebuilders where we have excess land and lot positions or for other strategic reasons 

we also enter into landlot contracts in which we obtain the right but generally not the obligation to buy land or lots at predetermined prices on a defined schedule commensurate with anticipated home closings or planned development these contracts generally are nonrecourse which limits our financial exposure to our earnest money deposited into escrow under the terms of the contract and any preacquisition due diligence costs we incur this enables us to control land and lot positions with limited capital investment which substantially reduces the risks associated with land ownership 

we directly acquire almost all of our land and lot positions we are a party to a small number of joint ventures joint ventures are consolidated if we have a controlling interest or accounted for under the equity method of accounting if we have a significant influence but not control 

we attempt to mitigate our exposure to real estate inventory risks by 

• controlling our level of inventory investment and managing our supply of landlots owned and controlled through purchase contracts to match the expected housing demand in each of our operating markets 

• monitoring local market and demographic trends housing preferences and related economic developments including the identification of desirable housing submarkets based on the quality of local schools new job opportunities local growth initiatives and personal income trends 

• utilizing landlot purchase contracts and seeking to acquire developed lots which are substantially ready for home construction where possible and 

• monitoring and managing the number of speculative homes homes under construction without an executed sales contract built in each subdivision 

land development and home construction 

substantially all of our land development and home construction work is performed by subcontractors subcontractors typically are selected after a competitive bidding process and are retained for a specific subdivision or series of house plans pursuant to a contract that obligates the subcontractor to complete the scope of work at an agreedupon price we employ land development managers and construction superintendents to monitor land development and home construction activities participate in major design and building decisions coordinate the activities of subcontractors and suppliers review the work of subcontractors for quality and cost controls and monitor compliance with zoning and building codes in addition our construction superintendents interact with our homebuyers during the construction process and instruct buyers on postclosing home maintenance 

our home designs are selected or prepared in each of our markets to appeal to local homebuyers’ expectations for affordability home size and features and our local management teams adjust product offerings to meet buyer demand as necessary in many communities we offer optional interior and exterior features to homebuyers for an additional charge construction time for our homes depends on the availability of labor materials and supplies the weather the size of the home and other factors we completed the construction of most homes within two to seven months in fiscal 2021 which is longer than prior years as construction times have been impacted by the labor and materials shortages discussed below 

we typically do not maintain significant inventories of land development or construction materials except for work in progress materials for active development projects and homes under construction generally the construction materials used in our operations have been readily available from numerous sources and we have contracts exceeding one year with certain suppliers of building materials that are cancelable at our option in fiscal 2021 the effects of the covid19 pandemic and labor shortages on manufacturing production combined with the improvement in economic conditions and the strong demand for new homes caused multiple disruptions in our supply chain and have resulted in shortages in certain building materials and tightness in the construction labor market which has caused our construction cycle to lengthen 

we are subject to governmental regulations that affect our land development and construction operations at times we have experienced delays in receiving the proper approvals from municipalities or other government agencies that have delayed our anticipated development and construction activities in certain communities 

cost controls 

we control construction costs by designing our homes efficiently and by obtaining competitive bids for construction materials and labor we also competitively bid and negotiate pricing from our subcontractors and suppliers based on the volume of services and products we purchase on a local regional and national basis we monitor our land development expenditures and construction costs versus budgets for each house and community and we review our inventory levels margins expenses profitability and returns for each operating market compared to both its business plan and our performance expectations 

we control overhead costs by centralizing certain accounting and administrative functions monitoring staffing and compensation levels and by applying technology to business processes to improve productivity where practical we review other general and administrative costs to identify efficiencies and savings opportunities in our operating divisions and our regional and corporate offices we also direct many of our promotional activities toward local real estate brokers and digital marketing initiatives which we believe are efficient uses of our marketing expenditures 

marketing and sales 

we primarily use the dr horton emerald homes express homes and freedom homes brand names to market and sell our homes our dr horton branded communities are the core of our business and account for the majority of our home closings focusing primarily on the first time and first time moveup homebuyer our emerald branded communities appeal to buyers in search of higherend moveup and luxury homes our express branded communities primarily accommodate a segment of entrylevel buyers who are focused on affordability our freedom homes brand offers homes at affordable price points to active adult buyers seeking a lowmaintenance lifestyle the percentage of home closings and home sales revenue contributed by each brand during fiscal 2021 was as follows 



we also use names of acquired companies for a period of time after the acquisition we currently utilize the pacific ridge homes brand in our seattle washington market and the terramor homes brand in our raleigh north carolina market the product offerings in all of these markets are similar to and included with our dr horton branded communities shown above 

we market and sell our homes primarily through commissioned employees and the majority of our home closings also involve an independent real estate broker we typically conduct home sales from sales offices located in furnished model homes in each subdivision and we generally do not offer our model homes for sale until the completion of a subdivision our sales personnel assist prospective homebuyers by providing floor plans and price information demonstrating the features and layouts of our homes and assisting with the selection of options when available we train and inform our sales personnel regarding construction schedules and marketing and advertising plans as market conditions warrant we may provide potential homebuyers with incentives such as discounts or included upgrades to be competitive in a particular market or to attain our targeted sales pace 

we market our homes and communities to prospective homebuyers and real estate brokers digitally through email search engine marketing social media and our company website and other real estate websites in addition to print media and advertisement we also use billboards radio television magazine and newspaper advertising locally as necessary we attempt to position our subdivisions in locations that are desirable to potential homebuyers and convenient to or visible from local traffic patterns which helps to reduce advertising costs model homes play an important role in our marketing efforts and we expend significant effort and resources to create an attractive atmosphere in our model homes 

we also build speculative homes in most of our communities which allow us to compete effectively with existing homes available in the market and improve our profits and returns these homes enhance our marketing and sales efforts to prospective homebuyers who are renters or who are relocating to these markets and require a home within a short time frame as well as to independent brokers who represent these homebuyers we determine our speculative homes strategy in each market based on local market factors such as new job growth the number of job relocations housing demand and supply seasonality current sales contract cancellation trends and our past experience in the market we attempt to maintain a level of speculative home inventory in each community based on our current and planned sales pace and we monitor and adjust speculative home inventory on an ongoing basis as conditions warrant 

sales contracts and backlog 

our sales contracts require an earnest money deposit which varies in amount across our markets and communities additionally customers are generally required to pay additional deposits when they select options or upgrade features for their homes our sales contracts include a financing contingency which permits customers to cancel and receive a refund of their deposit if they cannot obtain mortgage financing at prevailing or specified interest rates within a defined period our contracts may include other contingencies such as the sale of an existing home we either retain or refund customer deposits on cancelled sales contracts depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances 

sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period at september 30 2021 the value of our backlog of sales orders was 95 billion 26221 homes an increase of 16 from 82 billion 26683 homes at september 30 2020 the average sales price of homes in backlog was 360900 at september 30 2021 up from the 306800 average at september 30 2020 many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies such as those described above which can result in cancellations as a percentage of gross sales orders cancellations of sales contracts were 17 in fiscal 2021 compared to 20 in fiscal 2020 

the length of time between the signing of a sales contract for a home and delivery of the home to the buyer closing is generally from one to seven months therefore substantially all of the homes in our sales backlog at september 30 2021 are scheduled to close in fiscal 2022 

customer service and quality control 

our operating divisions are responsible for preclosing quality control inspections and responding to customers’ postclosing needs we believe that a prompt and courteous response to homebuyers’ needs during and after construction reduces postclosing repair costs enhances our reputation for quality and service and ultimately leads to repeat and referral business from the real estate community and homebuyers we typically provide our homebuyers with a tenyear limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems a twoyear limited warranty on major mechanical systems and a oneyear limited warranty on other construction components the subcontractors who perform the actual construction also provide us with warranties on workmanship and are expected to respond to us and the homeowner in a timely manner in addition some of our suppliers provide manufacturer’s warranties on specified products installed in the home 

rental properties 

our multifamily rental operations develop construct lease own and ultimately sell multifamily residential properties that produce rental income we primarily focus on constructing garden style multifamily rental communities which typically accommodate 200 to 400 dwelling units in high growth suburban markets we sold three multifamily rental properties in fiscal 2021 and two multifamily rental properties in fiscal 2020 

during fiscal 2020 we began constructing and leasing singlefamily homes as incomeproducing rental communities our singlefamily rental operations construct singlefamily rental homes with the intent to later market the community for a bulk sale of homes we completed three bulk sales of singlefamily rental properties in fiscal 2021 and no bulk sales of these properties in fiscal 2020 

forestar residential lot development operations 

during fiscal 2018 we acquired 75 of the outstanding shares of forestar forestar is a residential lot development company with operations in 56 markets across 23 states as of september 30 2021 we owned approximately 63 of forestar’s outstanding common stock at september 30 2021 forestar is a component of our homebuilding strategy to enhance operational efficiency and returns by expanding relationships with land developers and increasing the portion of our land and lot position controlled through land purchase contracts forestar’s strategy is focused on making investments in land acquisition and development to expand its residential lot development business across a geographically diversified national platform and consolidating market share in the fragmented us lot development industry our homebuilding operations acquire finished lots from forestar in accordance with the master supply agreement between the two companies a shared services agreement is in place whereby we provide forestar certain administrative compliance operational and procurement services as the controlling shareholder we have significant influence in guiding the strategic direction and operations of forestar 

customer mortgage financing 

we provide mortgage financing services principally to purchasers of our homes in the majority of our homebuilding markets through dhi mortgage our 100 owned subsidiary dhi mortgage assists in the sales transaction by coordinating the mortgage application mortgage commitment and home closing processes to facilitate a timely and efficient homebuying experience for our buyers during the year ended september 30 2021 dhi mortgage provided mortgage financing services for approximately 67 of our total homes closed and approximately 98 of dhi mortgage’s loan volume related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations most of our homebuilding divisions also work with additional mortgage lenders that offer a range of mortgage financing programs to our homebuyers 

to limit the risks associated with our mortgage operations dhi mortgage originates loan products that we believe can be sold to thirdparty purchasers of mortgage loans the majority of which are eligible for sale to the federal national mortgage association fannie mae the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac or the government national mortgage association ginnie mae dhi mortgage sells substantially all of the loans and the related servicing rights to thirdparty purchasers after origination with limited recourse provisions dhi mortgage centralizes most of its control and oversight functions including those related to loan underwriting quality control regulatory compliance secondary marketing of loans hedging activities accounting and financial reporting 

title services 

through our subsidiary title companies we serve as a title insurance agent in selected markets by providing title insurance policies examination and closing services primarily to our homebuilding customers 

human capital resources 

people and culture 

for the past two fiscal years despite the covid19 pandemic we increased the number of employees in all of our operating segments and made no reductions to our employee compensation plans or employee benefit plans as of september 30 2021 we employed 11788 people of whom 7947 work in our homebuilding operations 2891 in our financial services segment 482 at our corporate office 250 for our forestar subsidiary 175 in our rental operations and 43 in our other businesses of our homebuilding employees 3369 are involved in construction 2018 are sales and marketing personnel and 2560 are office personnel 

we believe the people who work for our company are our most important resources and are critical to our continued success we focus significant attention toward attracting and retaining talented and experienced individuals to manage and support our operations our people are expected to exhibit and promote honest ethical and respectful conduct in the workplace all of our employees must adhere to a code of conduct that sets standards for appropriate behavior and includes required internal training on preventing identifying reporting and stopping any type of discrimination 

recruitment development and retention 

we are committed to hiring developing and supporting a diverse workforce and maintaining an inclusive workplace we believe diversity in the workplace produces unique perspectives and fresh ideas and helps us better serve our customers our management team also supports a culture of developing future leaders from our existing workforce enabling us to promote from within for many leadership positions we believe this provides longterm focus and continuity to our operations while also providing opportunities for the growth and advancement of our employees additionally the longterm retention of our employees provides us with an experienced cohesive workforce which has been vital to achieving our goals our focus on retention is evident in the length of service of our executive regional and divisional management teams the average tenure of our executive team and homebuilding region presidents is 28 years our homebuilding division presidents is 15 years and our city managers is greater than 10 years 

compensation and benefits 

we believe our compensation package and benefits are competitive with others in our industry in addition to base pay eligible employees may participate in our shortterm incentive bonus program andor our stock compensation plan we also offer our employees a broad range of benefits including medical dental and vision healthcare insurance and paid parental leave additional information about our compensation and employee benefit plans such as our 401k savings plan employee stock purchase plan and our stock compensation plans is included in note k to the accompanying financial statements 

workplace safety and wellness 

the safety and wellbeing of our employees is our first priority we take workplace safety seriously at our construction sites and in our offices we provide thirdparty training for our field personnel to become certified by the occupational safety and health administration osha and we communicate with all of our employees through a monthly safety newsletter to inform and reinforce our commitment to and concern for their well being 

we implemented safety protocols to protect our employees and our homebuyers during the covid19 pandemic these protocols include complying with health and safety standards as required by federal state and local government agencies taking into consideration guidelines of the centers for disease control and prevention and other public health authorities many of our administrative and operational functions during this time required modification including some of our workforce working remotely our experienced teams of people adapted to the changes in our work environment and have managed our business successfully during this challenging time 

business acquisitions 

we routinely evaluate opportunities to profitably expand our operations including potential acquisitions of other homebuilding or related businesses acquisitions of homebuilding and related businesses usually provide us with immediate land and home inventories and control of additional land and lot positions through purchase contracts also employees of acquired businesses generally have specialized knowledge of local market conditions including existing relationships with municipalities land owners developers subcontractors and suppliers these inventory positions and local market knowledge and relationships could take us several years to develop through our own efforts we seek to limit the risks associated with acquiring other companies by conducting extensive operational financial and legal due diligence on each acquisition and by performing financial analysis to determine that each acquisition is expected to have a positive impact on our earnings within an acceptable period of time 

competition 

the homebuilding lot development and rental housing industries are highly competitive we compete not only for homebuyers and renters but also for desirable properties raw materials skilled labor and financing we compete with local regional and national companies in these industries and also with existing home sales foreclosures and rental properties we compete on the basis of price location quality and design of our homes and on mortgage financing terms 

the competitors to our financial services businesses include other mortgage lenders and title companies including national regional and local mortgage banks and other financial institutions some of these competitors are subject to fewer governmental regulations and have greater access to capital than we do may operate with different lending criteria andor may offer a broader or more attractive array of financing and other products and services to potential customers we strive to provide flexible fairly priced financing alternatives subject to applicable regulations 

our businesses compete with other companies across all industries to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced employees managers and executives competition for the services of these individuals increases as business conditions improve in the homebuilding lot development financial services and rental housing industries and in the general economy 

governmental regulations and environmental matters 

the homebuilding lot development and rental housing industries are subject to extensive and complex regulations we and the subcontractors we use must comply with many federal state and local laws and regulations these include zoning density and development requirements and building environmental advertising labor and real estate sales rules and regulations these regulations and requirements affect substantially all aspects of our land development and home design construction and sales processes in varying degrees across our markets our homes are inspected by local authorities where required and homes eligible for insurance or guarantees provided by the federal housing administration fha and the us department of veteran affairs va are subject to inspection by them these regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities in addition our new housing developments may be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets utilities and other public improvements 

our construction and land development activities are also subject to an extensive array of local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning protection of health safety and the environment the particular compliance requirements for each site vary greatly according to location environmental condition and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with existing environmental regulations applicable to our business additionally our compliance with such regulations has not had nor is expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows however changes in regulations could increase our costs to comply with such regulations as discussed in “item 1a risk factors” 

our mortgage company must comply with extensive state and federal laws and regulations which are administered by numerous agencies including the consumer financial protection bureau federal housing finance agency us department of housing and urban development fha va united states department of agriculture usda fannie mae freddie mac and ginnie mae these laws and regulations include many compliance requirements including licensing consumer disclosures fair lending and real estate settlement procedures as a result our operations are subject to regular extensive examinations by the applicable agencies 

seasonality 

although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again in the future we generally close more homes and generate greater revenues and pretax income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year the seasonal nature of our business can also cause significant variations in the working capital requirements for our homebuilding lot development financial services and rental operations as a result of seasonal activity our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year 




 item 1a risk factors 

discussion of our business and operations included in this annual report on form 10k should be read together with the risk factors set forth below they describe various risks and uncertainties we are or may become subject to many of which are difficult to predict or beyond our control these risks and uncertainties together with other factors described elsewhere in this report have the potential to affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner 

risks related to our business and our industry 

the homebuilding lot development and rental housing industries are cyclical and affected by changes in economic real estate or other conditions that could adversely affect our business or financial results 

the homebuilding lot development and rental housing industries are cyclical and are significantly affected by changes in general and local economic and real estate conditions such as 

• employment levels 

• consumer confidence and spending 

• housing demand 

• availability of financing for homebuyers 

• availability of financing for companies that purchase our rental properties 

• interest rates 

• availability and prices of new homes and existing homes for sale and availability and market values of rental properties and 

• demographic trends 

adverse changes in these general and local economic conditions or deterioration in the broader economy would cause a negative impact on our business and financial results and increase the risk for asset impairments and writeoffs changes in these economic conditions may affect some of our regions or markets more than others if adverse conditions affect our larger markets they could have a proportionately greater impact on us than on some other companies 

in the past the federal government’s fiscal and trade policies and economic stimulus actions have created uncertainty in the financial markets and caused volatility in interest rates which impacted business and consumer behavior monetary policy actions affecting interest rates or fiscal policy actions and new legislation related to taxation spending levels or borrowing limits along with the related political debates conflicts and compromises associated with such actions may negatively impact the financial markets and consumer confidence such events could hurt the us economy and the housing and rental markets and in turn could adversely affect the operating results of our businesses 

deployments of us military personnel to foreign regions terrorist attacks other acts of violence or threats to national security and any corresponding response by the united states or others domestic or international instability or social or political unrest may cause an economic slowdown in the markets where we operate which could adversely affect our business 

if we experience any of the foregoing potential customers may be less willing or able to buy our homes or our rental properties in the future our pricing and product strategies may also be limited by market conditions we may be unable to change the mix of our home or rental offerings reduce the costs of the homes or properties we build offer more affordable homes or rental properties or satisfactorily address changing market conditions in other ways without adversely affecting our profits and returns in addition cancellations of home sales contracts in backlog may increase if homebuyers do not honor their contracts due to any of the factors discussed above 

our financial services business is closely related to our homebuilding business as it originates mortgage loans principally to purchasers of the homes we build a decrease in the demand for our homes because of the foregoing matters will also adversely affect the financial results of this segment of our business an increase in the default rate on the mortgages we originate may adversely affect our ability to sell the mortgages or the pricing we receive upon the sale of mortgages or may increase our recourse obligations for previous originations we may be responsible for losses 

associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to thirdparty purchasers in the event of errors or omissions relating to certain representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the type of collateral the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in the connection with the loan and we may be required to repurchase certain of those mortgage loans or provide indemnification repurchased mortgage loans andor the settlement of claims associated with such loans could adversely affect our business or financial results we establish reserves for estimated losses and future repurchase obligations for mortgage loans we have sold however actual future obligations related to these mortgages could differ significantly from our current estimated amounts additionally in fiscal 2020 we began retaining mortgage servicing rights on some of our originations as servicer for these loans we may incur losses by having to advance payments to the mortgagebacked securities mbs bondholders to the extent there are insufficient collections to satisfy the required principal and interest remittances of the underlying mbs 

constriction of the credit and public capital markets could limit our ability to access capital and increase our costs of capital 

during past economic and housing downturns the credit markets constricted and reduced some sources of liquidity that were previously available to us consequently we relied principally on our cash on hand to meet our working capital needs and repay outstanding indebtedness during those times there likely will be periods in the future when financial market upheaval will increase our cost of capital or limit our ability to access the public debt markets or obtain bank financing 

our homebuilding operations utilize a 219 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to 30 billion subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments our homebuilding revolving credit facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit equal to 100 of the revolving credit commitment the maturity date of the facility is april 20 2026 forestar and its subsidiaries our financial services and rental subsidiaries and certain of our other subsidiaries are not guarantors under our homebuilding revolving credit facility or our homebuilding senior notes 

forestar has a 410 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to 600 million subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments the forestar revolving credit facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit equal to the greater of 100 million and 50 of the revolving credit commitment the maturity date of the facility is april 16 2025 the forestar revolving credit facility is guaranteed by forestar’s whollyowned subsidiaries that are not immaterial subsidiaries or have not been designated as unrestricted subsidiaries the forestar revolving credit facility is not guaranteed by us or our other subsidiaries 

our mortgage subsidiary utilizes a 14 billion mortgage repurchase facility to finance the majority of the loans it originates the capacity of the facility automatically increases during certain higher volume periods and can be further increased through additional commitments the total capacity of the facility at september 30 2021 was 18 billion and its maturity date is february 18 2022 adverse changes in market conditions could make the renewal of these facilities more difficult or could result in an increase in the cost of these facilities or a decrease in the committed amounts such changes affecting our mortgage repurchase facility may also make it more difficult or costly to sell the mortgages that we originate 

we regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund growth in our business repay debt obligations pay dividends repurchase our common stock and support other general corporate and operational needs and we regularly evaluate our opportunities to raise additional capital dr horton has an automatically effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec in july 2021 registering debt and equity securities that may be issued from time to time in amounts to be determined forestar also had an effective shelf registration statement filed with the sec in september 2018 registering 500 million of equity securities at september 30 2021 3599 million remained available for issuance under forestar’s shelf registration statement of which 656 million was reserved for sales under its atthemarket equity offering program in october 2021 after the expiration of forestar’s existing registration statement and atthemarket equity offering program a new shelf registration statement became effective registering 750 million of equity securities forestar anticipates entering into a new atthemarket equity offering program under this new shelf registration statement as market conditions permit we may issue new debt or equity securities through the capital markets or obtain additional bank financing to fund our projected capital requirements or provide additional liquidity we believe that our existing cash resources revolving credit facilities mortgage repurchase facility and ability to access the capital markets or obtain additional financing will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our nearterm working capital 

needs and debt obligations adverse changes in economic homebuilding or capital market conditions due to covid19 or otherwise could negatively affect our business liquidity and financial results restrict our ability to obtain additional capital or increase our costs of capital 

reductions in the availability of mortgage financing provided by government agencies changes in government financing programs a decrease in our ability to sell mortgage loans on attractive terms or an increase in mortgage interest rates could decrease our buyers’ ability to obtain financing and adversely affect our business or financial results 

the mortgage loans originated by our financial services operations are primarily eligible for sale to fannie mae freddie mac or ginnie mae and are typically sold to thirdparty purchasers the secondary market for mortgage loans continues to primarily desire securities backed by fannie mae freddie mac or ginnie mae and we believe the liquidity these agencies provide to the mortgage industry is important to the housing market any significant change regarding the longterm structure and viability of fannie mae and freddie mac could result in adjustments to the size of their loan portfolios and to guidelines for their loan products additionally a reduction in the availability of financing provided by these institutions could adversely affect interest rates mortgage availability and sales of new homes and mortgage loans during fiscal 2021 approximately 52 of our mortgage loans were sold directly to fannie mae or into securities backed by ginnie mae and 41 were sold to two other major financial entities on an ongoing basis we seek to establish loan purchase arrangements with additional financial entities if we are unable to sell mortgage loans to purchasers on attractive terms our ability to originate and sell mortgage loans at competitive prices could be limited which would negatively affect our profitability 

the fha insures mortgage loans that generally have lower credit requirements and is an important source for financing the sale of our homes changes restrictions or significant premium increases in fha programs in the future may negatively affect the availability or affordability of fha financing which could adversely affect our ability to sell homes 

some of our customers may qualify for 100 financing through programs offered by the va and the usda and certain other housing finance agencies these programs are subject to changes in regulations lending standards and government funding levels there can be no assurances that these programs or other programs will continue to be available in our homebuilding markets or that they will be as attractive to our customers as the programs currently offered which could negatively affect our sales 

mortgage rates are currently low compared to most historical periods however market conditions could change causing mortgage rates to rise in the future when interest rates increase the cost of owning a home increases which will likely reduce the number of potential homebuyers who can obtain mortgage financing and could result in a decline in the demand for our homes 

the risks associated with our land lot and rental inventory could adversely affect our business or financial results 

inventory risks are substantial for our homebuilding forestar and rental businesses there are risks inherent in controlling owning and developing land if housing demand declines we may not be able to build sell and rent homes profitably in some of our communities and we may not be able to fully recover the costs of some of the land and lots we own also the values of our owned undeveloped land lots and inventories may fluctuate significantly due to changes in market conditions as a result our deposits for lots controlled through purchase contracts may be put at risk we may have to sell or rent homes or land for a lower profit margin or record inventory impairment charges on our land and lots a significant deterioration in economic or homebuilding industry conditions may result in substantial inventory impairment charges 

we cannot make any assurances that our growth strategies acquisitions or investments will be successful or will not expose us to additional risks or other negative consequences 

in recent years we have primarily grown our business by increasing our investments in land lot and home inventories in our existing homebuilding markets we have also expanded through investments in new product offerings new geographic markets and the growth of our rental property operations investments in land lots home inventories and rental properties can expose us to risks of economic loss and asset impairments if housing conditions weaken or if we are unsuccessful in implementing our growth strategies 

in fiscal 2018 we acquired 75 of the outstanding shares of forestar and at september 30 2021 we owned 63 of its outstanding shares forestar is a publicly traded residential lot development company with operations in 56 markets across 23 states as of september 30 2021 forestar’s strategy is focused on making significant investments in land acquisition and development to expand its residential lot development business across a geographically diversified national platform and consolidating market share in the fragmented us lot development industry our homebuilding divisions acquire finished lots from forestar in accordance with the master supply agreement between the two companies and we provide forestar certain administrative compliance operational and procurement services through a shared services agreement as the controlling shareholder we strongly influence the strategic direction and operations of forestar 

in addition to the investment and merger with forestar we have acquired the homebuilding operations of several homebuilding companies in recent years and we may make strategic acquisitions of or investments in other companies operations or assets in the future such acquisitions and investments may have risks similar to those related to land lots and home inventories but they may also expose us to additional risks or other negative consequences these transactions may not advance our business strategy provide a satisfactory return on our investment or provide other benefits we anticipate also the integration of these transactions may not be successful and may require significant time and resources which may divert management’s attention from other operations acquisitions and investments could also expose us to material liabilities not discovered in the due diligence process and may lead to litigation if these transactions underperform our expectations or are unsuccessful we may incur significant expenses or writeoffs of inventory other assets or intangible assets such as goodwill acquisitions and investments can result in dilution to existing stockholders if we issue our common stock as consideration and can increase our debt levels or reduce our liquidity if we purchase them with cash the magnitude timing and nature of any future acquisitions or investments will depend on a number of factors including our ability to identify suitable additional markets or acquisition candidates the negotiation of acceptable terms our financial position and general economic and business conditions we also may seek to divest an investment or a business and may have difficulty selling such investment or business on acceptable terms in a timely manner 

our business and financial results could be adversely affected by significant inflation higher interest rates or deflation 

inflation can adversely affect us by increasing costs of land materials and labor in addition significant inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates which have a negative impact on housing affordability in a highly inflationary environment depending on industry and other economic conditions we may be precluded from raising home prices enough to keep up with the rate of inflation which could reduce our profit margins moreover in a highly inflationary environment our cost of capital labor and materials can increase and the purchasing power of our cash resources can decline which could have an adverse impact on our business or financial results 

alternatively a significant period of deflation could cause a decrease in overall spending and borrowing levels this could lead to deterioration in economic conditions including an increase in the rate of unemployment deflation could also cause the value of our inventories to decline or reduce the value of existing homes below the related mortgage loan balance which could potentially increase the supply of existing homes if oil prices decline significantly economic conditions in markets that have significant exposure to the energy sector may weaken these or other factors that increase the risk of significant deflation could have a negative impact on our business or financial results 

supply shortages and other risks related to acquiring land building materials and skilled labor could increase our costs and delay deliveries 

the homebuilding and lot development industries have from time to time experienced significant difficulties that can affect the cost or timing of construction including 

• difficulty in acquiring land suitable for residential building at affordable prices in locations where our potential customers want to live 

• shortages of qualified subcontractors 

• reliance on local subcontractors manufacturers distributors and land developers who may be inadequately capitalized 

• shortages of materials and 

• significant increases in the cost of materials particularly increases in the price of lumber drywall and cement which are significant components of home construction costs 

in addition tariffs duties andor trade restrictions imposed or increased on imported materials and goods that are used in connection with the construction and delivery of our homes including steel aluminum and lumber may raise our costs for these items or for the products made with them these factors may cause construction delays or cause us to incur more costs building our homes 

as restrictive orders relating to covid19 were eased and economic activity resumed demand for our homes increased significantly the effects of the pandemic combined with the improvement in economic conditions and the strong demand for new homes caused multiple disruptions in our supply chain and have resulted in shortages in certain building materials and tightness in the labor market which has caused our construction cycle to lengthen and costs of building materials to increase if shortages and cost increases in building materials and tightness in the labor market persist for a prolonged period of time our profit margins could be adversely impacted if we are unable to pass on future cost increases to our homebuyers by increasing the selling price of our homes 

public health issues such as a major epidemic or pandemic could adversely affect our business or financial results 

the us and other countries have experienced and may experience in the future outbreaks of contagious diseases that affect public health and public perception of health risk in december 2019 covid19 emerged in the wuhan region of china and subsequently spread worldwide the world health organization declared covid19 a pandemic resulting in federal state and local governments and private entities mandating various restrictions requiring closure of nonessential businesses for a period of time which began to adversely affect our business in march 2020 as economic activity resumed and restrictive orders relating to covid19 were eased demand for our homes improved significantly during the remainder of fiscal 2020 and remained strong throughout fiscal 2021 however the effects of the pandemic combined with the improvement in economic conditions and the strong demand for new homes caused multiple disruptions in our supply chain and have resulted in shortages in certain building materials and tightness in the labor market which has caused our construction cycle to lengthen 

there is uncertainty regarding the extent to which and how long covid19 will impact the us economy and our supply chain the extent to which covid19 impacts our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments including the duration and spread of covid19 or other variant strains and the impact on our customers trade partners and employees all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted if covid19 or other variant strains have a significant negative impact on economic conditions over a prolonged period of time our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted 

our business and financial results could be adversely affected by weather conditions and natural disasters 

physical risks including weather conditions and natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes volcanic activity droughts floods hailstorms heavy or prolonged precipitation wildfires and others can harm our business additionally the physical impacts of climate change may cause these occurrences to increase in frequency severity and duration any such events can delay our development work home construction and home closings unfavorably affect the cost or availability of materials or labor damage homes under construction lead to changing consumer preferences andor negatively impact demand for new homes in affected areas there has been no material impact on our business from these events or material operational challenges resulting from these events but they could adversely affect our business in the future the climates and geology of many of the states in which we operate including california florida texas and other coastal areas where we have some of our larger operations and which have experienced recent natural disasters present increased risks of adverse weather or natural disasters 

homebuilding is subject to home warranty and construction defect claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant 

we are subject to home warranty and construction defect claims arising in the ordinary course of our homebuilding business we rely on subcontractors to perform the actual construction of our homes and in many cases to select and obtain construction materials despite our detailed specifications and monitoring of the construction process our subcontractors occasionally do not meet adequate quality standards in the construction of our homes when we find these issues we repair them in accordance with our warranty obligations we spend significant resources to repair items in homes we have sold to fulfill the warranties we issued to our homebuyers additionally we are subject to construction defect claims which can be costly to defend and resolve in the legal system warranty and construction defect matters can also result in negative publicity in the media and on the internet which can damage our reputation and adversely affect our ability to sell homes 

based on the large number of homes we have sold over the years our potential liabilities related to warranty and construction defect claims are significant consequently we have generally maintained product liability insurance each year and we seek to obtain indemnities and certificates of insurance from subcontractors covering claims related to their workmanship and materials we establish warranty and other reserves for the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built because of the uncertainties inherent to these matters we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will be adequate to address all of our future warranty and construction defect claims contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce we may be responsible for applicable selfinsured retentions and some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits additionally the coverage offered by and the availability of product liability insurance for construction defects is limited and costly we have responded to increases in insurance costs and coverage limitations by selfinsuring our risk for certain years and by increasing our selfinsured retentions and claim reserves there can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted or become more costly if costs to resolve our future warranty and construction defect claims exceed our estimates our financial results and liquidity could be adversely affected 

a health and safety incident relating to our operations could be costly in terms of potential liability and reputational damage 

  

building and land development sites are inherently dangerous and operating in this industry poses certain inherent health and safety risks due to health and safety regulatory requirements and the number of homes we construct health and safety performance is critical to the success of our business any failure in health and safety performance including compliance with potential new workplace requirements related to the covid19 pandemic may result in penalties for noncompliance with relevant regulatory requirements and a failure that results in a major or significant health and safety incident is likely to be costly and could expose us to liability that could be costly such an incident could generate significant negative publicity and have a corresponding impact on our reputation our relationships with relevant regulatory agencies or governmental authorities and our ability to attract customers and employees which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and liquidity 

we are required to obtain performance bonds the unavailability of which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

we often are required to provide surety bonds to secure our performance or obligations under construction contracts development agreements and other arrangements at september 30 2021 we had 23 billion of outstanding surety bonds our ability to obtain surety bonds primarily depends upon our credit rating financial condition past performance and other factors including the capacity of the surety market and the underwriting practices of surety bond issuers the ability to obtain surety bonds also can be impacted by the willingness of insurance companies to issue performance bonds for construction and development activities if we are unable to obtain surety bonds when required our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

increases in the costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business or financial results 

significant expenses of owning a home including mortgage loan interest and state and local income and property taxes have historically been deductible expenses for an individual’s federal income taxes subject to various limitations the tax cuts and jobs act which became effective january 1 2018 established new limits on these federal tax deductions that could reduce the actual or perceived affordability of homeownership these or any further changes in income tax laws by the federal or state government to eliminate or substantially reduce income tax benefits associated with homeownership could adversely affect demand for and sales prices of new homes especially in areas with relatively high housing prices or high taxes 

in addition increases in property tax rates by local governmental authorities as experienced in some areas in response to reduced federal and state funding could adversely affect the amount of financing our potential customers could obtain or their desire to purchase new homes 

further existing and prospective regulatory and societal responses to climate change intended to reduce potential climate change impacts may increase the upfront costs of purchasing a home costs to maintain the home and its systems energy and utility costs and the cost to obtain homeowner and various hazard and flood insurance or limit homeowners’ ability to obtain these insurance policies altogether although these items have had no material effect on our business they could adversely affect our business in the future 

governmental regulations and environmental matters could increase the cost and limit the availability of our land development and homebuilding projects and adversely affect our business or financial results 

we are subject to extensive and complex regulations that affect land development and home construction including zoning density restrictions building design and building standards these regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities as to the conditions we must meet prior to development or construction being approved if approved at all we are subject to determinations by these authorities as to the adequacy of water or sewage facilities roads or other local services new housing developments may also be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets and other public improvements in addition in many markets government authorities have implemented no growth or growth control initiatives any of these may limit delay or increase the costs of development or home construction 

we are also subject to a significant number and variety of local state and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of health safety labor standards and the environment the impact of environmental laws varies depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available these matters may result in delays may cause us to incur substantial compliance remediation mitigation and other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas government agencies also routinely initiate audits reviews or investigations of our business practices to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations which can cause us to incur costs or create other disruptions in our business that can be significant 

recently there has been growing concern from advocacy groups government agencies and the general public over the effects of climate change on the environment transition risks such as government restrictions standards or regulations intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and potential climate change impacts are emerging and may increase in the future in the form of restrictions or additional requirements on land development and home construction in certain areas such restrictions and requirements could increase our operating and compliance costs or require additional technology and capital investment which could adversely affect our results of operations this is a particular concern in the western united states where some of the most extensive and stringent environmental laws and residential building construction standards in the country have been enacted and where we have business operations we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with existing climaterelated government restrictions standards and regulations applicable to our business and such compliance has not had a material impact on our business however given the rapidly changing nature of environmental laws and matters that may arise that are not currently known we cannot predict our future exposure concerning such matters and our future costs to achieve compliance or remedy potential violations could be significant 

additionally actual or perceived environmental social governance and other sustainability esg matters and our response to these matters could harm our business increasing governmental and societal attention to esg matters including expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting diligence and disclosure on topics such as climate change human capital labor and risk oversight could expand the nature scope and complexity of matters that we are required to control assess and report these factors may alter the environment in which we do business and may increase the ongoing costs of compliance and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows if we are unable to adequately address such esg matters or fail to comply with all laws regulations policies and related interpretations it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results 

the subcontractors we rely on to perform the actual construction of our homes are also subject to a significant number of local state and federal laws and regulations including laws involving matters that are not within our control if the subcontractors who construct our homes fail to comply with all applicable laws we can suffer reputational damage and may be exposed to possible liability 

we are also subject to an extensive number of laws and regulations because our common stock and debt securities and the common stock of our forestar subsidiary are publicly traded in the capital markets these regulations govern our communications with our shareholders and the capital markets our financial statement disclosures and our legal 

processes and they also impact the work required to be performed by our independent registered public accounting firm and our legal counsel changes in these laws and regulations including the subsequent implementation of rules by the administering government authorities may require us to incur additional compliance costs and such costs may be significant 

governmental regulation of our financial services operations could adversely affect our business or financial results 

our financial services operations are subject to extensive state and federal laws and regulations which are administered by numerous agencies including but not limited to the consumer financial protection bureau federal housing finance agency us department of housing and urban development fha va usda fannie mae freddie mac and ginnie mae these laws and regulations include many compliance requirements including but not limited to licensing consumer disclosures fair lending and real estate settlement procedures as a result our operations are subject to regular extensive examinations by the applicable agencies additional future regulations or changing rule interpretations and examinations by regulatory agencies may result in more stringent compliance standards and could adversely affect the results of our operations 

we operate in competitive industries and competitive conditions could adversely affect our business or financial results 

the homebuilding lot development and rental housing industries are highly competitive we compete not only for homebuyers and renters but also for desirable properties raw materials skilled labor and financing we compete with local regional and national companies in these industries and also with existing home sales foreclosures and rental properties the competitive conditions in these industries can negatively affect our sales volumes selling prices leased occupancy levels rental rates and incentive levels reduce our profit margins and cause the value of our inventory or other assets to be impaired competition can also affect our ability to acquire suitable land raw materials and skilled labor at acceptable prices or terms or cause delays in land development or in construction 

the competitors to our financial services businesses include other mortgage lenders and title companies including national regional and local mortgage banks and other financial institutions some of these competitors are subject to fewer governmental regulations and have greater access to capital than we do may operate with different lending criteria andor may offer a broader or more attractive array of financing and other products and services to potential customers 

our businesses compete with other companies across all industries to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced employees managers and executives competition for the services of these individuals increases as business conditions improve in the homebuilding lot development financial services and rental housing industries and in the general economy if we are unable to attract and retain key employees managers or executives our business could be adversely affected 

risks related to our indebtedness 

we have significant amounts of debt and may incur additional debt which could affect our financial health and our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations or potential acquisitions 

as of september 30 2021 our consolidated debt was 54 billion which consisted of 32 billion related to our homebuilding segment 7045 million related to our forestar segment and 15 billion related to our financial services segment the indentures governing our homebuilding senior notes do not restrict the incurrence of future unsecured debt by us or our homebuilding subsidiaries or the incurrence of secured or unsecured debt by our nonguarantor subsidiaries and the agreement governing our homebuilding revolving credit facility allows us to incur a substantial amount of future unsecured debt also the indentures governing our homebuilding senior notes and the agreement governing our homebuilding revolving credit facility impose restrictions on our ability and on that of the guarantors under our homebuilding senior notes and our homebuilding revolving credit facility to incur debt secured by certain assets but still permit us and our homebuilding subsidiaries to incur significant amounts of additional secured debt the forestar revolving credit facility and the indentures governing forestar’s senior notes impose restrictions on the ability of forestar and its restricted subsidiaries to incur secured and unsecured debt but still permit forestar and its subsidiaries to incur a substantial amount of future secured and unsecured debt and do not restrict the incurrence of future secured and unsecured debt by forestar’s unrestricted subsidiaries 

the amount and the maturities of our debt and the debt of our subsidiaries could have important consequences for example possible consequences for our homebuilding financial services and forestar operations each with respect to their individual debt obligations could 

• require the dedication of a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to payment of debt and reduce the ability to use cash flow for other operating or investing purposes 

• limit the flexibility to adjust to changes in business or economic conditions and 

• limit the ability to obtain future financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions debt service requirements or other requirements 

servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash and we or our subsidiaries may not have sufficient cash flow from our respective businesses to pay our substantial debt 

our ability and that of our subsidiaries to meet our respective debt service obligations will depend in part upon our and our subsidiaries’ future financial performance future results are subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report our revenues and earnings vary with the level of general economic activity in the markets we serve our businesses are also affected by financial political business and other factors many of which are beyond our control the factors that affect our ability to generate cash can also affect our ability to raise additional funds for these purposes through the sale of debt or equity the refinancing of debt or the sale of assets changes in prevailing interest rates may affect the cost of our debt service obligations because borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and mortgage repurchase facility bear interest at floating rates 

the instruments governing our and our subsidiaries’ indebtedness impose certain restrictions on our and our subsidiaries’ business and the ability of us and our subsidiaries to comply with related covenants restrictions or limitations could adversely affect our and our subsidiaries’ financial condition or operating flexibility 

the restrictions imposed by our and certain of our subsidiaries’ indebtedness could limit our or our subsidiaries’ ability to plan for or react to market or economic conditions or meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans and adversely affect our or our subsidiaries’ ability to finance our operations acquisitions investments or strategic alliances or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest 

the agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on our and our guarantor subsidiaries’ ability to among other things engage in sale and leaseback transactions with respect to certain assets incur secured debt create liens pay dividends and make other distributions on or redeem or repurchase equity securities sell certain assets and engage in mergers consolidations or sales of all or substantially all of our assets the instruments governing forestar’s indebtedness contain restrictions on the ability of forestar and certain of its subsidiaries to among other things incur additional indebtedness create liens pay dividends and make other distributions on or redeem or repurchase equity securities sell certain assets enter into affiliate transactions and engage in mergers consolidations or sales of all or substantially all of forestar’s assets 

in addition the agreements governing certain of our and our subsidiaries’ debt instruments contain the following financial covenants 

homebuilding revolving credit facility our homebuilding revolving credit facility contains financial covenants requiring the maintenance of a maximum allowable leverage ratio and a borrowing base restriction if our leverage ratio exceeds a certain level a failure to comply with these financial covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under the revolving credit facility or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity 

forestar’s revolving credit facility the forestar revolving credit facility contains financial covenants requiring the maintenance by forestar of a minimum level of tangible net worth a minimum level of liquidity a maximum allowable leverage ratio and a borrowing base restriction based on the book value of forestar’s real estate assets and unrestricted cash a failure to comply with these financial covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under this revolving credit facility or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity 

mortgage repurchase facility and other restrictions the mortgage repurchase facility for our mortgage subsidiary requires the maintenance of a minimum level of tangible net worth a maximum allowable leverage ratio and a minimum level of liquidity by our mortgage subsidiary a failure to comply with these requirements could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds to our mortgage subsidiary or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity any difficulty experienced in complying with these covenants could make the renewal of the facility more difficult or costly 

in addition although our financial services business is conducted through subsidiaries that are not restricted by the indentures governing our senior notes or the agreement governing our revolving credit facility the ability of our financial services subsidiaries to distribute funds to our homebuilding operations would be restricted in the event such distribution would cause an event of default under the mortgage repurchase facility or if an event of default had occurred under this facility moreover our right to receive assets from our financial services subsidiaries upon their liquidation or recapitalization is subject to the prior claims of the creditors of these subsidiaries any claims we may have to funds from our financial services subsidiaries would be subordinate to subsidiary indebtedness to the extent of any security for such indebtedness and to any indebtedness otherwise recognized as senior to our claims 

our access to capital and our ability to obtain additional financing could be affected by any downgrade of our debt ratings 

our homebuilding senior unsecured debt is currently rated investment grade by all three major rating agencies however there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain these ratings any lowering of our debt ratings could make accessing the public capital markets or obtaining additional credit from banks more difficult andor more expensive any lowering of forestar’s debt ratings could also make forestar’s ability to access the public capital markets or obtain additional credit from banks more difficult andor more expensive 

the instruments governing our indebtedness contain change of control provisions which could affect the timing of repayment 

change of control purchase options under our homebuilding senior notes and change of control default under our homebuilding revolving credit facility upon the occurrence of both a change of control and a ratings downgrade event each as defined in the indentures governing our homebuilding senior notes we will be required to offer to repurchase such notes at 101 of their principal amount together with all accrued and unpaid interest if any moreover a change of control as defined in our homebuilding revolving credit facility would constitute an event of default under our homebuilding revolving credit facility which could result in the acceleration of the repayment of any borrowings outstanding under the facility a requirement to cash collateralize all letters of credit outstanding thereunder and the termination of the commitments thereunder if repayment of more than 50 million outstanding under our homebuilding revolving credit facility were accelerated and such acceleration were not rescinded or such indebtedness were not satisfied in either case within 30 days an event of default would result under the indentures governing our homebuilding senior notes entitling the trustee for the notes or holders of at least 25 in principal amount of the relevant series of notes then outstanding to declare all such notes to be due and payable immediately if purchase offers were required under the indentures for our homebuilding senior notes repayment of the borrowings under our homebuilding revolving credit facility were required or if the senior notes were accelerated we can give no assurance that we would have sufficient funds to pay the required amounts 

change of control purchase option under forestar’s notes and change of control default under the forestar revolving credit facility upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event as defined in the indentures governing forestar’s notes forestar will be required to offer to repurchase forestar’s notes at 101 of their principal amount together with all accrued and unpaid interest if any a change of control as defined in the forestar revolving credit facility with respect to forestar would constitute an event of default under the forestar revolving credit facility which could result in the acceleration of the repayment of any borrowings outstanding under the facility a requirement to cash collateralize all letters of credit outstanding thereunder and the termination of the commitments thereunder if the maturity of the forestar revolving credit facility andor other indebtedness of forestar and its restricted subsidiaries together having an aggregate principal amount outstanding of 40 million or more is accelerated an event of default would result under the indentures governing the forestar notes entitling the trustee for the forestar notes or holders of at least 25 in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding forestar notes to declare all such forestar notes to be due and payable immediately if purchase offers were required under the indentures for forestar’s notes repayment of the borrowings under forestar’s revolving credit facility were required or if forestar’s notes were accelerated we can give no assurance that forestar would have sufficient funds to pay the required amounts 

general risk factors 

damage to our corporate reputation or brands from negative publicity could adversely affect our business financial results andor stock price 

adverse publicity related to our company industry personnel operations or business performance may cause damage to our corporate reputation or brands and may generate negative sentiment potentially affecting the performance of our business or our stock price regardless of its accuracy or inaccuracy our reputation could be adversely affected by actual or perceived failures or concerns related to ethics compliance product quality and safety environmental matters privacy diversity and inclusion human rights compensation and benefits and corporate governance among other things negative publicity can be disseminated rapidly through digital platforms including social media websites blogs and newsletters customers and other interested parties value readily available information and often act on such information without further investigation and without regard to its accuracy the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction and our success in preserving our brand image depends on our ability to recognize respond to and effectively manage negative publicity in a rapidly changing environment adverse publicity or unfavorable commentary from any source could damage our reputation reduce the demand for our homes or negatively impact the morale and performance of our employees which could adversely affect our business 

our business could be adversely affected by the loss of key personnel 

we rely on our key personnel to effectively operate and manage our businesses specifically our success depends heavily on the performance of our homebuilding division and region presidents and their management teams our rental housing management team our financial services management team our corporate office management teams our forestar management team and our executive officers these key personnel have significant experience and skills in the homebuilding lot development financial services and rental housing industries as well as leadership and management abilities that are vital to our success our ability to attract and retain our key personnel may be impacted by matters involving reputation culture diversity and inclusion compensation and benefits and our management of executive succession we seek to retain our key personnel and to have succession plans in place to address the potential loss of key personnel however if our retention and succession planning efforts are unsuccessful or if we fail to attract suitable replacements the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business 

our business could be negatively impacted as a result of actions by activist stockholders or others 

we may be subject to actions or proposals from activist stockholders or others that may not align with our business strategies or the interests of our other stockholders responding to such actions could be costly and timeconsuming disrupt our business and operations andor divert the attention of our board of directors and senior management from the pursuit of our business strategies activist stockholders may create perceived uncertainties as to the future direction of our business or strategy including with respect to our esg efforts which may be exploited by our competitors and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel potential homebuyers and business partners and may affect our relationships with current homebuyers subcontractors investors and other third parties in addition actions of activist stockholders may cause periods of fluctuation in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business 

information technology failures data security breaches and the failure to satisfy privacy and data protection laws and regulations could harm our business 

we use information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational and marketing activities and to maintain our business records these information technology systems are dependent upon global communications providers web browsers thirdparty software and data storage providers and other aspects of the internet infrastructure that have experienced security breaches cyberattacks ransomware attacks significant systems failures and service outages in the past our normal business activities involve collecting and storing information specific to our homebuyers renters employees vendors and suppliers and maintaining operational and financial information related to our business both in an office setting and remote locations as needed a material breach in the security of our information technology systems or other data security controls could include the theft or release of this information a data security breach a significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems or a breach of any of our data security controls could disrupt our business operations damage our reputation and cause us to 

lose customers adversely impact our sales and revenue and require us to incur significant expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve these kinds of issues the unintended or unauthorized disclosure of personal identifying and confidential information as a result of a security breach could also lead to litigation or other proceedings against us by the affected individuals or business partners or by regulators the outcome of such proceedings which could include penalties or fines could have a significant negative impact on our business 

we may also be required to incur significant costs to protect against damages caused by information technology failures security breaches and the failure to satisfy privacy and data protection laws and regulations in the future as legal requirements continue to increase the european union and other international regulators as well as state governments have recently enacted or enhanced data privacy regulations such as the california consumer privacy act and other governments are considering establishing similar or stronger protections these regulations impose certain obligations for handling specified personal information in our systems and for apprising individuals of the information we have collected about them we have incurred costs in an effort to comply with these requirements and our costs may increase significantly if new requirements are enacted and based on how individuals exercise their rights any noncompliance could result in our incurring substantial penalties and reputational damage and also could result in litigation 

we provide employee awareness training of cybersecurity threats and routinely utilize information technology security experts to assist us in our evaluations of the effectiveness of the security of our information technology systems and we regularly enhance our security measures to protect our systems and data our increased use of remote work environments and virtual platforms in response to the covid19 pandemic may also increase our risk of cyberattack or data security breaches we use various encryption tokenization and authentication technologies to mitigate cybersecurity risks and have increased our monitoring capabilities to enhance early detection and rapid response to potential cyber threats however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade systems change frequently and are increasing in sophistication they often are not recognized until launched against a target as such we may be unable to anticipate these techniques to implement adequate preventative measures or to identify and investigate cybersecurity incidents consequently we cannot provide assurances that a security breach cyberattack data theft or other significant systems or security failures will not occur in the future and such occurrences could have a material and adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position

results of operations — overview 

fiscal 2021 operating results 

in fiscal 2021 our number of homes closed and home sales revenues increased 25 and 35 respectively compared to the prior year and our consolidated revenues increased 37 to 278 billion compared to 203 billion in the prior year our pretax income was 54 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to 30 billion in fiscal 2020 and our pretax operating margin was 193 compared to 147 net income was 42 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to 24 billion in fiscal 2020 and our diluted earnings per share was 1141 compared to 641 

cash provided by our homebuilding operations was 12 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to 19 billion in fiscal 2020 in fiscal 2021 our return on equity roe was 316 compared to 221 in fiscal 2020 and our homebuilding return on inventory roi was 379 compared to 246 roe is calculated as net income attributable to dr horton for the year divided by average stockholders’ equity where average stockholders’ equity is the sum of ending stockholders’ equity balances of the trailing five quarters divided by five homebuilding roi is calculated as homebuilding pretax income for the year divided by average inventory where average inventory is the sum of ending homebuilding inventory balances for the trailing five quarters divided by five 

during march 2020 the impacts of the covid19 pandemic and the related widespread reductions in economic activity across the united states began to adversely affect our business as economic activity resumed and restrictive orders relating to covid19 were eased demand for our homes improved significantly during the remainder of fiscal 2020 and remained strong throughout fiscal 2021 we believe the increase in demand has been fueled by historically low interest rates on mortgage loans and the limited supply of homes at affordable price points across most of our markets we are wellpositioned for increased demand with our affordable product offerings lot supply and housing inventory however multiple disruptions in the supply chain combined with the improvement in economic conditions and strong demand for new homes have resulted in shortages in certain building materials and tightness in the labor market which has caused our construction cycle to lengthen we have slowed our home sales pace to more closely align with our production levels and we are selling homes later in the construction cycle when we have more certainty regarding the home close date for our homebuyers based on the current availability of labor and materials the stage of completion of our current homes in inventory production schedules and capacity we expect to continue restricting the pace of our sales orders in many of our communities in the near term to match our production levels 

within our homebuilding land and lot portfolio our lots controlled through purchase contracts represent 76 of the lots owned and controlled at september 30 2021 compared to 70 at september 30 2020 our relationship with forestar and expanded relationships with other land developers across the country have allowed us to continue to increase the controlled portion of our lot pipeline 

we believe our strong balance sheet and liquidity position provide us with the flexibility to operate effectively through changing economic conditions we plan to continue to generate strong cash flows from our homebuilding operations and manage our product offerings incentives home pricing sales pace and inventory levels to optimize the return on our inventory investments in each of our communities based on local housing market conditions 

strategy 

our operating strategy focuses on enhancing longterm value to our shareholders by leveraging our financial and competitive position in our core homebuilding business to maximize the returns on our inventory investments and generate strong profitability and cash flows while managing risk and maintaining financial flexibility to navigate changing economic conditions and make opportunistic strategic investments our strategy remains consistent and includes the following initiatives 

• developing and retaining highly experienced and productive teams of personnel throughout our company that are aligned and focused on continuous improvement in our operational execution and financial performance 

• maintaining a strong cash balance and overall liquidity position and controlling our level of debt 

• allocating and actively managing our inventory investments across our operating markets to diversify our geographic risk 

• offering new home communities that appeal to a broad range of entrylevel moveup active adult and luxury homebuyers based on consumer demand in each market 

• modifying product offerings sales pace home prices and sales incentives as necessary in each of our markets to meet consumer demand and maintain affordability 

• delivering high quality homes and a positive experience to our customers both during and after the sale 

• managing our inventory of homes under construction relative to demand in each of our markets including starting construction on unsold homes to capture new home demand and actively controlling the number of unsold completed homes in inventory 

• investing in land and land development in desirable markets while controlling the level of land and lots we own in each market relative to the local new home demand 

• continuing to seek opportunities to expand the portion of our land and finished lots controlled through purchase contracts with forestar and other land developers 

• controlling the cost of goods purchased from both vendors and subcontractors 

• improving the efficiency of our land development construction sales and other key operational activities 

• controlling our selling general and administrative sga expense infrastructure to match production levels 

• opportunistically evaluating potential acquisitions to enhance our operations and improve returns 

• ensuring that our financial services business provides high quality mortgage and title services to homebuyers efficiently and effectively 

• increasing our investments in the construction and leasing of singlefamily and multifamily rental properties to meet rental demand in high growth suburban markets and selling these properties profitably 

we believe our operating strategy which has produced positive results in recent years will allow us to successfully operate through changing economic conditions to maintain and improve our financial and competitive position however we cannot provide any assurances that the initiatives listed above will continue to be successful and we may need to adjust parts of our strategy to meet future market conditions

results of operations — homebuilding 

due to the change in aggregation of our homebuilding operating segments into six new reportable segments during fiscal 2021 the following tables and related discussion of our homebuilding results include comparative information for the fiscal years ended september 30 2021 2020 and 2019 

based on the new aggregation our six reporting segments and the states in which we have homebuilding operations are as follows 





 

1 net sales orders represent the number and dollar value of new sales contracts executed with customers gross sales orders net of cancelled sales orders 



 

1 cancellation rate represents the number of cancelled sales orders divided by gross sales orders 

net sales orders 

2021 versus 2020 

the number of net sales orders increased 4 during 2021 compared to 2020 and the value of net sales orders increased 18 to 277 billion 81378 homes in 2021 from 236 billion 78458 homes in 2020 the average selling price of net sales orders during fiscal 2021 was 341000 up 13 from the prior year 

during fiscal 2021 demand for homes remained strong however multiple disruptions in the supply chain combined with the improvement in economic conditions and strong demand for new homes have resulted in shortages in certain building materials and tightness in the labor market which has caused our construction cycle to lengthen as a result during the second half of fiscal 2021 we slowed our home sales pace to more closely align with our production levels and we are selling homes later in the construction cycle when we have more certainty regarding the home close date for our homebuyers based on the stage of completion of our current homes in inventory production schedules and capacity we expect to continue restricting the pace of our sales orders in many of our communities in the near term to match our production levels although these challenges may persist for some time we expect to ultimately increase our production capacity and close more homes in fiscal 2022 than we closed in fiscal 2021 

in regions with an increase in sales volume the markets contributing most to the increases were the san antonio and dallas markets in the south central and the florida markets particularly tampa in the southeast in regions with a decrease in sales volume the markets having the most effect were as follows the seattle and portland markets in the northwest the phoenix market in the southwest the charlotte and atlanta markets in the east and the minneapolis market in the north 

our sales order cancellation rate cancelled sales orders divided by gross sales orders for the period was 17 in 2021 compared to 20 in 2020 

2020 versus 2019 

the number of net sales orders increased 39 during 2020 compared to 2019 with significant increases in all of our regions the value of net sales orders increased 40 to 236 billion 78458 homes in 2020 from 168 billion 56565 homes in 2019 the average selling price of net sales orders during 2020 was 300900 up 1 from the prior year 

the markets contributing most to the increases in sales volumes in our regions were as follows the denver and portland markets in the northwest the phoenix and california markets in the southwest the houston and dallas markets in the south central the florida markets particularly tampa in the southeast the carolina markets particularly myrtle beach and charlotte in the east and the minneapolis delaware and indiana markets in the north 

our sales order cancellation rate cancelled sales orders divided by gross sales orders for the period was 20 in 2020 compared to 21 in 2019 



sales order backlog 

sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies including mortgage loan approval and buyers selling their existing homes which can result in cancellations a portion of the contracts in backlog will not result in closings due to cancellations 



home sales revenue 

2021 versus 2020 

revenues from home sales increased 35 to 265 billion 81965 homes closed in 2021 from 196 billion 65388 homes closed in 2020 home sales revenues increased in all of our regions due to an increase in the number of homes closed and to a lesser extent an increase in average selling prices 

the number of homes closed in 2021 increased 25 from 2020 the markets contributing most to the increased closing volumes in our regions were as follows the denver and salt lake city markets in the northwest the phoenix and california markets in the southwest the houston and dallas markets in the south central the florida markets particularly tampa in the southeast the carolina markets particularly myrtle beach in the east and the indiana and delaware markets in the north 

2020 versus 2019 

revenues from home sales increased 16 to 196 billion 65388 homes closed in 2020 from 169 billion 56975 homes closed in 2019 home sales revenues increased in all of our regions primarily due to an increase in the number of homes closed 

the number of homes closed in 2020 increased 15 from 2019 the markets contributing most to the increase in closing volumes in our regions were as follows the denver and portland markets in the northwest the california markets in the southwest the houston dallas and san antonio markets in the south central the florida markets particularly tampa in the southeast the carolina markets particularly myrtle beach and charlotte in the east and the delaware indiana and iowa markets in the north 

homebuilding operating margin analysis 



home sales gross profit 

2021 versus 2020 

gross profit from home sales increased to 69 billion in 2021 from 43 billion in 2020 and increased 370 basis points to 255 as a percentage of home sales revenues the percentage increase resulted from improvements of 340 basis points due to the average selling price of our homes closed increasing by more than the average cost of those homes 20 basis points due to a decrease in the amortization of capitalized interest and 10 basis points due to a decrease in warranty and construction defect costs 

we remain focused on managing the pricing incentives and sales pace in each of our communities to optimize the returns on our inventory investments and adjust to local market conditions and new home demand these actions could cause our gross profit margins to fluctuate in future periods if new home demand declines from current levels we would expect our gross profit margins to also decline 

2020 versus 2019 

gross profit from home sales increased to 43 billion in 2020 from 34 billion in 2019 and increased 160 basis points to 218 as a percentage of home sales revenues the percentage increase resulted from improvements of 150 basis points due to a decrease in the average cost of our homes closed while the average selling price increased slightly 20 basis points from a decrease in the amount of purchase accounting adjustments related to prior year acquisitions and 10 basis points due to a decrease in the amortization of capitalized interest partially offset by increased warranty and construction defect costs of 20 basis points 

landlot sales and other revenues 

landlot sales and other revenues from our homebuilding operations were 750 million 807 million and 919 million in fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively we continually evaluate our land and lot supply and fluctuations in revenues and profitability from land sales occur based on how we manage our inventory levels in various markets we generally purchase land and lots with the intent to build and sell homes on them however some of the land that we purchase includes commercially zoned parcels that we may sell to commercial developers we may also sell residential lots or land parcels to manage our supply or for other strategic reasons as of september 30 2021 our homebuilding operations had 254 million of land held for sale that we expect to sell in the next twelve months 

inventory and land option charges 

at the end of each quarter we review the performance and outlook for all of our communities and land inventories for indicators of potential impairment and perform detailed impairment evaluations and analyses when necessary as of september 30 2021 we determined that no communities were impaired and no impairment charges were recorded during the three months ended september 30 2021 there were 56 million of homebuilding impairment charges recorded during fiscal 2021 compared to 17 million and 249 million of impairment charges recorded in fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively 

as we manage our inventory investments across our operating markets to optimize returns and cash flows we may modify our pricing and incentives construction and development plans or land sale strategies in individual active communities and land held for development which could result in the affected communities being evaluated for potential impairment if the housing market or economic conditions are adversely affected for a prolonged period we may be required to evaluate additional communities for potential impairment these evaluations could result in additional impairment charges which could be significant 

during fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs related to land purchase contracts that we have terminated or expect to terminate were 193 million 212 million and 283 million respectively 

selling general and administrative sga expense 

sga expense from homebuilding activities was 19 billion 16 billion and 15 billion in fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively an increase of 22 in 2021 and 8 in 2020 from the respective prior years sga expense as a percentage of homebuilding revenues was 73 81 and 87 in fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

employee compensation and related costs were 16 billion 12 billion and 11 billion in fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively representing 81 75 and 72 of sga costs in those years these costs increased 31 in 2021 and 13 in 2020 our homebuilding operations employed 8429 7281 and 6810 people at september 30 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

we attempt to control our sga costs while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports our operations however we cannot make assurances that we will be able to maintain or improve upon the current sga expense as a percentage of revenues 

interest incurred 

we capitalize interest costs incurred to inventory during active development and construction active inventory capitalized interest is charged to cost of sales as the related inventory is delivered to the buyer interest incurred by our homebuilding operations was 936 million 930 million and 1047 million in fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively interest charged to cost of sales was 07 08 and 09 of total cost of sales excluding inventory and land option charges in those years 

other income 

other income net of other expenses included in our homebuilding operations was 103 million 117 million and 95 million in fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively other income consists of interest income and various other types of ancillary income gains expenses and losses not directly associated with sales of homes land and lots the activities that result in this ancillary income are not significant either individually or in the aggregate 

business acquisition 

in october 2020 we acquired the homebuilding operations of braselton homes in corpus christi texas for approximately 230 million in cash the assets acquired included approximately 90 homes in inventory 95 lots and control of approximately 840 additional lots through purchase contracts we also acquired a sales order backlog of approximately 125 homes

results of operations — financial services 

the following tables and related discussion set forth key operating and financial data for our financial services operations comprising dhi mortgage and our subsidiary title companies for the fiscal years ended september 30 2021 and 2020 





financial services operating margin analysis 



mortgage loan activity 

the volume of loans originated by our mortgage operations is directly related to the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations in fiscal 2021 the volume of firstlien loans originated or brokered by dhi mortgage for our homebuyers increased 23 from the prior year due to a 25 increase in the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations 

homes closed by our homebuilding operations constituted 98 and 97 of dhi mortgage loan originations in fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively these percentages reflect dhi mortgage’s consistent focus on the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations 

the number of loans sold increased 24 in fiscal 2021 compared to the prior year virtually all of the mortgage loans held for sale on september 30 2021 were eligible for sale to fannie mae freddie mac or ginnie mae during fiscal 2021 approximately 52 of our mortgage loans were sold directly to fannie mae or into securities backed by ginnie mae and 41 were sold to two other major financial entities changes in market conditions could result in a greater concentration of our mortgage sales in future periods to fewer financial entities and directly to fannie mae or ginnie mae and we may need to make other adjustments to our mortgage operations 

financial services revenues and expenses 

revenues from our mortgage operations increased 41 to 6708 million in fiscal 2021 from 4767 million in fiscal 2020 primarily due to a 22 increase in loan originations and higher net gains achieved on the sale of loan originations in the secondary market revenues from our title operations increased 41 to 1528 million in fiscal 2021 from 1082 million in fiscal 2020 primarily due to a 30 increase in escrow closings 

general and administrative ga expense related to our financial services operations increased 34 to 4883 million in fiscal 2021 from 3647 million in the prior year the increase was primarily due to an increase in employee related costs to support a higher volume of transactions our financial services operations employed 2891 and 2163 people at september 30 2021 and 2020 respectively 

as a percentage of financial services revenues ga expense was 593 in fiscal 2021 compared to 624 in the prior year fluctuations in financial services ga expense as a percentage of revenues can occur because some components of revenue fluctuate differently than loan volumes and some expenses are not directly related to mortgage loan volume or to changes in the amount of revenue earned 

other income net of other expense included in our financial services operations consists primarily of the interest income of our mortgage subsidiary 

as a result of the revenue increase from a higher volume of mortgage originations and escrow closings and better leverage of our ga expenses pretax income from our financial services operations increased 49 to 3646 million in fiscal 2021 from 2452 million in fiscal 2020 

results of operations — rental 

our rental segment consists of multifamily and singlefamily rental operations the multifamily rental operations develop construct lease own and ultimately sell the residential properties we primarily focus on constructing garden style multifamily rental communities which typically accommodate 200 to 400 dwelling units in high growth suburban markets the singlefamily rental operations construct singlefamily rental homes with the intent to later market the community for a bulk sale of homes multifamily and singlefamily rental property sales are recognized as revenues and rental income is recognized as other income results of operations for the rental segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2021 and 2020 were as follows

results of operations — consolidated 

income before income taxes 

pretax income was 54 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to 30 billion in fiscal 2020 the increase was primarily due to an increase in pretax income generated by our homebuilding operations as a result of higher revenues from increased home closings and an increase in home sales gross margin in fiscal 2021 our homebuilding financial services forestar and rental businesses generated pretax income of 48 billion 3646 million 1466 million and 865 million respectively compared to 27 billion 2452 million 781 million and 398 million respectively in fiscal 2020 

income taxes 

our income tax expense was 12 billion and 6025 million in fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively and our effective tax rate was 218 and 202 in those years the effective tax rates in fiscal 2021 and 2020 include an expense for state income taxes tax benefits related to stockbased compensation and a reduction of 22 and 31 respectively for tax benefits related to the federal energy efficient homes tax credit our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 also includes a reduction of 04 for a tax benefit related to the release of a valuation allowance against our state deferred tax assets 

our deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities were 1595 million at september 30 2021 compared to 1524 million at september 30 2020 we have a valuation allowance of 42 million and 75 million at september 30 2021 and 2020 respectively related to state deferred tax assets for net operating loss nol carryforwards that are more likely than not to expire before being realized we will continue to evaluate both the positive and negative evidence in determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to our remaining state nol carryforwards any reversal of the valuation allowance in future periods will impact our effective tax rate 

dr horton has 103 million of tax benefits for state nol carryforwards that expire at various times depending on the tax jurisdiction of the total amount 29 million of the tax benefits expire over the next ten years and the remaining 74 million expire from fiscal years 2032 to 2041 forestar has 14 million of tax benefits for state nol carryforwards that expire at various times depending on the tax jurisdiction 

the accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future results could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position also changes in existing federal and state tax laws and tax rates could affect future tax results and the valuation of our deferred tax assets 

unrecognized tax benefits are the differences between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefits recognized in our financial statements our unrecognized tax benefits totaled 29 million and 89 million at september 30 2021 and 2020 respectively 

dr horton is subject to federal income tax and state income tax in multiple jurisdictions the statute of limitations for dr horton’s major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for fiscal years 2018 through 2021 a federal refund claim related to the retroactive extension of energy efficient homes tax credits for fiscal year 2018 is currently under audit by the internal revenue service dr horton is under audit by various states however we are not aware of any significant findings by the state taxing authorities 

forestar is subject to federal income tax and state income tax in multiple jurisdictions the statute of limitations for forestar’s major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for tax years 2016 through 2021 forestar is not currently under audit for federal or state income taxes 

capital resources and liquidity 

we have historically funded our operations with cash flows from operating activities borrowings under bank credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities our current levels of cash borrowing capacity and balance sheet leverage provide us with the operational flexibility to adjust to changes in economic and market conditions 

during fiscal 2021 and currently we have and continue to increase our investments in homebuilding inventories and singlefamily and multifamily rental properties to expand our operations and grow our revenues and profitability as well as consider opportunistic strategic investments as they may arise we are also returning capital to our shareholders through dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock in the last two fiscal years we have maintained higher homebuilding cash balances than in prior years to support the increased scale and level of activity in our business and to provide flexibility to adjust to changing conditions and opportunities 

at september 30 2021 our ratio of debt to total capital notes payable divided by stockholders’ equity plus notes payable was 267 compared to 266 at september 30 2020 our ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital homebuilding notes payable divided by stockholders’ equity plus homebuilding notes payable was 178 compared to 175 at september 30 2020 over the long term we intend to maintain our ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital below 30 and we expect it to remain significantly lower than 30 throughout fiscal 2022 we believe that the ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital is useful in understanding the leverage employed in our homebuilding operations and comparing our capital structure with other homebuilders we exclude the debt of forestar and our financial services business because they are separately capitalized and not guaranteed by our parent company or any of our homebuilding entities 

as of september 30 2021 we had outstanding notes payable with varying maturities totaling an aggregate principal amount of 54 billion with 19 billion payable within 12 months future interest payments associated with the notes total 4514 million with 1564 million payable within 12 months

we regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund growth in our business repay debt obligations pay dividends repurchase our common stock and maintain sufficient cash levels to support our other operational needs and we regularly evaluate our opportunities to raise additional capital dr horton has an automatically effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec in july 2021 registering debt and equity securities that may be issued from time to time in amounts to be determined forestar also has an effective shelf registration statement filed with the sec in september 2018 registering 500 million of equity securities at september 30 2021 3599 million remained available under forestar’s shelf registration statement of which 656 million was reserved for sales under its atthemarket equity offering program in october 2021 after the expiration of forestar’s existing registration statement and atthemarket equity offering program a new shelf registration statement became effective registering 750 million of equity securities forestar anticipates entering into a new atthemarket equity offering program under this new registration statement as market conditions permit we may issue new debt or equity securities through the capital markets or obtain additional bank financing to fund our projected capital requirements or provide additional liquidity we believe that our existing cash resources revolving credit facilities mortgage repurchase facility and ability to access the capital markets or obtain additional bank financing will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our nearterm working capital needs and debt obligations

all of the homebuilding senior notes and the homebuilding revolving credit facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by certain subsidiaries of dr horton inc guarantors or guarantor subsidiaries each of the guarantor subsidiaries is 100 owned directly or indirectly by dr horton inc our subsidiaries associated with the forestar lot development operations financial services operations multifamily residential construction and certain other subsidiaries do not guarantee the homebuilding senior notes or the homebuilding revolving credit facility collectively nonguarantor subsidiaries the guarantees are senior unsecured obligations of each guarantor and rank equal with all existing and future senior debt of such guarantor and senior to all subordinated debt of such guarantor the guarantees are effectively subordinated to any secured debt of such guarantor to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt the guarantees will be structurally subordinated to indebtedness and other liabilities of nonguarantor subsidiaries of the guarantors 

the guarantees by a guarantor subsidiary will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon 1 the sale or other disposition of its common stock whereby it is no longer a subsidiary of ours 2 the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets other than to us or another guarantor 3 its merger or consolidation with an entity other than us or another guarantor or 4 its ceasing to guarantee any of our publicly traded debt securities and ceasing to guarantee any of our obligations under our homebuilding revolving credit facility 

the following tables present summarized financial information for dr horton inc and the guarantor subsidiaries on a combined basis after intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated among dr horton inc and the guarantor subsidiaries as well as their investment in and equity in earnings from the nonguarantor subsidiaries 



a court could void or subordinate any guarantor’s guarantee under the fraudulent conveyance laws if existing or future creditors of any such guarantor were successful in establishing that i such guarantee was incurred with fraudulent intent or ii such guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for issuing its guarantee and was insolvent at the time of the guarantee was rendered insolvent by reason of the guarantee was engaged in a business or transaction for which its assets constituted unreasonably small capital to carry on its business or intended to incur or believed that it would incur debt beyond its ability to pay such debt as it matured 

the measures of insolvency for purposes of determining whether a fraudulent conveyance occurred would vary depending upon the laws of the relevant jurisdiction and upon the valuation assumptions and methodology applied by the court generally however a company would be considered insolvent for purposes of the foregoing if the sum of the company’s debts including contingent unliquidated and unmatured liabilities is greater than all of such company’s property at a fair valuation or if the present fair saleable value of the company’s assets is less than the amount that will be required to pay the probable liability on its existing debts as they become absolute and matured 

the indentures governing our homebuilding senior notes contain a “savings clause” which limits the liability of each guarantor on its guarantee to the maximum amount that such guarantor can incur without risk that its guarantee will be subject to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer this provision may not be effective to protect such guarantees from fraudulent transfer challenges or if it does it may reduce such guarantor’s obligation such that the remaining amount due and collectible under the guarantees would not suffice if necessary to pay the notes in full when due 

on the basis of historical financial information operating history and other factors we believe that each of the guarantors after giving effect to the issuance of the guarantees when such guarantees were issued was not insolvent did not have unreasonably small capital for the business in which it engaged and did not and has not incurred debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature we cannot assure you however as to what standard a court would apply in making these determinations or that a court would agree with our conclusions in this regard 

seasonality 

although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again in the future we generally close more homes and generate greater revenues and pretax income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year the seasonal nature of our business can also cause significant variations in the working capital requirements for our homebuilding lot development financial services and rental operations as a result of seasonal activity our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year

critical accounting policies and estimates 

general  — a comprehensive enumeration of the significant accounting policies of dr horton inc and subsidiaries is presented in note a to the accompanying financial statements as of september 30 2021 and 2020 and for the years ended september 30 2021 2020 and 2019 each of our accounting policies has been chosen based upon current authoritative literature that collectively comprises us generally accepted accounting principles gaap in instances where alternative methods of accounting are permissible under gaap we have chosen the method that most appropriately reflects the nature of our business the results of our operations and our financial condition and have consistently applied those methods over each of the periods presented in the financial statements the audit committee of our board of directors has reviewed and approved the accounting policies selected 

we believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition  — we generally recognize homebuilding revenue and related profit at the time of the closing of a sale when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer our performance obligation to deliver the agreedupon home is generally satisfied in less than one year from the original contract date proceeds from home closings held for our benefit at title companies are included in homebuilding cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets 

when we execute sales contracts with our homebuyers or when we require advance payment from homebuyers for custom changes upgrades or options related to their homes we record the cash deposits received as liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are cancelled we either retain or refund to the homebuyer deposits on cancelled sales contracts depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances 

forestar’s land and lot sales revenue and related profit are generally recognized at the time of the closing of a sale when title to and possession of the property are transferred to a thirdparty buyer forestar’s revenues from land and lot sales to dr horton are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 

we rarely purchase unimproved land for resale but periodically may elect to sell parcels of land that no longer fit into our strategic operating plans revenue from land sales is typically recognized on the closing date which is generally when performance obligations are satisfied 

we recognize financial services revenues associated with our title operations as closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued both of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed revenues associated with our mortgage operations primarily include net gains on the sale of mortgage loans and servicing rights we typically elect the fair value option for our mortgage loan originations whereby mortgage loans held for sale are recorded at fair value based on either sale commitments or current market quotes and loan values are adjusted through revenues for subsequent changes in fair value until the loans are sold expected gains and losses from the sale of servicing rights are included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through revenues at the time of commitment we sell substantially all of the mortgages we originate and the related servicing rights to thirdparty purchasers interest income is earned from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold 

mortgage loans are sold with limited recourse provisions which can result in repurchases of loans previously sold to investors or payments to reimburse investors for loan losses based on historical experience analysis of the volume of mortgages we originated discussions with our mortgage purchasers and current housing and credit market conditions we estimate and record a loss reserve for mortgage loans held in portfolio and mortgage loans held for sale as well as known and projected mortgage loan repurchase requests 

inventories and cost of sales  — inventory includes the costs of direct land acquisition land development and construction capitalized interest real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and construction costs that we incur after projects or homes are substantially complete such as utilities maintenance and cleaning are charged to sga expense as incurred all indirect overhead costs such as compensation of sales personnel division and region management and the costs of advertising and builder’s risk insurance are charged to sga expense as incurred 

land and development costs are typically allocated to individual residential lots on a prorata basis and the costs of residential lots are transferred to construction in progress when home construction begins home construction costs are specifically identified and recorded to individual homes cost of sales for homes closed includes the specific construction costs of each home and all applicable land acquisition land development and related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred allocated to each residential lot based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each community cost of sales for lots sold includes all applicable land acquisition land development and related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred allocated to each residential lot in the community any changes to the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial home or lot closings in a community are generally allocated on a prorata basis to the remaining homes or lots in the community associated with the relevant development activity 

when a home is closed we generally have not paid all incurred costs necessary to complete the home we record a liability and a corresponding charge to cost of sales for the amount estimated to ultimately be paid related to completed homes that have been closed we compare our home construction budgets to actual recorded costs to determine the additional costs remaining to be paid on each closed home we monitor the accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on closed homes in subsequent months to the amounts previously accrued although actual costs to be paid in the future on previously closed homes could differ from our current accruals such differences have not been significant 

at the end of each quarter we review the performance and outlook for all of our communities and land inventories for indicators of potential impairment we generally review our inventory for impairment indicators at the community level and the inventory within each community is categorized as land held for development residential land and lots developed and under development land held for sale rental properties and construction in progress and finished homes based on the stage of production or plans for future development or sale a particular community often includes inventory in more than one category in certain situations inventory may be analyzed separately for impairment purposes based on its product type or future plans in reviewing each of our communities we determine if impairment indicators exist on inventory held and used by analyzing a variety of factors including but not limited to the following 

• gross margins on homes closed in recent months 

• projected gross margins on homes sold but not closed 

• projected gross margins based on community budgets 

• projected gross margins of rental property sales 

• trends in gross margins average selling prices or cost of sales 

• sales absorption rates and 

• performance of other communities in nearby locations 

if indicators of impairment are present for a community we perform an impairment evaluation of the community which includes an analysis to determine if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts if so impairment charges are recorded to cost of sales if the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying amounts these estimates of cash flows are significantly impacted by community specific factors including estimates of the amounts and timing of future revenues and estimates of the amount of land development materials and labor costs which in turn may be impacted by the following local market conditions 

• supply and availability of new and existing homes 

• location and desirability of our communities 

• variety of product types offered in the area 

• pricing and use of incentives by us and our competitors 

• alternative uses for our land or communities such as the sale of land finished lots or home sites to third parties 

• amount of land and lots we own or control in a particular market or submarket and 

• local economic and demographic trends 

for those assets deemed to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets our determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams when an impairment charge for a community is determined the charge is then allocated to each lot in the community in the same manner as land and development costs are allocated to each lot impairment charges are also recorded on finished homes in substantially completed communities and completed rental properties when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values are greater than the fair values less estimated costs to sell these homes 

we rarely purchase land for resale however when we own land or communities under development that do not fit into our development and construction plans and we determine that we will sell the asset the project is accounted for as land held for sale if certain criteria are met we record land held for sale at the lesser of its carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell in performing the impairment evaluation for land held for sale we consider several factors including but not limited to recent offers received to purchase the property prices for land in recent comparable sales transactions and market analysis studies which include the estimated price a willing buyer would pay for the land if the estimated fair value less costs to sell an asset is less than the current carrying value the asset is written down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell 

the key assumptions relating to inventory valuations are impacted by local market and economic conditions and are inherently uncertain although our quarterly assessments reflect management’s best estimates due to uncertainties in the estimation process actual results could differ from such estimates 

warranty claims  — we typically provide our homebuyers with a tenyear limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems a twoyear limited warranty on major mechanical systems and a oneyear limited warranty on other construction components since we subcontract our construction work to subcontractors who typically provide us with an indemnity and a certificate of insurance prior to receiving payments for their work claims relating to workmanship and materials are generally the primary responsibility of the subcontractors warranty liabilities have been established by charging cost of sales for each home delivered the amounts charged are based on management’s estimate of expected warrantyrelated costs under all unexpired warranty obligation periods our warranty liability is based upon historical warranty cost experience in each market in which we operate and is adjusted to reflect qualitative risks associated with the types of homes we build and the geographic areas in which we build them actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts a 10 change in the historical warranty rates used to estimate our warranty accrual would not result in a material change in our accrual for additional information regarding our warranty liability see note l “commitments and contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

legal claims and insurance  — we are named as a defendant in various claims complaints and other legal actions in the ordinary course of business at any point in time we are managing several hundred individual claims related to construction defect matters personal injury claims employment matters land development issues contract disputes and other matters we have established reserves for these contingencies based on the estimated costs of pending claims and the estimated costs of anticipated future claims related to previously closed homes approximately 99 of these reserves related to construction defect matters at both september 30 2021 and 2020 

our reserves for construction defect claims include the estimated costs of both known claims and anticipated future claims at september 30 2021 and 2020 we had reserves for approximately 380 and 260 pending construction defect claims respectively and no individual existing claim was material to our financial statements during fiscal 2021 we were notified of approximately 235 new construction defect claims and resolved 115 construction defect claims for a total cost of 165 million we have closed a significant number of homes during recent years and we may be subject to future construction defect claims on these homes although regulations vary from state to state construction defect issues can generally be reported for up to ten years after the home has closed in many states in which we operate historical data and trends regarding the frequency of claims incurred and the costs to resolve claims relative to the types of products and markets where we operate are used to estimate the construction defect liabilities for both existing and anticipated future claims these estimates are subject to ongoing revision as the circumstances of individual pending claims and historical data and trends change adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the accounting period in which the change in estimate occurs 

historical trends in construction defect claims have been inconsistent and we believe they may continue to fluctuate we also believe that fluctuations in housing market conditions can affect the frequency and cost of construction defect claims if the ultimate resolution of construction defect claims resulting from our home closings in prior years varies from current expectations it could significantly change our estimates regarding the frequency and timing of claims incurred and the costs to resolve existing and anticipated future claims which would impact the construction defect reserves in the future if the frequency of claims incurred or costs of existing and future legal claims significantly exceed our current estimates they will have a significant negative impact on our future earnings and liquidity 

we estimate and record receivables under the applicable insurance policies related to our estimated contingencies for known claims and anticipated future construction defect claims on previously closed homes and other legal claims and lawsuits incurred in the ordinary course of business when recovery is probable however because the selfinsured retentions under these policies are significant we anticipate we will largely be selfinsured additionally we may have the ability to recover a portion of our losses from our subcontractors and their insurance carriers when we have been named as an additional insured on their insurance policies 

the estimation of losses related to these reserves and the related estimates of recoveries from insurance policies are subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends in construction defect claims relative to our markets and the types of products built claim frequency claim settlement costs and patterns insurance industry practices and legal interpretations among others due to the high degree of judgment required in establishing reserves for these contingencies actual future costs and recoveries from insurance could differ significantly from current estimated amounts a 10 increase in the claim frequency and the average cost per claim used to estimate the reserves would result in an increase of approximately 1017 million in our reserves and a 509 million increase in our receivable resulting in additional expense of 508 million a 10 decrease in the claim frequency and the average cost per claim would result in a decrease of approximately 918 million in our reserves and a 438 million decrease in our receivable resulting in a reduction in expense of 480 million for additional information regarding our legal claims reserves see note l “commitments and contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

pending accounting pronouncements 

in december 2019 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu 201912 related to simplifying the accounting for income taxes the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2021 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in march 2020 the fasb issued asu 202004 “reference rate reform” which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying us gaap to contracts hedging relationships and other transactions affected by the discontinuation of the london interbank offered rate libor or by another reference rate expected to be discontinued the guidance was effective beginning march 12 2020 and can be applied prospectively through december 31 2022 in january 2021 the fasb issued asu 202101 “reference rate reform  scope” which clarified the scope and application of the original guidance we will adopt these standards when libor is discontinued and do not expect them to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures 

in october 2021 the fasb issued asu 202108 which requires application of asc 606 “revenue from contracts with customers” to recognize and measure contract assets and liabilities from contracts with customers acquired in a business combination asu 202108 creates an exception to the general recognition and measurement principle in asc 805 and will result in recognition of contract assets and contract liabilities consistent with those recorded by the acquiree immediately before the acquisition date the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2023 and interim periods therein with early adoption permitted we are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are subject to interest rate risk on our longterm debt we monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and utilize both fixed and variable rate debt for fixed rate debt changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows conversely for variable rate debt changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument but may affect our future earnings and cash flows except in very limited circumstances we do not have an obligation to prepay fixedrate debt prior to maturity and as a result interest rate risk and changes in fair value would not have a significant impact on our cash flows related to our fixedrate debt until such time as we are required to refinance repurchase or repay such debt 

we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with our mortgage loan origination services we manage interest rate risk through the use of forward sales of mbs which are referred to as “hedging instruments” in the following discussion we do not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate lock commitments irlcs are extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and who meet defined credit and underwriting criteria typically the irlcs have a duration of less than six months some irlcs are committed immediately to a specific purchaser through the use of bestefforts whole loan delivery commitments while other irlcs are funded prior to being committed to thirdparty purchasers the hedging instruments related to irlcs are classified and accounted for as derivative instruments in an economic hedge with gains and losses recognized in revenues in the consolidated statements of operations hedging instruments related to funded uncommitted loans are accounted for at fair value with changes recognized in revenues in the consolidated statements of operations along with changes in the fair value of the funded uncommitted loans the fair value change related to the hedging instruments generally offsets the fair value change in the uncommitted loans the net fair value change which for the years ended september 30 2021 and 2020 was not significant is recognized in current earnings at september 30 2021 hedging instruments used to mitigate interest rate risk related to uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale and uncommitted irlcs totaled a notional amount of 27 billion uncommitted irlcs totaled a notional amount of approximately 14 billion and uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale totaled a notional amount of approximately 13 billion at september 30 2021 

we also use hedging instruments as part of a program to offer below market interest rate financing to our homebuyers at september 30 2021 and 2020 we had mbs totaling 8346 million and 11 billion respectively that did not yet have irlcs or closed loans created or assigned and recorded an asset of 11 million at september 30 2021 and a liability of 53 million at september 30 2020 for the fair value of such mbs position 

the following table sets forth principal cash flows by scheduled maturity effective weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value of our debt obligations as of september 30 2021 because the mortgage repurchase facility is effectively secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale that are typically sold within 60 days its outstanding balance is included in the most current period presented the interest rate for our variable rate debt represents the weighted average interest rate in effect at september 30 2021

our business operations consist of homebuilding a majorityowned residential lot development company financial services and other activities our homebuilding operations are our core business generating 97 of our consolidated revenues of 203 billion 176 billion and 161 billion in fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively our homebuilding operations generate most of their revenues from the sale of completed homes and to a lesser extent from the sale of land and lots approximately 91 of our home sales revenue in fiscal 2020 was generated from the sale of singlefamily detached homes with the remainder from the sale of attached homes such as townhomes duplexes and triplexes 

our position as the most geographically diverse and largest volume homebuilder in the united states provides a strong platform for us to compete for new home sales in recent years we have expanded our product offerings to include a broad range of homes for entrylevel moveup active adult and luxury buyers across our markets our entrylevel homes at affordable price points have experienced very strong demand from homebuyers as the entrylevel segment of the new home market remains underserved with low inventory levels relative to demand

operating structure and processes 

following is an overview of our company’s operating structure and the significant processes that support our business controls strategies and performance 

homebuilding markets 

our homebuilding business operates in 88 markets across 29 states which provides us with geographic diversification in our homebuilding inventory investments and our sources of revenues and earnings we believe our geographic diversification lowers our operational risks by mitigating the effects of local and regional economic cycles and it also enhances our earnings potential by providing more diverse opportunities to invest in our business 

we conduct our homebuilding operations in the geographic regions states and markets listed below and we conduct our financial services operations in many of these markets our homebuilding operating divisions are aggregated into six reporting segments also referred to as reporting regions which comprise the markets below our financial statements and the notes thereto contain additional information regarding segment performance 



when evaluating new or existing homebuilding markets for purposes of capital allocation we consider local marketspecific factors including among others 

• economic conditions 

• employment levels and job growth 

• income level of potential homebuyers 

• local housing affordability and typical mortgage products utilized 

• market for homes at our targeted price points 

• availability of land and lots in desirable locations on acceptable terms 

• land entitlement and development processes 

• availability of qualified subcontractors 

• new and secondary home sales activity 

• competition 

• prevailing housing products features cost and pricing and 

• performance capabilities of our local management team 

economies of scale 

we are the largest homebuilding company in the united states in fiscal 2020 as measured by number of homes closed and we are also one of the largest builders in most of the markets in which we operate we believe that our national regional and local scale of operations provides us with benefits that may not be available to the same degree to some other smaller homebuilders such as 

• greater access to and lower cost of capital due to our balance sheet strength and our lending and capital markets relationships 

• volume discounts and rebates from national regional and local materials suppliers and lower labor rates from certain subcontractors and 

• enhanced leverage of our general and administrative activities which allows us flexibility to adjust to changes in market conditions and compete effectively across our markets 

decentralized homebuilding operations 

we view homebuilding as a local business therefore most of our direct homebuilding activities are decentralized to provide flexibility to our local managers in making operational decisions we believe that our local management teams who are familiar with local market conditions have the best information to make many decisions regarding their operations at september 30 2020 we had 53 separate homebuilding operating divisions many of which operate in more than one market area generally each operating division consists of a division president a controller and accounting personnel land entitlement acquisition and development personnel a sales manager and sales and marketing personnel a construction manager and construction superintendents customer service personnel a purchasing manager and office staff our division presidents receive performancebased compensation if they achieve targeted financial and operating metrics related to their operating divisions following is a summary of our homebuilding activities that are decentralized in our local operating divisions and the control and oversight functions that are centralized in our regional and corporate offices 

operating division responsibilities 

each operating division is responsible for 

• site selection which involves 

— a feasibility study 

— soil and environmental reviews 

— review of existing zoning and other governmental requirements 

— review of the need for and extent of offsite work required to obtain project entitlements and 

— financial analysis of the potential project

• developing and implementing local marketing and sales plans

centralized controls 

we centralize many important risk elements of our homebuilding business through our regional and corporate offices we have five separate homebuilding regional offices generally each regional office consists of a region president a chief financial officer legal counsel and other operational and office support staff each of our region presidents and their management teams are responsible for oversight of the operations of a number of homebuilding operating divisions including 

• review and approval of division business plans and budgets

• review of all business and financial analysis for potential land and lot inventory investments 

• oversight of land and home inventory levels 

• monitoring division financial and operating performance and

our corporate executives and corporate office departments are responsible for establishing our operational policies and internal control standards and for monitoring compliance with established policies and controls throughout our operations the corporate office also has primary responsibility for direct management of certain key risk elements and initiatives through the following centralized functions

landlot acquisition and inventory management 

we acquire land for use in our homebuilding and forestar operations after we have completed due diligence and generally after we have obtained the rights known as entitlements to begin development or construction work resulting in an acceptable number of residential lots before we acquire lots or tracts of land we complete a feasibility study which includes soil tests independent environmental studies other engineering work and financial analysis we also evaluate the status of necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements required to develop and use the property for home construction although we purchase and develop land primarily to support our homebuilding activities we may sell land and lots to other developers and homebuilders where we have excess land and lot positions or for other strategic reasons 

we also enter into landlot contracts in which we obtain the right but generally not the obligation to buy land or lots at predetermined prices on a defined schedule commensurate with anticipated home closings or planned development these contracts generally are nonrecourse which limits our financial exposure to our earnest money deposited into escrow under the terms of the contract and any preacquisition due diligence costs we incur this enables us to control land and lot positions with limited capital investment which substantially reduces the risks associated with land ownership 

we directly acquire almost all of our land and lot positions we are a party to a small number of joint ventures joint ventures are consolidated if we have a controlling interest or accounted for under the equity method of accounting if we have a significant influence but not control 

we attempt to mitigate our exposure to real estate inventory risks by 

• controlling our level of inventory investment and managing our supply of landlots owned and controlled under purchase contracts to match the expected housing demand in each of our operating markets 

• monitoring local market and demographic trends housing preferences and related economic developments including the identification of desirable housing submarkets based on the quality of local schools new job opportunities local growth initiatives and personal income trends 

• utilizing landlot purchase contracts and seeking to acquire developed lots which are substantially ready for home construction where possible and 

• monitoring and managing the number of speculative homes homes under construction without an executed sales contract built in each subdivision 

land development and home construction 

substantially all of our land development and home construction work is performed by subcontractors subcontractors typically are selected after a competitive bidding process and are retained for a specific subdivision or series of house plans pursuant to a contract that obligates the subcontractor to complete the scope of work at an agreedupon price we employ land development managers and construction superintendents to monitor land development and home construction activities participate in major design and building decisions coordinate the activities of subcontractors and suppliers review the work of subcontractors for quality and cost controls and monitor compliance with zoning and building codes in addition our construction superintendents interact with our homebuyers during the construction process and instruct buyers on postclosing home maintenance 

our home designs are selected or prepared in each of our markets to appeal to local homebuyers’ expectations for affordability home size and features and our local management teams adjust product offerings to meet buyer demand as necessary in many communities we offer optional interior and exterior features to homebuyers for an additional charge construction time for our homes depends on the availability of labor materials and supplies the weather the size of the home and other factors we complete the construction of most homes within two to six months 

we typically do not maintain significant inventories of land development or construction materials except for work in progress materials for active development projects and homes under construction generally the construction materials used in our operations are readily available from numerous sources we have contracts exceeding one year with certain suppliers of building materials that are cancelable at our option 

we are subject to governmental regulations that affect our land development and construction operations at times we have experienced delays in receiving the proper approvals from municipalities or other government agencies that have delayed our anticipated development and construction activities in certain communities 

cost controls 

we control construction costs by designing our homes efficiently and by obtaining competitive bids for construction materials and labor we also competitively bid and negotiate pricing from our subcontractors and suppliers based on the volume of services and products we purchase on a local regional and national basis we monitor our land development expenditures and construction costs versus budgets for each house and community and we review our inventory levels margins expenses profitability and returns for each operating market compared to both its business plan and our performance expectations 

we control overhead costs by centralizing certain accounting and administrative functions monitoring staffing and compensation levels and by applying technology to business processes to improve productivity where practical we review other general and administrative costs to identify efficiencies and savings opportunities in our operating divisions and our regional and corporate offices we also direct many of our promotional activities toward local real estate brokers and digital marketing initiatives which we believe are efficient uses of our marketing expenditures 

marketing and sales 

we primarily use the dr horton emerald homes express homes and freedom homes brand names to market and sell our homes our dr horton branded communities are the core of our business and account for the majority of our home closings focusing primarily on the first time and first time moveup homebuyer our emerald branded communities appeal to buyers in search of higherend moveup and luxury homes our express branded communities primarily accommodate a segment of entrylevel buyers who are focused on affordability our freedom homes brand offers homes at affordable price points to active adult buyers seeking a lowmaintenance lifestyle the percentage of home closings and home sales revenue contributed by each brand during fiscal 2020 was as follows 



we also use names of acquired companies for a period of time after the acquisition we currently utilize the pacific ridge homes brand in our seattle washington market the lexington homes brand in our spokane washington market and the terramor homes brand in our raleigh north carolina market the product offerings in all of these markets are similar to and included with our dr horton branded communities shown above 

we market and sell our homes primarily through commissioned employees and the majority of our home closings also involve an independent real estate broker we typically conduct home sales from sales offices located in furnished model homes in each subdivision and we generally do not offer our model homes for sale until the completion of a subdivision our sales personnel assist prospective homebuyers by providing floor plans and price information demonstrating the features and layouts of our homes and assisting with the selection of options when available we train and inform our sales personnel regarding construction schedules and marketing and advertising plans as market conditions warrant we may provide potential homebuyers with incentives such as discounts or free upgrades to be competitive in a particular market or to attain our targeted sales pace 

we market our homes and communities to prospective homebuyers and real estate brokers digitally through email search engine marketing social media and our company website and other real estate websites in addition to print media and advertisement we also use billboards radio television magazine and newspaper advertising locally as necessary we attempt to position our subdivisions in locations that are desirable to potential homebuyers and convenient to or visible from local traffic patterns which helps to reduce advertising costs model homes play an important role in our marketing efforts and we expend significant effort and resources to create an attractive atmosphere in our model homes 

we also build speculative homes in most of our communities which allow us to compete effectively with existing homes available in the market and improve our profits and returns these homes enhance our marketing and sales efforts to prospective homebuyers who are renters or who are relocating to these markets and require a home within a short time frame as well as to independent brokers who represent these homebuyers we determine our speculative homes strategy in each market based on local market factors such as new job growth the number of job relocations housing demand and supply seasonality current sales contract cancellation trends and our past experience in the market we maintain a level of speculative home inventory in each community based on our current and planned sales pace and we monitor and adjust speculative home inventory on an ongoing basis as conditions warrant 

sales contracts and backlog 

our sales contracts require an earnest money deposit which varies in amount across our markets and communities additionally customers are generally required to pay additional deposits when they select options or upgrade features for their homes our sales contracts include a financing contingency which permits customers to cancel and receive a refund of their deposit if they cannot obtain mortgage financing at prevailing or specified interest rates within a specified period our contracts may include other contingencies such as the sale of an existing home we either retain or refund customer deposits on cancelled sales contracts depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances 

sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period at september 30 2020 the value of our backlog of sales orders was 82 billion 26683 homes an increase of 98 from 41 billion 13613 homes at september 30 2019 the average sales price of homes in backlog was 306800 at september 30 2020 up slightly from the 304100 average at september 30 2019 many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies such as those described above which can result in cancellations as a percentage of gross sales orders cancellations of sales contracts were 20 in fiscal 2020 compared to 21 in fiscal 2019 

the length of time between the signing of a sales contract for a home and delivery of the home to the buyer closing is generally from one to six months therefore substantially all of the homes in our sales backlog at september 30 2020 are scheduled to close in fiscal 2021 

customer service and quality control 

our operating divisions are responsible for preclosing quality control inspections and responding to customers’ postclosing needs we believe that a prompt and courteous response to homebuyers’ needs during and after construction reduces postclosing repair costs enhances our reputation for quality and service and ultimately leads to repeat and referral business from the real estate community and homebuyers we typically provide our homebuyers with a tenyear limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems a twoyear limited warranty on major mechanical systems and a oneyear limited warranty on other construction components the subcontractors who perform the actual construction also provide us with warranties on workmanship and are generally prepared to respond to us and the homeowner promptly upon request in addition some of our suppliers provide manufacturer’s warranties on specified products installed in the home 

singlefamily rental properties 

during fiscal 2020 several of our homebuilding divisions began constructing and leasing homes as singlefamily rental properties after these rental properties are constructed and achieve a stabilized level of leased occupancy the properties in each community are expected to be marketed in bulk for sale at september 30 2020 our homebuilding fixed assets included 872 million of assets related to our singlefamily rental platform representing approximately 740 singlefamily rental homes and finished lots including approximately 440 completed homes there were no bulk sales of singlefamily rental properties in fiscal 2020 

forestar residential lot development operations 

during fiscal 2018 we acquired 75 of the outstanding shares of forestar forestar is a residential lot development company with operations in 49 markets across 21 states as of september 30 2020 we owned approximately 65 of forestar’s outstanding common stock at september 30 2020 forestar is a component of our homebuilding strategy to enhance operational efficiency and returns by expanding relationships with land developers and increasing the portion of our land and lot position controlled under land purchase contracts forestar’s strategy is focused on making investments in land acquisition and development to expand its residential lot development business across a geographically diversified national platform and consolidating market share in the fragmented us lot development industry our homebuilding operations acquire finished lots from forestar in accordance with the master supply agreement between the two companies a shared services agreement is in place whereby we provide forestar certain administrative compliance operational and procurement services as the controlling shareholder of forestar we have significant influence in guiding the strategic direction and operations of forestar 

customer mortgage financing 

we provide mortgage financing services principally to purchasers of our homes in the majority of our homebuilding markets through dhi mortgage our 100 owned subsidiary dhi mortgage assists in the sales transaction by coordinating the mortgage application mortgage commitment and home closing processes to facilitate a timely and efficient home buying experience for our buyers during the year ended september 30 2020 dhi mortgage provided mortgage financing services for approximately 68 of our total homes closed and approximately 97 of dhi mortgage’s loan volume related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations most of our homebuilding divisions also work with additional mortgage lenders that offer a range of mortgage financing programs to our homebuyers 

to limit the risks associated with our mortgage operations dhi mortgage originates loan products that we believe can be sold to thirdparty purchasers of mortgage loans the majority of which are eligible for sale to the federal national mortgage association fannie mae the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac or the government national mortgage association ginnie mae dhi mortgage sells substantially all of the loans and the majority of the related servicing rights to thirdparty purchasers shortly after origination with limited recourse provisions dhi mortgage centralizes most of its control and oversight functions including those related to loan underwriting quality control regulatory compliance secondary marketing of loans hedging activities accounting and financial reporting 

title services 

through our subsidiary title companies we serve as a title insurance agent in selected markets by providing title insurance policies examination and closing services primarily to our homebuilding customers

human capital resources 

as of september 30 2020 we employ 9716 people of whom 6818 work in our homebuilding operations 2163 in our financial services segment 463 at our corporate office 143 for our forestar subsidiary and 129 in our other businesses of our homebuilding employees 2666 are involved in construction 1996 are sales and marketing personnel and 2156 are office personnel 

we believe the people who work for our company are our most important resources and are critical to our continued success we focus significant attention toward attracting and retaining talented and experienced individuals to manage and support our operations we offer our employees a broad range of companypaid benefits and we believe our compensation package and benefits are competitive with others in our industry additional information about our employee benefit plans is included in note k 

our management team supports a culture of developing future leaders from our existing workforce enabling us to promote from within for many leadership positions we believe this provides longterm focus and continuity to our operations while also providing opportunities for the growth and advancement of our employees our focus on retention is evident in the length of service of our executive regional and divisional management teams the average tenure of our executive team and homebuilding region presidents is 27 years and the average tenure of our homebuilding division presidents and city managers is greater than 10 years 

we are committed to hiring developing and supporting a diverse and inclusive workplace our management teams are expected to exhibit and promote honest ethical and respectful conduct in the workplace all of our employees must adhere to a code of conduct that sets standards for appropriate behavior and includes required internal training on preventing identifying reporting and stopping any type of discrimination 

during fiscal 2020 despite the covid19 pandemic c19 we increased the number of employees in all of our operating segments and kept all of our employee compensation and benefit plans intact we have implemented safety protocols to protect our employees and our homebuyers during the pandemic these protocols include complying with social distancing and other health and safety standards as required by federal state and local government agencies taking into consideration guidelines of the centers for disease control and prevention and other public health authorities many of our administrative and operational functions during this time have required modification including some of our workforce working remotely our experienced teams of people adapted to the changes in our work environment and have managed our business successfully during this challenging time 

business acquisitions 

we routinely evaluate opportunities to profitably expand our operations including potential acquisitions of other homebuilding or related businesses acquisitions of homebuilding and related businesses usually provide us with immediate land and home inventories and control of additional land and lot positions through purchase contracts also employees of acquired businesses generally have specialized knowledge of local market conditions including existing relationships with municipalities land owners developers subcontractors and suppliers these inventory positions and local market knowledge and relationships could take us several years to develop through our own efforts we seek to limit the risks associated with acquiring other companies by conducting extensive operational financial and legal due diligence on each acquisition and by performing financial analysis to determine that each acquisition will have a positive impact on our earnings within an acceptable period of time 

competition 

the homebuilding and lot development industries are highly competitive we compete with numerous other national regional and local homebuilders and developers for homebuyers desirable land raw materials skilled labor employees management talent and financing we also compete with resales of existing and foreclosed homes and with the rental housing market our homes compete on the basis of price location quality design and mortgage financing terms 

the competitors to our financial services businesses include other mortgage lenders and title companies including national regional and local mortgage bankers and other financial institutions some of these competitors are subject to fewer governmental regulations and may have greater access to capital and some of them may operate with different lending criteria and may offer a broader array of financing and other products and services to consumers than we do we strive to provide flexible fairly priced financing alternatives subject to applicable regulations 

governmental regulations and environmental matters 

the homebuilding industry is subject to extensive and complex regulations we and the subcontractors we use must comply with many federal state and local laws and regulations these include zoning density and development requirements and building environmental advertising labor and real estate sales rules and regulations these regulations and requirements affect substantially all aspects of our land development and home design construction and sales processes in varying degrees across our markets our homes are inspected by local authorities where required and homes eligible for insurance or guarantees provided by the federal housing administration fha and the us department of veteran affairs va are subject to inspection by them these regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities in addition our new housing developments may be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets utilities and other public improvements 

our homebuilding and land development operations are also subject to an extensive array of local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning protection of health safety and the environment the particular compliance requirements for each site vary greatly according to location environmental condition and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties 

our mortgage company must comply with extensive state and federal laws and regulations which are administered by numerous agencies including but not limited to the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb federal housing finance agency us department of housing and urban development fha va united states department of agriculture usda fannie mae freddie mac and ginnie mae these laws and regulations include many compliance requirements including but not limited to licensing consumer disclosures fair lending and real estate settlement procedures as a result our operations are subject to regular extensive examinations by the applicable agencies 

seasonality 

although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again in the future we generally close more homes and generate greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year the seasonal nature of our business can also cause significant variations in our working capital requirements in our homebuilding lot development and financial services operations as a result of seasonal activity our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year 




 item 1a risk factors 

discussion of our business and operations included in this annual report on form 10k should be read together with the risk factors set forth below they describe various risks and uncertainties we are or may become subject to many of which are difficult to predict or beyond our control these risks and uncertainties together with other factors described elsewhere in this report have the potential to affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner 

risks related to our business and our industry 

public health issues such as a major epidemic or pandemic could adversely affect our business or financial results 

the us and other countries have experienced and may experience in the future outbreaks of contagious diseases that affect public health and public perception of health risk in december 2019 c19 emerged in the wuhan region of china and subsequently spread worldwide the world health organization declared c19 a pandemic resulting in federal state and local governments and private entities mandating various restrictions requiring closure of nonessential businesses for a period of time in almost all of the municipalities across the us where we operate residential construction and financial services have been deemed essential businesses as part of critical infrastructure and we have continued our homebuilding lot development and financial services operations in those markets where allowed we implemented operational protocols to comply with social distancing and other health and safety standards as required by federal state and local government agencies taking into consideration guidelines of the centers for disease control and prevention and other public health authorities 

our results of operations are affected by economic conditions including macroeconomic conditions and levels of business confidence and consumer confidence there is significant uncertainty regarding the extent to which and how long c19 and its related effects will impact the us economy and level of employment capital markets secondary mortgage markets consumer confidence demand for our homes and availability of mortgage loans to homebuyers the extent to which c19 impacts our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments including the duration and spread of c19 and the impact on our customers trade partners and employees all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted if c19 has a significant negative impact on economic conditions over a prolonged period of time our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted 

the homebuilding and lot development industries are cyclical and affected by changes in economic real estate or other conditions that could adversely affect our business or financial results 

the homebuilding and lot development industries are cyclical and are significantly affected by changes in general and local economic and real estate conditions such as 

• employment levels 

• consumer confidence and spending 

• housing demand 

• availability of financing for homebuyers 

• interest rates 

• availability and prices of new homes for sale and alternatives to new homes including foreclosed homes homes held for sale by investors and speculators other existing homes and rental properties and 

• demographic trends 

adverse changes in these general and local economic conditions or deterioration in the broader economy would cause a negative impact on our business and financial results and increase the risk for asset impairments and writeoffs changes in these economic conditions may affect some of our regions or markets more than others if adverse conditions affect our larger markets they could have a proportionately greater impact on us than on some other homebuilding companies 

in the past the federal government’s fiscal and trade policies and economic stimulus actions have created uncertainty in the financial markets and caused volatility in interest rates which impacted business and consumer behavior monetary policy actions affecting interest rates or fiscal policy actions and new legislation related to taxation spending levels or borrowing limits along with the related political debates conflicts and compromises associated with such actions may negatively impact the financial markets and consumer confidence such events could hurt the us economy and the housing market and in turn could adversely affect the operating results of our businesses 

weather conditions and natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes volcanic activity droughts and floods heavy or prolonged precipitation or wildfires can harm our business these can delay our development work home construction and home closings adversely affect the cost or availability of materials or labor or damage homes under construction the climates and geology of many of the states in which we operate including california florida texas and other coastal areas where we have some of our larger operations and which have experienced recent natural disasters present increased risks of adverse weather or natural disasters 

deployments of us military personnel to foreign regions terrorist attacks other acts of violence or threats to national security and any corresponding response by the united states or others domestic or international instability or civil unrest may cause an economic slowdown in the markets where we operate which could adversely affect our business 

if we experience any of the foregoing potential customers may be less willing or able to buy our homes in the future our pricing and product strategies may also be limited by market conditions we may be unable to change the mix of our home offerings reduce the costs of the homes we build offer more affordable homes or satisfactorily address changing market conditions in other ways without adversely affecting our profits and returns in addition cancellations of home sales contracts in backlog may increase if homebuyers do not honor their contracts due to any of the factors discussed above 

our financial services business is closely related to our homebuilding business as it originates mortgage loans principally to purchasers of the homes we build a decrease in the demand for our homes because of the foregoing matters will also adversely affect the financial results of this segment of our business an increase in the default rate on the mortgages we originate may adversely affect our ability to sell the mortgages or the pricing we receive upon the sale of mortgages or may increase our recourse obligations for previous originations we may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to thirdparty purchasers in the event of errors or omissions relating to certain representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the type of collateral the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in the connection with the loan and we may be required to repurchase certain of those mortgage loans or provide indemnification repurchased mortgage loans andor the settlement of claims associated with such loans could adversely affect our business or financial results we establish reserves for estimated losses and future repurchase obligations for mortgage loans we have sold however actual future obligations related to these mortgages could differ significantly from our current estimated amounts 

constriction of the credit and public capital markets could limit our ability to access capital and increase our costs of capital 

during past economic and housing downturns the credit markets constricted and reduced some sources of liquidity that were previously available to us consequently we relied principally on our cash on hand to meet our working capital needs and repay outstanding indebtedness during those times there likely will be periods in the future when financial market upheaval will increase our cost of capital or limit our ability to access the public debt markets or obtain bank financing 

our homebuilding operations utilize a 159 billion 5year senior unsecured revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to 25 billion subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments our 5year homebuilding revolving credit facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit equal to 100 of the revolving credit commitment the maturity date of the 5year facility is october 2 2024 we also have a 375 million 364day senior unsecured homebuilding revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to 550 million subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments the maturity date of the 364day facility is may 27 2021 forestar and its subsidiaries our financial services subsidiaries and certain of our other subsidiaries are not guarantors under our homebuilding revolving credit facilities or our homebuilding senior notes 

forestar has a 380 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to 570 million subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments the forestar revolving credit facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit equal to the greater of 100 million and 50 of the revolving credit commitment the maturity date of the facility is october 2 2022 the forestar revolving credit facility is guaranteed by forestar’s whollyowned subsidiaries that are not immaterial subsidiaries or have not been designated as unrestricted subsidiaries the forestar revolving credit facility is not guaranteed by us or our other subsidiaries 

our mortgage subsidiary utilizes a 135 billion mortgage repurchase facility to finance the majority of the loans it originates the capacity of the facility increased without requiring additional commitments to 1575 billion for approximately 45 days around september 30 2020 and increases again for approximately 30 days around december 31 2020 the capacity can also be increased to 18 billion subject to the availability of additional commitments the mortgage repurchase facility must be renewed annually and currently expires on february 19 2021 we expect to renew and extend the term of the mortgage repurchase facility with similar terms prior to its maturity adverse changes in market conditions could make the renewal of these facilities more difficult or could result in an increase in the cost of these facilities or a decrease in the committed amounts such changes affecting our mortgage repurchase facility may also make it more difficult or costly to sell the mortgages that we originate 

we regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund growth in our business repay debt obligations pay dividends repurchase our common stock and support other general corporate and operational needs and we regularly evaluate our opportunities to raise additional capital dr horton has an automatically effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec in august 2018 registering debt and equity securities that may be issued from time to time in amounts to be determined forestar also has an effective shelf registration statement filed with the sec in september 2018 registering 500 million of equity securities at september 30 2020 3943 million remained available and 100 million of this availability is reserved for sales under forestar’s atthemarket equity offering program established in august 2020 as market conditions permit we may issue new debt or equity securities through the capital markets or obtain additional bank financing to fund our projected capital requirements or provide additional liquidity we believe that our existing cash resources revolving credit facilities mortgage repurchase facility and ability to access the capital markets or obtain additional financing will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our nearterm working capital needs and debt obligations including the maturity of 400 million aggregate principal amount of our homebuilding senior notes in fiscal 2021 adverse changes in economic homebuilding or capital market conditions due to c19 or otherwise could negatively affect our business liquidity and financial results restrict our ability to obtain additional capital or increase our costs of capital 

reductions in the availability of mortgage financing provided by government agencies changes in government financing programs a decrease in our ability to sell mortgage loans on attractive terms or an increase in mortgage interest rates could decrease our buyers’ ability to obtain financing and adversely affect our business or financial results 

the mortgage loans originated by our financial services operations are primarily eligible for sale to fannie mae freddie mac or ginnie mae and are typically sold to thirdparty purchasers the secondary market for mortgage loans continues to primarily desire securities backed by fannie mae freddie mac or ginnie mae and we believe the liquidity these agencies provide to the mortgage industry is important to the housing market any significant change regarding the longterm structure and viability of fannie mae and freddie mac could result in adjustments to the size of their loan portfolios and to guidelines for their loan products additionally a reduction in the availability of financing provided by these institutions could adversely affect interest rates mortgage availability and sales of new homes and mortgage loans during fiscal 2020 approximately 66 of our mortgage loans were sold directly to fannie mae or into securities backed by ginnie mae and 28 were sold to two other major financial entities on an ongoing basis we seek to establish loan purchase arrangements with additional financial entities if we are unable to sell mortgage loans to purchasers on attractive terms our ability to originate and sell mortgage loans at competitive prices could be limited which would negatively affect our profitability 

the fha insures mortgage loans that generally have lower credit requirements and is an important source for financing the sale of our homes changes restrictions or significant premium increases in fha programs in the future may negatively affect the availability or affordability of fha financing which could adversely affect our ability to sell homes 

some of our customers may qualify for 100 financing through programs offered by the va and the usda and certain other housing finance agencies these programs are subject to changes in regulations lending standards and government funding levels there can be no assurances that these programs or other programs will continue to be available in our homebuilding markets or that they will be as attractive to our customers as the programs currently offered which could negatively affect our sales 

mortgage rates are currently low compared to most historical periods however market conditions could change causing mortgage rates to rise in the future when interest rates increase the cost of owning a home increases which will likely reduce the number of potential homebuyers who can obtain mortgage financing and could result in a decline in the demand for our homes 

in the latter part of fiscal 2020 due to reduced liquidity in the secondary market related to remedies provided in the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act to borrowers of residential loans we began retaining mortgage servicing rights on some of our originations as servicer for these loans we may have to advance payments to the mortgagebacked securities mbs bondholders to the extent there are insufficient collections to satisfy the required principal and interest remittances of the underlying mortgagebacked securities 

the risks associated with our land and lot inventory could adversely affect our business or financial results 

inventory risks are substantial for our homebuilding and forestar businesses there are risks inherent in controlling owning and developing land if housing demand declines we may not be able to build and sell homes profitably in some of our communities and we may not be able to fully recover the costs of some of the land and lots we own also the values of our owned undeveloped land lots and housing inventories may fluctuate significantly due to changes in market conditions as a result our deposits for lots controlled under purchase contracts may be put at risk we may have to sell homes or land for a lower profit margin or record inventory impairment charges on our land and lots a significant deterioration in economic or homebuilding industry conditions may result in substantial inventory impairment charges 

we cannot make any assurances that our growth strategies acquisitions or investments will be successful or will not expose us to additional risks or other negative consequences 

in recent years we have primarily grown our business by increasing our investments in land lot and home inventories in our existing homebuilding markets we have also expanded through investments in new product offerings new geographic markets and the growth of our multifamily rental property operations investments in land lots home inventories and rental properties can expose us to risks of economic loss and asset impairments if housing conditions weaken or if we are unsuccessful in implementing our growth strategies 

in october 2017 we acquired 75 of the outstanding shares of forestar and at september 30 2020 we owned 65 of its outstanding shares forestar is a publicly traded residential lot development company with operations in 49 markets across 21 states as of september 30 2020 forestar’s strategy is focused on making significant investments in land acquisition and development to expand its residential lot development business across a geographically diversified national platform and consolidating market share in the fragmented us lot development industry our homebuilding divisions acquire finished lots from forestar in accordance with the master supply agreement between the two companies and we provide forestar certain administrative compliance operational and procurement services through a shared services agreement as the controlling shareholder of forestar we strongly influence the strategic direction and operations of forestar 

in addition to the investment and merger with forestar we have acquired the homebuilding operations of several homebuilding companies in recent years and we may make strategic acquisitions of or investments in other companies operations or assets in the future such acquisitions and investments may have risks similar to those related to land lots and home inventories but they may also expose us to additional risks or other negative consequences these transactions may not advance our business strategy provide a satisfactory return on our investment or provide other benefits we anticipate also the integration of these transactions may not be successful and may require significant time and resources which may divert management’s attention from other operations acquisitions and investments could also expose us to material liabilities not discovered in the due diligence process and may lead to litigation if these transactions underperform our expectations or are unsuccessful we may incur significant expenses or writeoffs of inventory other assets or intangible assets such as goodwill acquisitions and investments can result in dilution to existing stockholders if we issue our common stock as consideration and can increase our debt levels or reduce our liquidity if we purchase them with cash the magnitude timing and nature of any future acquisitions or investments will depend on a number of factors including our ability to identify suitable additional markets or acquisition candidates the negotiation of acceptable terms our financial position and general economic and business conditions we also may seek to divest an investment or a business and may have difficulty selling such investment or business on acceptable terms in a timely manner 

our business and financial results could be adversely affected by significant inflation higher interest rates or deflation 

inflation can adversely affect us by increasing costs of land materials and labor in addition significant inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates which have a negative impact on housing affordability in a highly inflationary environment depending on industry and other economic conditions we may be precluded from raising home prices enough to keep up with the rate of inflation which could reduce our profit margins moreover in a highly inflationary environment our cost of capital labor and materials can increase and the purchasing power of our cash resources can decline which could have an adverse impact on our business or financial results 

alternatively a significant period of deflation could cause a decrease in overall spending and borrowing levels this could lead to deterioration in economic conditions including an increase in the rate of unemployment deflation could also cause the value of our inventories to decline or reduce the value of existing homes below the related mortgage loan balance which could potentially increase the supply of existing homes if oil prices decline significantly economic conditions in markets that have significant exposure to the energy sector may weaken these or other factors that increase the risk of significant deflation could have a negative impact on our business or financial results 

homebuilding is subject to home warranty and construction defect claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant 

we are subject to home warranty and construction defect claims arising in the ordinary course of our homebuilding business we rely on subcontractors to perform the actual construction of our homes and in many cases to select and obtain construction materials despite our detailed specifications and monitoring of the construction process our subcontractors occasionally do not meet adequate quality standards in the construction of our homes when we find these issues we repair them in accordance with our warranty obligations we spend significant resources to repair items in homes we have sold to fulfill the warranties we issued to our homebuyers additionally we are subject to construction defect claims which can be costly to defend and resolve in the legal system warranty and construction defect matters can also result in negative publicity in the media and on the internet which can damage our reputation and adversely affect our ability to sell homes 

based on the large number of homes we have sold over the years our potential liabilities related to warranty and construction defect claims are significant as a consequence we maintain product liability insurance and we seek to obtain indemnities and certificates of insurance from subcontractors covering claims related to their workmanship and materials we establish warranty and other reserves for the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built because of the uncertainties inherent to these matters we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will be adequate to address all of our future warranty and construction defect claims contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce we may be responsible for applicable selfinsured retentions and some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits additionally the coverage offered by and the availability of product liability insurance for construction defects is limited and costly we have responded to increases in insurance costs and coverage limitations by increasing our selfinsured retentions and claim reserves there can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted or become more costly if costs to resolve our future warranty and construction defect claims exceed our estimates our financial results and liquidity could be adversely affected 

a health and safety incident relating to our operations could be costly in terms of potential liability and reputational damage 

  

building and land development sites are inherently dangerous and operating in the homebuilding and lot development industries poses certain inherent health and safety risks due to health and safety regulatory requirements and the number of homes we construct health and safety performance is critical to the success of our business any failure in health and safety performance may result in penalties for noncompliance with relevant regulatory requirements and a failure that results in a major or significant health and safety incident is likely to be costly and could expose us to liability that could be costly such an incident could generate significant negative publicity and have a corresponding impact on our reputation our relationships with relevant regulatory agencies or governmental authorities and our ability to attract customers and employees which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and liquidity 

supply shortages and other risks related to acquiring land building materials and skilled labor could increase our costs and delay deliveries 

the homebuilding and lot development industries have from time to time experienced significant difficulties that can affect the cost or timing of construction including 

• difficulty in acquiring land suitable for residential building at affordable prices in locations where our potential customers want to live 

• shortages of qualified subcontractors 

• reliance on local subcontractors manufacturers distributors and land developers who may be inadequately capitalized 

• shortages of materials and 

• significant increases in the cost of materials particularly increases in the price of lumber drywall and cement which are significant components of home construction costs 

in addition tariffs duties andor trade restrictions imposed or increased on imported materials and goods that are used in connection with the construction and delivery of our homes including steel aluminum and lumber may raise our costs for these items or for the products made with them these factors may cause construction delays or cause us to incur more costs building our homes if the level of new home demand increases significantly in future periods the risk of shortages and cost increases in residential lots labor and materials available to the homebuilding industry will likely increase 

we are required to obtain performance bonds the unavailability of which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

we often are required to provide surety bonds to secure our performance or obligations under construction contracts development agreements and other arrangements at september 30 2020 we had 18 billion of outstanding surety bonds our ability to obtain surety bonds primarily depends upon our credit rating financial condition past performance and other factors including the capacity of the surety market and the underwriting practices of surety bond issuers the ability to obtain surety bonds also can be impacted by the willingness of insurance companies to issue performance bonds for construction and development activities if we are unable to obtain surety bonds when required our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

increases in the costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business or financial results 

significant expenses of owning a home including mortgage loan interest and state and local income and property taxes have historically been deductible expenses for an individual’s federal income taxes subject to various limitations the tax cuts and jobs act which became effective january 1 2018 established new limits on these federal tax deductions that could reduce the actual or perceived affordability of homeownership these or any further changes in income tax laws by the federal or state government to eliminate or substantially reduce income tax benefits associated with homeownership could adversely affect demand for and sales prices of new homes especially in areas with relatively high housing prices or high taxes 

in addition increases in property tax rates by local governmental authorities as experienced in some areas in response to reduced federal and state funding could adversely affect the amount of financing our potential customers could obtain or their desire to purchase new homes 

governmental regulations and environmental matters could increase the cost and limit the availability of our land development and homebuilding projects and adversely affect our business or financial results 

we are subject to extensive and complex regulations that affect land development and home construction including zoning density restrictions building design and building standards these regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities as to the conditions we must meet prior to development or construction being approved if approved at all we are subject to determinations by these authorities as to the adequacy of water or sewage facilities roads or other local services new housing developments may also be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets and other public improvements in addition in many markets government authorities have implemented no growth or growth control initiatives any of these may limit delay or increase the costs of development or home construction 

we are also subject to a significant number and variety of local state and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of health safety labor standards and the environment the impact of environmental laws varies depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available these matters may result in delays may cause us to incur substantial compliance remediation mitigation and other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas government agencies also routinely initiate audits reviews or investigations of our business practices to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations which can cause us to incur costs or create other disruptions in our business that can be significant for example we have received notices of violation from the united states environmental protection agency related to stormwater compliance at certain of our sites in our southeast region this matter could potentially result in requirements for us to perform additional compliance procedures and to pay monetary sanctions 

government restrictions standards or regulations intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or potential climate change impacts are likely to result in restrictions on land development in certain areas and may increase energy transportation or raw material costs which could reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations this is a particular concern in the western united states where some of the most extensive and stringent environmental laws and residential building construction standards in the country have been enacted and where we have business operations 

the subcontractors we rely on to perform the actual construction of our homes are also subject to a significant number of local state and federal laws and regulations including laws involving matters that are not within our control if the subcontractors who construct our homes fail to comply with all applicable laws we can suffer reputational damage and may be exposed to possible liability 

we are also subject to an extensive number of laws and regulations because our common stock and debt securities and the common stock of our forestar subsidiary are publicly traded in the capital markets these regulations govern our communications with our shareholders and the capital markets our financial statement disclosures and our legal processes and they also impact the work required to be performed by our independent registered public accounting firm and our legal counsel changes in these laws and regulations including the subsequent implementation of rules by the administering government authorities may require us to incur additional compliance costs and such costs may be significant 

governmental regulation of our financial services operations could adversely affect our business or financial results 

our financial services operations are subject to extensive state and federal laws and regulations which are administered by numerous agencies including but not limited to the cfpb federal housing finance agency us department of housing and urban development fha va usda fannie mae freddie mac and ginnie mae these laws and regulations include many compliance requirements including but not limited to licensing consumer disclosures fair lending and real estate settlement procedures as a result our operations are subject to regular extensive examinations by the applicable agencies additional future regulations or changing rule interpretations and examinations by regulatory agencies may result in more stringent compliance standards and could adversely affect the results of our operations 

homebuilding lot development and financial services are competitive industries and competitive conditions could adversely affect our business or financial results 

the homebuilding and lot development industries are highly competitive homebuilders compete not only for homebuyers but also for desirable properties financing raw materials and skilled labor we compete with local regional and national homebuilders and developers and also with existing home sales foreclosures and rental properties the competitive conditions in the homebuilding industry can negatively affect our sales volumes selling prices and incentive levels reduce our profit margins and cause the value of our inventory or other assets to be impaired competition can also affect our ability to acquire suitable land raw materials and skilled labor at acceptable prices or terms or cause delays in land development or in the construction of our homes 

the competitors to our financial services businesses include other title companies and mortgage lenders including national regional and local mortgage banks and other financial institutions some of these competitors are subject to fewer governmental regulations and have greater access to capital than we do and some of them may operate with different lending criteria than we do these competitors may offer a broader or more attractive array of financing and other products and services to potential customers than we do 

our businesses compete with other companies across all industries to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced employees managers and executives competition for the services of these individuals increases as business conditions improve in the homebuilding lot development and financial services industries and in the general economy if we are unable to attract and retain key employees managers or executives our business could be adversely affected 

risks related to our indebtedness 

we have significant amounts of debt and may incur additional debt which could affect our financial health and our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations or potential acquisitions 

as of september 30 2020 our consolidated debt was 43 billion which consisted of 25 billion related to our homebuilding segment 11 billion related to our financial services segment and 6411 million related to our forestar segment we had 16 billion principal amount of our debt maturing before the end of fiscal 2021 including 400 million principal amount of homebuilding senior notes and 11 billion outstanding under the mortgage repurchase facility the indentures governing our homebuilding senior notes do not restrict the incurrence of future unsecured debt by us or our homebuilding subsidiaries or the incurrence of secured or unsecured debt by our nonguarantor subsidiaries and the agreements governing our homebuilding revolving credit facilities allow us to incur a substantial amount of future unsecured debt also the indentures governing our homebuilding senior notes and the agreements governing our homebuilding revolving credit facilities impose restrictions on our ability and on that of the guarantors under our homebuilding senior notes and our homebuilding revolving credit facilities to incur debt secured by certain assets but still permit us and our homebuilding subsidiaries to incur significant amounts of additional secured debt the forestar revolving credit facility and the indentures governing forestar’s senior notes impose restrictions on the ability of forestar and its restricted subsidiaries to incur secured and unsecured debt but still permit forestar and its subsidiaries to incur a substantial amount of future secured and unsecured debt and do not restrict the incurrence of future secured and unsecured debt by forestar’s unrestricted subsidiaries 

the amount and the maturities of our debt and the debt of our subsidiaries could have important consequences for example possible consequences for our homebuilding financial services and forestar operations each with respect to their individual debt obligations could 

• require the dedication of a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to payment of debt and reduce the ability to use cash flow for other operating or investing purposes 

• limit the flexibility to adjust to changes in business or economic conditions and 

• limit the ability to obtain future financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions debt service requirements or other requirements 

servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash and we or our subsidiaries may not have sufficient cash flow from our respective businesses to pay our substantial debt 

our ability and that of our subsidiaries to meet our respective debt service obligations will depend in part upon our and our subsidiaries’ future financial performance future results are subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report our revenues and earnings vary with the level of general economic activity in the markets we serve our businesses are also affected by financial political business and other factors many of which are beyond our control the factors that affect our ability to generate cash can also affect our ability to raise additional funds for these purposes through the sale of debt or equity the refinancing of debt or the sale of assets changes in prevailing interest rates may affect the cost of our debt service obligations because borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and mortgage repurchase facility bear interest at floating rates 

the instruments governing our and our subsidiaries’ indebtedness impose certain restrictions on our and our subsidiaries’ business and the ability of us and our subsidiaries to comply with related covenants restrictions or limitations could adversely affect our and our subsidiaries’ financial condition or operating flexibility 

the restrictions imposed by our and certain of our subsidiaries’ indebtedness could limit our or our subsidiaries’ ability to plan for or react to market or economic conditions or meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans and adversely affect our or our subsidiaries’ ability to finance our operations acquisitions investments or strategic alliances or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest 

the agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on our and our guarantor subsidiaries’ ability to among other things engage in sale and leaseback transactions with respect to certain assets incur secured debt create liens pay dividends and make other distributions on or redeem or repurchase equity securities sell certain assets and engage in mergers consolidations or sales of all or substantially all of our assets the instruments governing forestar’s indebtedness contain restrictions on the ability of forestar and certain of its subsidiaries to among other things incur additional indebtedness create liens pay dividends and make other distributions on or redeem or repurchase equity securities sell certain assets enter into affiliate transactions and engage in mergers consolidations or sales of all or substantially all of forestar’s assets 

in addition the agreements governing certain of our and our subsidiaries’ debt instruments contain the following financial covenants 

homebuilding revolving credit facilities our homebuilding revolving credit facilities contain financial covenants requiring the maintenance of a maximum allowable leverage ratio and a borrowing base restriction if our leverage ratio exceeds a certain level a failure to comply with these financial covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under the revolving credit facilities or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity 

forestar’s revolving credit facility the forestar revolving credit facility contains financial covenants requiring the maintenance by forestar of a minimum level of tangible net worth a minimum level of liquidity a maximum allowable leverage ratio and a borrowing base restriction based on the book value of forestar’s real estate assets and unrestricted cash a failure to comply with these financial covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under this revolving credit facility or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity 

mortgage repurchase facility and other restrictions the mortgage repurchase facility for our mortgage subsidiary requires the maintenance of a minimum level of tangible net worth a maximum allowable leverage ratio and a minimum level of liquidity by our mortgage subsidiary a failure to comply with these requirements could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds to our mortgage subsidiary or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity any difficulty experienced in complying with these covenants could make the renewal of the facility more difficult or costly 

in addition although our financial services business is conducted through subsidiaries that are not restricted by the indentures governing our senior notes or the agreements governing our revolving credit facilities the ability of our financial services subsidiaries to distribute funds to our homebuilding operations would be restricted in the event such distribution would cause an event of default under the mortgage repurchase facility or if an event of default had occurred 

under this facility moreover our right to receive assets from our financial services subsidiaries upon their liquidation or recapitalization is subject to the prior claims of the creditors of these subsidiaries any claims we may have to funds from our financial services subsidiaries would be subordinate to subsidiary indebtedness to the extent of any security for such indebtedness and to any indebtedness otherwise recognized as senior to our claims 

our access to capital and our ability to obtain additional financing could be affected by any downgrade of our debt ratings 

our homebuilding senior unsecured debt is currently rated investment grade by all three major rating agencies however there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain these ratings any lowering of our debt ratings could make accessing the public capital markets or obtaining additional credit from banks more difficult andor more expensive any lowering of forestar’s debt ratings could also make forestar’s ability to access the public capital markets or obtain additional credit from banks more difficult andor more expensive 

the instruments governing our indebtedness contain change of control provisions which could affect the timing of repayment 

change of control purchase options under our homebuilding senior notes and change of control default under our homebuilding revolving credit facilities upon the occurrence of both a change of control and a ratings downgrade event each as defined in the indentures governing our homebuilding senior notes we will be required to offer to repurchase such notes at 101 of their principal amount together with all accrued and unpaid interest if any moreover a change of control as defined in our homebuilding revolving credit facilities would constitute an event of default under our homebuilding revolving credit facilities which could result in the acceleration of the repayment of any borrowings outstanding under the facilities a requirement to cash collateralize all letters of credit outstanding thereunder and the termination of the commitments thereunder if repayment of more than 50 million outstanding under our homebuilding revolving credit facilities were accelerated and such acceleration were not rescinded or such indebtedness were not satisfied in either case within 30 days an event of default would result under the indentures governing our homebuilding senior notes entitling the trustee for the notes or holders of at least 25 in principal amount of the relevant series of notes then outstanding to declare all such notes to be due and payable immediately if purchase offers were required under the indentures for our homebuilding senior notes repayment of the borrowings under our homebuilding revolving credit facilities were required or if the senior notes were accelerated we can give no assurance that we would have sufficient funds to pay the required amounts 

change of control purchase option under forestar’s notes and change of control default under the forestar revolving credit facility upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event as defined in the indentures governing forestar’s notes forestar will be required to offer to repurchase forestar’s notes at 101 of their principal amount together with all accrued and unpaid interest if any a change of control as defined in the forestar revolving credit facility with respect to forestar would constitute an event of default under the forestar revolving credit facility which could result in the acceleration of the repayment of any borrowings outstanding under the facility a requirement to cash collateralize all letters of credit outstanding thereunder and the termination of the commitments thereunder if the maturity of the forestar revolving credit facility andor other indebtedness of forestar and its restricted subsidiaries together having an aggregate principal amount outstanding of 40 million or more is accelerated an event of default would result under the indentures governing the forestar notes entitling the trustee for the forestar notes or holders of at least 25 in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding forestar notes to declare all such forestar notes to be due and payable immediately if purchase offers were required under the indentures for forestar’s notes repayment of the borrowings under forestar’s revolving credit facility were required or if forestar’s notes were accelerated we can give no assurance that forestar would have sufficient funds to pay the required amounts 

general risk factors 

damage to our corporate reputation or brands from negative publicity could adversely affect our business financial results andor stock price 

adverse publicity related to our company industry personnel operations or business performance may cause damage to our corporate reputation or brands and may generate negative sentiment potentially affecting the performance of our business or our stock price regardless of its accuracy or inaccuracy negative publicity can be disseminated rapidly through digital platforms including social media websites blogs and newsletters customers and other interested parties value readily available information and often act on such information without further investigation and without 

regard to its accuracy the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction and our success in preserving our brand image depends on our ability to recognize respond to and effectively manage negative publicity in a rapidly changing environment adverse publicity or unfavorable commentary from any source could damage our reputation reduce the demand for our homes or negatively impact the morale and performance of our employees which could adversely affect our business 

our business could be adversely affected by the loss of key personnel 

we rely on our key personnel to effectively operate and manage our businesses specifically our success depends heavily on the performance of our homebuilding division and region presidents and their management teams our financial services management team our corporate office management teams our forestar management team and our executive officers these key personnel have significant experience and skills in the homebuilding lot development and financial services industries as well as leadership and management abilities that are important to our success we seek to retain our key personnel and to have succession plans in place to address the potential loss of key personnel however if our retention and succession planning efforts are unsuccessful or if we fail to attract suitable replacements the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business 

information technology failures data security breaches and the failure to satisfy privacy and data protection laws and regulations could harm our business 

we use information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational and marketing activities and to maintain our business records these information technology systems are dependent upon global communications providers web browsers thirdparty software and data storage providers and other aspects of the internet infrastructure that have experienced security breaches cyberattacks significant systems failures and service outages in the past our normal business activities involve collecting and storing information specific to our homebuyers employees vendors and suppliers and maintaining operational and financial information related to our business both in an office setting and remote locations as needed a material breach in the security of our information technology systems or other data security controls could include the theft or release of this information a data security breach a significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems or a breach of any of our data security controls could disrupt our business operations damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers adversely impact our sales and revenue and require us to incur significant expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve these kinds of issues the unintended or unauthorized disclosure of personal identifying and confidential information as a result of a security breach could also lead to litigation or other proceedings against us by the affected individuals or business partners or by regulators the outcome of such proceedings which could include penalties or fines could have a significant negative impact on our business 

we may also be required to incur significant costs to protect against damages caused by information technology failures security breaches and the failure to satisfy privacy and data protection laws and regulations in the future as legal requirements continue to increase the european union and other international regulators as well as state governments have recently enacted or enhanced data privacy regulations such as the california consumer privacy act and other governments are considering establishing similar or stronger protections these regulations impose certain obligations for handling specified personal information in our systems and for apprising individuals of the information we have collected about them we have incurred costs in an effort to comply with these requirements and our costs may increase significantly if new requirements are enacted and based on how individuals exercise their rights any noncompliance could result in our incurring substantial penalties and reputational damage and also could result in litigation 

we provide employee awareness training of cybersecurity threats and routinely utilize information technology security experts to assist us in our evaluations of the effectiveness of the security of our information technology systems and we regularly enhance our security measures to protect our systems and data our increased use of remote work environments and virtual platforms in response to c19 may also increase our risk of cyberattack or data security breaches we use various encryption tokenization and authentication technologies to mitigate cybersecurity risks and have increased our monitoring capabilities to enhance early detection and rapid response to potential cyber threats however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures consequently we cannot provide assurances that a security breach cyberattack data theft or other significant systems or security failures will not occur in the future and such occurrences could have a material and adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

none 




 item 2 properties 

our homebuilding and forestar operations own inventories of land lots and homes and dhi communities owns multifamily rental properties that are both completed and under construction as part of the ordinary course of our business we also own office buildings totaling approximately 11 million square feet and we lease approximately 570000 square feet of office space under leases expiring through february 2026 these properties are located in our various operating markets to house our homebuilding forestar and financial services operating divisions and our regional and corporate offices

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

results of operations — overview 

fiscal 2020 operating results 

in fiscal 2020 our number of homes closed and home sales revenues increased 15 and 16 respectively compared to the prior year and our consolidated revenues increased 15 to 203 billion compared to 176 billion in the prior year our pretax income was 30 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to 21 billion in fiscal 2019 and our pretax operating margin was 147 compared to 121 net income was 24 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to 16 billion in the prior year the current year results include a tax benefit of 934 million related to the retroactive reinstatement of the federal energy efficient homes tax credit 

cash provided by our homebuilding operations was 19 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to 14 billion in fiscal 2019 in fiscal 2020 our return on equity roe was 221 compared to 172 in fiscal 2019 and our homebuilding return on inventory roi was 246 compared to 181 roe is calculated as net income attributable to dr horton for the year divided by average stockholders’ equity where average stockholders’ equity is the sum of ending stockholders’ equity balances of the trailing five quarters divided by five homebuilding roi is calculated as homebuilding pretax income for the year divided by average inventory where average inventory is the sum of ending homebuilding inventory balances for the trailing five quarters divided by five 

within our homebuilding land and lot portfolio our lots controlled under purchase contracts represent 70 of the lots owned and controlled at september 30 2020 compared to 60 at september 30 2019 our relationship with forestar and expanded relationships with other land developers across the country have allowed us to increase the controlled portion of our finished lot pipeline 

covid19 

during the latter part of march 2020 the impacts of c19 and the related widespread reductions in economic activity across the united states began to adversely affect our business however residential construction and financial services were designated as essential businesses in almost all of our markets which allowed us to continue to operate during that time we implemented operational protocols to comply with social distancing and other health and safety standards as required by federal state and local government agencies taking into consideration guidelines of the centers for disease control and prevention and other public health authorities 

during april 2020 when restrictive stayathome orders were in place for many markets across the united states we experienced increases in sales cancellations and decreases in sales orders and net sales orders for april were 1 lower than the same month in the prior year however as economic activity began to resume and restrictive orders began to be lifted our weekly sales pace increased significantly and our cancellation rate returned to normal levels for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2020 our net sales orders increased by 38 and 81 respectively compared to the prior year quarters 

we believe the increase in demand in the second half of the year was fueled by increased buyer urgency due to lower interest rates on mortgage loans the limited supply of homes at affordable price points across most of our markets and to some extent the lower levels of home sales from midmarch through early april which caused some pentup demand we were and remain well positioned for increased demand with our affordable product offerings lot supply and housing inventory 

however even with the resurgence of demand in our third and fourth quarters we remain cautious as to the ongoing impact of c19 on our operations and on the overall economy there is significant uncertainty regarding the extent to which and how long c19 and its related effects will impact the us economy and level of employment capital markets secondary mortgage markets consumer confidence demand for our homes and availability of mortgage loans to homebuyers the extent to which this impacts our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments including the duration and spread of c19 and the impact on our customers trade partners and employees all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted 

we believe our strong balance sheet and liquidity position provide us with the flexibility to operate effectively through changing economic conditions we plan to continue to generate strong cash flows from our homebuilding operations and manage our product offerings incentives home pricing sales pace and inventory levels to optimize the return on our inventory investments in each of our communities based on local housing market conditions 

strategy 

our operating strategy focuses on enhancing longterm value to our shareholders by leveraging our financial and competitive position in our core homebuilding business to increase the returns on our inventory investments and generate strong profitability and cash flows while managing risk and maintaining financial flexibility to navigate changing economic conditions and make opportunistic strategic investments we have made operational adjustments as a result of c19 however our strategy remains consistent and includes the following initiatives 

• developing and retaining highly experienced and productive teams of personnel throughout our company that are aligned and focused on continuous improvement in our operational execution and financial performance 

• maintaining a strong cash balance and overall liquidity position and controlling our level of debt 

• allocating and actively managing our inventory investments across our operating markets to diversify our geographic risk 

• offering new home communities that appeal to a broad range of entrylevel moveup active adult and luxury homebuyers based on consumer demand in each market 

• modifying product offerings sales pace home prices and sales incentives as necessary in each of our markets to meet consumer demand and maintain affordability 

• delivering high quality homes and a positive experience to our customers both during and after the sale 

• managing our inventory of homes under construction relative to demand in each of our markets including starting construction on unsold homes to capture new home demand and actively controlling the number of unsold completed homes in inventory 

• investing in land and land development in desirable markets while controlling the level of land and lots we own in each market relative to the local new home demand 

• continuing to seek opportunities to expand the portion of our land and finished lots controlled through purchase contracts by assisting forestar with its operations and expanding our relationships with land developers across the country 

• controlling the cost of goods purchased from both vendors and subcontractors 

• improving the efficiency of our land development construction sales and other key operational activities 

• controlling our selling general and administrative sga expense infrastructure to match production levels 

• opportunistically evaluating potential acquisitions to enhance our operations and improve returns 

• ensuring that our financial services business provides high quality mortgage and title services to homebuyers efficiently and effectively 

• investing in the construction of singlefamily and multifamily rental properties to meet rental demand in high growth suburban markets and selling these properties profitably 

we believe our operating strategy which has produced positive results in recent years will allow us to successfully operate through changing economic conditions to maintain and improve our financial and competitive position however we cannot provide any assurances that the initiatives listed above will continue to be successful and we may need to adjust components of our strategy to meet future market conditions

results of operations — homebuilding 

our operating segments are our 53 homebuilding divisions our majorityowned forestar lot development operations our financial services operations and our other business activities the homebuilding operating segments are aggregated into six reporting segments these reporting segments which we also refer to as reporting regions have homebuilding operations located in the following states 



the following tables and related discussion set forth key operating and financial data for our homebuilding operations by reporting segment as of and for the fiscal years ended september 30 2020 and 2019 for similar operating and financial data and discussion of our fiscal 2019 results compared to our fiscal 2018 results refer to item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under part ii of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended september 30 2019 which was filed with the sec on november 25 2019 



 

1 net sales orders represent the number and dollar value of new sales contracts executed with customers gross sales orders net of cancelled sales orders 



 

1 cancellation rate represents the number of cancelled sales orders divided by gross sales orders 

net sales orders 

the number of net sales orders increased 39 during 2020 compared to 2019 with significant increases in all of our regions the value of net sales orders increased 40 to 236 billion 78458 homes in 2020 from 168 billion 56565 homes in 2019 the average selling price of net sales orders during fiscal 2020 was 300900 up 1 from the prior year 

the markets contributing most to the increases in sales volumes in our regions were as follows the carolina markets particularly myrtle beach and charlotte in the east the denver minneapolis and indiana markets in the midwest the florida markets particularly tampa in the southeast the houston and dallas markets in the south central the phoenix market in the southwest and the california and nevada markets in the west 

our sales order cancellation rate cancelled sales orders divided by gross sales orders for the period was 20 in 2020 compared to 21 in 2019 

the increase in our sales orders reflects the increase in demand for our homes in the second half of the year fueled by increased buyer urgency due to lower interest rates on mortgage loans the limited supply of homes at affordable price points across most of our markets and to some extent the lower levels of home sales from midmarch through early april which caused some pentup demand 



sales order backlog 

sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies including mortgage loan approval and buyers selling their existing homes which can result in cancellations a portion of the contracts in backlog will not result in closings due to cancellations 



home sales revenue 

revenues from home sales increased 16 to 196 billion 65388 homes closed in 2020 from 169 billion 56975 homes closed in 2019 home sales revenues increased in all of our regions primarily due to an increase in the number of homes closed 

the number of homes closed in fiscal 2020 increased 15 from 2019 the markets contributing most to the increase in closing volumes in our regions were as follows the new jersey myrtle beach and charlotte markets in the east the denver and indianapolis markets in the midwest the florida markets particularly tampa in the southeast the houston dallas and san antonio markets in the south central the tucson market in the southwest and the portland and southern california markets in the west 

homebuilding operating margin analysis 



home sales gross profit 

gross profit from home sales increased to 43 billion in 2020 from 34 billion in 2019 and increased 160 basis points to 218 as a percentage of home sales revenues the percentage increase resulted from improvements of 150 basis points due to a decrease in the average cost of our homes closed while the average selling price increased slightly 20 basis points from a decrease in the amount of purchase accounting adjustments related to prior year acquisitions and 10 basis points due to a decrease in the amortization of capitalized interest partially offset by increased warranty and construction defect costs of 20 basis points 

we remain focused on managing the pricing incentives and sales pace in each of our communities to optimize the returns on our inventory investments and adjust to local market conditions and new home demand these actions could cause our gross profit margins to fluctuate in future periods if a prolonged economic recession and a resulting decline in new home demand occur due to c19 or otherwise we would expect our gross profit margins to decline from current levels 

landlot sales and other revenues 

landlot sales and other revenues from our homebuilding operations were 831 million and 919 million in fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively we continually evaluate our land and lot supply and fluctuations in revenues and profitability from land sales occur based on how we manage our inventory levels in various markets we generally purchase land and lots with the intent to build and sell homes on them however some of the land that we purchase includes commercially zoned parcels that we may sell to commercial developers we may also sell residential lots or land parcels to manage our supply or for other strategic reasons as of september 30 2020 our homebuilding operations had 283 million of land held for sale that we expect to sell in the next twelve months 

inventory and land option charges 

at the end of each quarter we review the performance and outlook for all of our communities and land inventories for indicators of potential impairment and perform detailed impairment evaluations and analyses when necessary as of september 30 2020 we performed detailed impairment evaluations of communities with a combined carrying value of 361 million and determined that no communities were impaired homebuilding impairment charges during fiscal 2020 and 2019 were 17 million and 249 million respectively 

as we manage our inventory investments across our operating markets to optimize returns and cash flows we may modify our pricing and incentives construction and development plans or land sale strategies in individual active communities and land held for development which could result in the affected communities being evaluated for potential impairment if the housing market or economic conditions are adversely affected for a prolonged period due to c19 or otherwise we may be required to evaluate additional communities for potential impairment these evaluations could result in additional impairment charges that could be significant 

during fiscal 2020 and 2019 earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs related to land purchase contracts that we have terminated or expect to terminate were 212 million and 283 million respectively 

selling general and administrative sga expense 

sga expense from homebuilding activities increased 8 to 16 billion in fiscal 2020 from 15 billion in fiscal 2019 sga expense as a percentage of homebuilding revenues was 82 and 87 in fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively 

employee compensation and related costs represented 75 of sga costs in fiscal 2020 compared to 72 in fiscal 2019 these costs increased 13 to 12 billion in 2020 from 11 billion in 2019 our homebuilding operations employed 7281 and 6810 employees at september 30 2020 and 2019 respectively 

we attempt to control our sga costs while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports our operations however we cannot make assurances that we will be able to maintain or improve upon the current sga expense as a percentage of revenues 

interest incurred 

we capitalize interest costs incurred to inventory during active development and construction active inventory capitalized interest is charged to cost of sales as the related inventory is delivered to the buyer interest incurred by our homebuilding operations decreased 11 to 930 million in fiscal 2020 from 1047 million in fiscal 2019 the decrease was due to lower average interest rates on our homebuilding debt as well as a 2 decrease in our average homebuilding debt in fiscal 2020 compared to the prior year interest charged to cost of sales was 08 and 09 of total cost of sales excluding inventory and land option charges in fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively 

other income 

other income net of other expenses included in our homebuilding operations was 117 million in fiscal 2020 compared to 95 million in fiscal 2019 other income consists of interest income rental income and various other types of ancillary income gains expenses and losses not directly associated with sales of homes land and lots the activities that result in this ancillary income are not significant either individually or in the aggregate 

business acquisition 

in october 2020 we acquired the homebuilding operations of braselton homes for approximately 23 million in cash braselton homes operates in corpus christi texas the assets acquired included approximately 90 homes in inventory 95 lots and control of approximately 840 additional lots through purchase contracts we also acquired a sales order backlog of approximately 125 homes

the volume of loans originated by our mortgage operations is directly related to the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations in fiscal 2020 the volume of firstlien loans originated or brokered by dhi mortgage for our homebuyers increased 35 from the prior year due to an increase in the percentage of homes closed for which dhi mortgage handled the homebuyers’ financing as well a 15 increase in the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations the percentage of homes closed for which dhi mortgage handled the homebuyers’ financing was 68 in fiscal 2020 compared to 58 in the prior year the increase in this percentage was primarily due to the company’s program to offer below market interest rates to dr horton homebuyers expanded coverage in certain markets and increased efficiencies resulting from technology advances 

homes closed by our homebuilding operations constituted 97 and 98 of dhi mortgage loan originations in fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively these percentages reflect dhi mortgage’s consistent focus on the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations 

the number of loans sold increased 35 in fiscal 2020 compared to the prior year virtually all of the mortgage loans held for sale on september 30 2020 were eligible for sale to fannie mae freddie mac or ginnie mae during fiscal 2020 approximately 66 of our mortgage loans were sold directly to fannie mae or into securities backed by ginnie mae and 28 were sold to two other major financial entities changes in market conditions could result in a greater concentration of our mortgage sales in future periods to fewer financial entities and directly to fannie mae or ginnie mae and we may need to make other adjustments to our mortgage operations 

due to the disruption in the secondary mortgage markets beginning in late march 2020 caused by c19 and the uncertainty of the impact of the cares act many financial entities began offering lower pricing and limiting their purchases of our mortgages and servicing rights as a result of the rapid decline in servicing values at the end of march we began retaining the servicing rights on a portion of our loan originations servicing values have since improved and we expect to sell these rights to third parties 

financial services revenues and expenses 

revenues from our mortgage operations increased 34 to 4767 million in fiscal 2020 from 3555 million in fiscal 2019 primarily due to a 36 increase in loan originations during the fourth quarter due to better clarity related to the cares act pricing and execution in the secondary market improved from the previous nine months ended june 30 2020 which caused revenues in the fourth quarter to increase at a higher rate than origination volume revenues from our title operations increased 26 to 1082 million in fiscal 2020 from 862 million in fiscal 2019 primarily due to a 28 increase in escrow closings 

general and administrative ga expense related to our financial services operations increased 24 to 3647 million in fiscal 2020 from 2930 million in the prior year the increase was primarily due to an increase in employee related costs to support a higher volume of transactions our financial services operations employed 2163 and 1924 employees at september 30 2020 and 2019 respectively 

as a percentage of financial services revenues ga expense was 624 in fiscal 2020 compared to 663 in the prior year fluctuations in financial services ga expense as a percentage of revenues occur because some components of revenue fluctuate differently than loan volumes and some expenses are not directly related to mortgage loan volume or to changes in the amount of revenue earned 

other income net of other expense included in our financial services operations consists primarily of the interest income of our mortgage subsidiary 

as a result of the revenue increases from higher volumes of mortgage originations and escrow closings which also allowed us to better leverage our ga expenses pretax income from our financial services operations increased 47 to 2452 million in fiscal 2020 from 1663 million in fiscal 2019 

results of operations — other businesses 

the combined pretax income of all of our subsidiaries engaged in other business activities was 551 million in fiscal 2020 compared to 555 million in fiscal 2019 income generated by our other businesses can vary significantly based on the timing of sales of multifamily rental properties 

through dhi communities a 100 owned subsidiary we develop construct and own multifamily residential properties that produce rental income dhi communities is primarily focused on constructing garden style multifamily communities which typically accommodate 200 to 400 dwelling units in high growth suburban markets after dhi communities has completed construction and achieved a stabilized level of leased occupancy the property is typically marketed for sale during fiscal 2020 and 2019 dhi communities sold multifamily rental properties for a total of 1285 million and 1334 million respectively and recorded gains on sale totaling 594 million and 519 million dhi communities had five projects under active construction and one project that was substantially complete at september 30 2020 these six projects represent 1730 multifamily units including 1430 units under active construction and 300 completed units 

results of operations — consolidated 

income before income taxes 

pretax income was 30 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to 21 billion in fiscal 2019 the increase was primarily due to an increase in pretax income generated by our homebuilding operations as a result of higher revenues from increased home closings and an increase in home sales gross margin in fiscal 2020 our homebuilding financial services and other businesses generated pretax income of 27 billion 2452 million and 551 million respectively compared to pretax income of 19 billion 1663 million and 555 million respectively in fiscal 2019 

income taxes 

our income tax expense was 6025 million and 5067 million in fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively and our effective tax rate was 202 and 238 in those years the effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 includes a tax benefit of 934 million from the enactment of the taxpayer certainty and disaster tax relief act of 2019 the act the act retroactively reinstated the federal energy efficient homes tax credit that expired on december 31 2017 to homes closed from january 1 2018 to december 31 2020 the effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 also includes a tax benefit of 112 million related to the release of a valuation allowance against our state deferred tax assets the effective tax rates for both years include an expense for state income taxes reduced by tax benefits related to stockbased compensation 

our deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities were 1524 million at september 30 2020 compared to 1818 million at september 30 2019 we have a valuation allowance of 75 million and 187 million at september 30 2020 and 2019 respectively related to state deferred tax assets for net operating loss nol carryforwards that are more likely than not to expire before being realized the decrease in the valuation allowance is primarily attributable to our determination that we will have sufficient future taxable income in certain state tax jurisdictions to realize a portion of our state nol carryforwards we will continue to evaluate both the positive and negative evidence in determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to our remaining state nol carryforwards any reversal of the valuation allowance in future periods will impact our effective tax rate 

dr horton has 158 million of tax benefits for state nol carryforwards that expire at various times depending on the tax jurisdiction of the total amount 54 million of the tax benefits expire over the next ten years and the remaining 104 million expires from fiscal years 2031 to 2040 forestar has 17 million of tax benefits for state nol carryforwards that expire at various times depending on the tax jurisdiction 

the accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future results could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position also changes in existing federal and state tax laws and tax rates could affect future tax results and the valuation of our deferred tax assets 

unrecognized tax benefits are the differences between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefits recognized in our financial statements our unrecognized tax benefits totaled 89 million at september 30 2020 and were insignificant at september 30 2019 

dr horton is subject to federal income tax and state income tax in multiple jurisdictions the statute of limitations for dr horton’s major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for fiscal years 2017 through 2020 dr horton is not currently under audit for federal income tax but is under audit by various states we are not aware of any significant findings by the state taxing authorities 

forestar is subject to federal income tax and state income tax in multiple jurisdictions the statute of limitations for forestar’s major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for tax years 2016 through 2020 forestar is not currently under audit for federal or state income taxes 

capital resources and liquidity 

we have historically funded our operations with cash flows from operating activities borrowings under bank credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities our current levels of cash borrowing capacity and balance sheet leverage provide us with the operational flexibility to adjust to changes in economic and market conditions we remain cautious as to the ongoing impact of c19 on the us economy and will adjust our strategy as appropriate should market conditions change due to the pandemic or otherwise 

in the current market we are increasing our investments in homebuilding inventories and singlefamily and multifamily rental properties to expand our operations and grow our revenues and profitability as well as considering opportunistic strategic investments as they arise we are also maintaining higher homebuilding cash balances than in prior years to support the increased scale and level of activity in our business and to provide flexibility to adjust to changing conditions and opportunities 

at september 30 2020 our ratio of debt to total capital notes payable divided by stockholders’ equity plus notes payable was 266 compared to 253 at september 30 2019 our ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital homebuilding notes payable divided by stockholders’ equity plus homebuilding notes payable was 175 compared to 170 at september 30 2019 over the long term we intend to maintain our ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital below 35 and we expect it to remain significantly lower than 35 throughout fiscal 2021 we believe that the ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital is useful in understanding the leverage employed in our homebuilding operations and comparing our capital structure with other homebuilders we exclude the debt of forestar and our financial services business because they are separately capitalized and not guaranteed by our parent company or any of our homebuilding entities 

we regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund growth in our business repay debt obligations pay dividends repurchase our common stock and maintain sufficient cash levels to support our other operational needs and we regularly evaluate our opportunities to raise additional capital dr horton has an automatically effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec in august 2018 registering debt and equity securities that may be issued from time to time in amounts to be determined forestar also has an effective shelf registration statement filed with the sec in september 2018 registering 500 million of equity securities at september 30 2020 3943 million remained available under forestar’s shelf registration statement 100 million of which is reserved for sales under its atthemarket equity offering program as market conditions permit we may issue new debt or equity securities through the capital markets or obtain additional bank financing to fund our projected capital requirements or provide additional liquidity we believe that our existing cash resources revolving credit facilities mortgage repurchase facility and ability to access the capital markets or obtain additional bank financing will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our nearterm working capital needs and debt obligations including the maturity of 400 million aggregate principal amount of our homebuilding senior notes in fiscal 2021 however due to the current economic uncertainties related to c19 we may be limited in accessing the capital markets or obtaining additional bank financing or the cost of accessing this financing could become more expensive for funding our longerterm capital needs

contractual cash obligations commercial commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

our primary contractual cash obligations are payments under our debt agreements and lease payments under operating leases we expect to fund our contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business through a combination of our existing cash resources cash flows generated from profits our credit facilities or other bank financing and the issuance of new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets as market conditions may permit 

our future cash requirements for contractual obligations as of september 30 2020 are presented below 



 

1 notes payable represents principal and interest payments due on our senior notes our secured notes our mortgage subsidiary’s repurchase facility and our homebuilding and forestar revolving credit facilities because the balances of our revolving credit facilities were zero at september 30 2020 we did not assume any principal or interest payments related to these facilities in future periods the interest obligation associated with our mortgage repurchase facility is based on its annual effective rate of 24 and principal balance outstanding at september 30 2020

at september 30 2020 we had outstanding letters of credit of 1789 million and surety bonds of 18 billion issued by third parties to secure performance under various contracts we expect that our performance obligations secured by these letters of credit and bonds will generally be completed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms when we complete our performance obligations the related letters of credit and bonds are generally released shortly thereafter leaving us with no continuing obligations we have no material thirdparty guarantees 

our mortgage subsidiary enters into various commitments related to the lending activities of our mortgage operations further discussion of these commitments is provided in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” under part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

supplemental guarantor financial information 

as of september 30 2020 dr horton inc had outstanding 245 billion principal amount of homebuilding senior notes due through october 2025 and no amounts outstanding on its homebuilding revolving credit facilities 

all of the homebuilding senior notes and the homebuilding revolving credit facilities are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by certain subsidiaries of dr horton inc guarantors or guarantor subsidiaries each of the guarantor subsidiaries is 100 owned directly or indirectly by dr horton inc our subsidiaries associated with the forestar lot development operation financial services operations multifamily residential construction and certain other subsidiaries do not guarantee the homebuilding senior notes or the homebuilding revolving credit facilities collectively nonguarantor subsidiaries the guarantees are senior unsecured obligations of each guarantor and rank equal with all existing and future senior debt of such guarantor and senior to all subordinated debt of such guarantor the guarantees are effectively subordinated to any secured debt of such guarantor to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt the guarantees will be structurally subordinated to indebtedness and other liabilities of nonguarantor subsidiaries of the guarantors 

the guarantees by a guarantor subsidiary will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon 1 the sale or other disposition of its common stock whereby it is no longer a subsidiary of ours 2 the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets other than to us or another guarantor 3 its merger or consolidation with an entity other than us or another guarantor or 4 its ceasing to guarantee any of our publicly traded debt securities and ceasing to guarantee any of our obligations under our homebuilding revolving credit facility 

the following tables present summarized financial information for dr horton inc and the guarantor subsidiaries on a combined basis after intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated among dr horton inc and the guarantor subsidiaries as well as their investment in and equity in earnings from the nonguarantor subsidiaries 



a court could void or subordinate any guarantor’s guarantee under the fraudulent conveyance laws if existing or future creditors of any such guarantor were successful in establishing that 

• such guarantee was incurred with fraudulent intent or 

• such guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for issuing its guarantee and 

• was insolvent at the time of the guarantee 

• was rendered insolvent by reason of the guarantee 

• was engaged in a business or transaction for which its assets constituted unreasonably small capital to carry on its business or 

• intended to incur or believed that it would incur debt beyond its ability to pay such debt as it matured 

the measures of insolvency for purposes of determining whether a fraudulent conveyance occurred would vary depending upon the laws of the relevant jurisdiction and upon the valuation assumptions and methodology applied by the court generally however a company would be considered insolvent for purposes of the foregoing if 

• the sum of the company’s debts including contingent unliquidated and unmatured liabilities is greater than all of such company’s property at a fair valuation or 

• the present fair saleable value of the company’s assets is less than the amount that will be required to pay the probable liability on its existing debts as they become absolute and matured 

the indentures governing our homebuilding senior notes contain a “savings clause” which limits the liability of each guarantor on its guarantee to the maximum amount that such guarantor can incur without risk that its guarantee will be subject to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer this provision may not be effective to protect such guarantees from fraudulent transfer challenges or if it does it may reduce such guarantor’s obligation such that the remaining amount due and collectible under the guarantees would not suffice if necessary to pay the notes in full when due 

on the basis of historical financial information operating history and other factors we believe that each of the guarantors after giving effect to the issuance of the guarantees when such guarantees were issued was not insolvent did not have unreasonably small capital for the business in which it engaged and did not and has not incurred debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature we cannot assure you however as to what standard a court would apply in making these determinations or that a court would agree with our conclusions in this regard 

seasonality 

although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again in the future we generally close more homes and generate greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year the seasonal nature of our business can also cause significant variations in our working capital requirements in our homebuilding lot development and financial services operations as a result of seasonal activity our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year 

inflation 

we may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation primarily because of higher financing land labor and material construction costs we attempt to offset cost increases in one component with savings in another and we increase our sales prices and reduce customer sales incentives when housing market conditions permit however during periods when housing market conditions are challenging we may not be able to offset cost increases with higher selling prices in addition higher mortgage interest rates reduce the affordability of our homes to prospective homebuyers

critical accounting policies 

general  — a comprehensive enumeration of the significant accounting policies of dr horton inc and subsidiaries is presented in note a to the accompanying financial statements as of september 30 2020 and 2019 and for the years ended september 30 2020 2019 and 2018 each of our accounting policies has been chosen based upon current authoritative literature that collectively comprises us generally accepted accounting principles gaap in instances where alternative methods of accounting are permissible under gaap we have chosen the method that most appropriately reflects the nature of our business the results of our operations and our financial condition and have consistently applied those methods over each of the periods presented in the financial statements the audit committee of our board of directors has reviewed and approved the accounting policies selected 

revenue recognition  — we generally recognize homebuilding revenue and related profit at the time of the closing of a sale when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer our performance obligation to deliver the agreedupon home is generally satisfied in less than one year from the original contract date proceeds from home closings held for our benefit at title companies are included in homebuilding cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets 

when we execute sales contracts with our homebuyers or when we require advance payment from homebuyers for custom changes upgrades or options related to their homes we record the cash deposits received as liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are cancelled we either retain or refund to the homebuyer deposits on cancelled sales contracts depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances 

we rarely purchase land for resale but periodically may elect to sell parcels of land that no longer fit into our strategic operating plans revenue from land sales is typically recognized on the closing date which is generally when performance obligations are satisfied 

we recognize financial services revenues associated with our title operations as closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued both of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed revenues associated with our mortgage operations primarily include net gains on the sale of mortgage loans and servicing rights we typically elect the fair value option for our mortgage loan originations whereby mortgage loans held for sale are recorded at fair value based on either sale commitments or current market quotes and loan values are adjusted through revenues for subsequent changes in fair value until the loans are sold expected gains and losses from the sale of servicing rights are included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through revenues at the time of commitment we sell substantially all of the mortgages we originate and the majority of the related servicing rights to thirdparty purchasers interest income is earned from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold 

mortgage loans are sold with limited recourse provisions which can result in repurchases of loans previously sold to investors or payments to reimburse investors for loan losses based on historical experience discussions with our mortgage purchasers analysis of the volume of mortgages we originated and current housing and credit market conditions we estimate and record a loss reserve for mortgage loans held in portfolio and mortgage loans held for sale as well as known and projected mortgage loan repurchase requests 

we collect insurance commissions on homeowner policies placed with third party carriers through our 100 owned insurance agency we recognize revenue and a contract asset for estimated future renewals of these policies upon issuance of the initial policy the date at which the performance obligation is satisfied 

inventories and cost of sales  — inventory includes the costs of direct land acquisition land development and home construction capitalized interest real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and home construction costs that we incur after development projects or homes are substantially complete such as utilities maintenance and cleaning are charged to sga expense as incurred all indirect overhead costs such as compensation of sales personnel division and region management and the costs of advertising and builder’s risk insurance are charged to sga expense as incurred 

land and development costs are typically allocated to individual residential lots on a prorata basis and the costs of residential lots are transferred to construction in progress when home construction begins home construction costs are specifically identified and recorded to individual homes cost of sales for homes closed includes the specific construction costs of each home and all applicable land acquisition land development and related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred allocated to each residential lot based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each community cost of sales for lots sold includes all applicable land acquisition land development and related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred allocated to each residential lot in the community any changes to the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial home or lot closings in a community are generally allocated on a prorata basis to the remaining homes or lots in the community associated with the relevant development activity 

when a home is closed we generally have not paid all incurred costs necessary to complete the home we record a liability and a corresponding charge to cost of sales for the amount estimated to ultimately be paid related to completed homes that have been closed we compare our home construction budgets to actual recorded costs to determine the additional costs remaining to be paid on each closed home we monitor the accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on closed homes in subsequent months to the amounts previously accrued although actual costs to be paid in the future on previously closed homes could differ from our current accruals such differences have not been significant 

at the end of each quarter we review the performance and outlook for all of our communities and land inventories for indicators of potential impairment we generally review our inventory for impairment indicators at the community level and the inventory within each community is categorized as land held for development residential land and lots developed and under development land held for sale and construction in progress and finished homes based on the stage of production or plans for future development or sale a particular community often includes inventory in more than one category in certain situations inventory may be analyzed separately for impairment purposes based on its product type or future plans in reviewing each of our communities we determine if impairment indicators exist on inventory held and used by analyzing a variety of factors including but not limited to the following 

• gross margins on homes closed in recent months 

• projected gross margins on homes sold but not closed 

• projected gross margins based on community budgets 

• trends in gross margins average selling prices or cost of sales 

• sales absorption rates and 

• performance of other communities in nearby locations 

if indicators of impairment are present for a community we perform an impairment evaluation of the community which includes an analysis to determine if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts if so impairment charges are recorded to cost of sales if the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying amounts these estimates of cash flows are significantly impacted by community specific factors including estimates of the amounts and timing of future revenues and estimates of the amount of land development materials and labor costs which in turn may be impacted by the following local market conditions 

• supply and availability of new and existing homes 

• location and desirability of our communities 

• variety of product types offered in the area 

• pricing and use of incentives by us and our competitors 

• alternative uses for our land or communities such as the sale of land finished lots or home sites to third parties 

• amount of land and lots we own or control in a particular market or submarket and 

• local economic and demographic trends 

for those assets deemed to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets our determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams when an impairment charge for a community is determined the charge is then allocated to each lot in the community in the same manner as land and development costs are allocated to each lot impairment charges are also recorded on finished homes in substantially completed communities when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values are greater than the fair values less estimated costs to sell these homes 

we rarely purchase land for resale however when we own land or communities under development that do not fit into our development and construction plans and we determine that we will sell the asset the project is accounted for as land held for sale if certain criteria are met we record land held for sale at the lesser of its carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell in performing the impairment evaluation for land held for sale we consider several factors including but not limited to recent offers received to purchase the property prices for land in recent comparable sales transactions and market analysis studies which include the estimated price a willing buyer would pay for the land if the estimated fair value less costs to sell an asset is less than the current carrying value the asset is written down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell 

the key assumptions relating to inventory valuations are impacted by local market and economic conditions and are inherently uncertain although our quarterly assessments reflect management’s best estimates due to uncertainties in the estimation process actual results could differ from such estimates 

warranty claims  — we typically provide our homebuyers with a tenyear limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems a twoyear limited warranty on major mechanical systems and a oneyear limited warranty on other construction components since we subcontract our construction work to subcontractors who typically provide us with an indemnity and a certificate of insurance prior to receiving payments for their work claims relating to workmanship and materials are generally the primary responsibility of the subcontractors warranty liabilities have been established by charging cost of sales for each home delivered the amounts charged are based on management’s estimate of expected warrantyrelated costs under all unexpired warranty obligation periods our warranty liability is based upon historical warranty cost experience in each market in which we operate and is adjusted to reflect qualitative risks associated with the types of homes we build and the geographic areas in which we build them actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts a 10 change in the historical warranty rates used to estimate our warranty accrual would not result in a material change in our accrual 

legal claims and insurance  — we are named as a defendant in various claims complaints and other legal actions in the ordinary course of business at any point in time we are managing several hundred individual claims related to construction defect matters personal injury claims employment matters land development issues contract disputes and other matters we have established reserves for these contingencies based on the estimated costs of pending claims and the estimated costs of anticipated future claims related to previously closed homes approximately 99 of these reserves related to construction defect matters at both september 30 2020 and 2019 

our reserves for construction defect claims include the estimated costs of both known claims and anticipated future claims at september 30 2020 and 2019 we had reserves for approximately 260 and 180 pending construction defect claims respectively and no individual existing claim was material to our financial statements during fiscal 2020 we established reserves for approximately 175 new construction defect claims and resolved 95 construction defect claims for a total cost of 258 million we have closed a significant number of homes during recent years and we may be subject to future construction defect claims on these homes although regulations vary from state to state construction defect issues can generally be reported for up to ten years after the home has closed in many states in which we operate historical data and trends regarding the frequency of claims incurred and the costs to resolve claims relative to the types of products and markets where we operate are used to estimate the construction defect liabilities for both existing and anticipated future claims these estimates are subject to ongoing revision as the circumstances of individual pending claims and historical data and trends change adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the accounting period in which the change in estimate occurs 

historical trends in construction defect claims have been inconsistent and we believe they may continue to fluctuate we also believe that fluctuations in housing market conditions can affect the frequency and cost of construction defect claims if the ultimate resolution of construction defect claims resulting from our home closings in prior years varies from current expectations it could significantly change our estimates regarding the frequency and timing of claims incurred and the costs to resolve existing and anticipated future claims which would impact the construction defect reserves in the future if the frequency of claims incurred or costs of existing and future legal claims significantly exceed our current estimates they will have a significant negative impact on our future earnings and liquidity 

we estimate and record receivables under the applicable insurance policies related to our estimated contingencies for known claims and anticipated future construction defect claims on previously closed homes and other legal claims and lawsuits incurred in the ordinary course of business when recovery is probable additionally we may have the ability to recover a portion of our losses from our subcontractors and their insurance carriers when we have been named as an additional insured on their insurance policies 

the estimation of losses related to these reserves and the related estimates of recoveries from insurance policies are subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends in construction defect claims relative to our markets and the types of products built claim frequency claim settlement costs and patterns insurance industry practices and legal interpretations among others due to the high degree of judgment required in establishing reserves for these contingencies actual future costs and recoveries from insurance could differ significantly from current estimated amounts a 10 increase in the claim frequency and the average cost per claim used to estimate the reserves would result in an increase of approximately 787 million in our reserves and a 402 million increase in our receivable resulting in additional expense of 385 million a 10 decrease in the claim frequency and the average cost per claim would result in a decrease of approximately 711 million in our reserves and a 333 million decrease in our receivable resulting in a reduction in expense of 378 million 

pending accounting pronouncements 

in june 2016 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201613 “financial instruments  credit losses” which replaces the current incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information in determining credit loss estimates the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2020 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in january 2017 the fasb issued asu 201704 “intangibles  goodwill and other” which simplifies the measurement of goodwill impairment by removing the second step of the goodwill impairment test and requires the determination of the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit under the new guidance goodwill impairment is measured as the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value with the loss recognized limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2020 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in december 2019 the fasb issued asu 201912 related to simplifying the accounting for income taxes the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2021 although early adoption is permitted we are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance and it is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in march 2020 the fasb issued asu 202004 “reference rate reform” which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying us gaap to contracts hedging relationships and other transactions affected by the discontinuation of the london interbank offered rate libor or by another reference rate expected to be discontinued the guidance was effective beginning march 12 2020 and can be applied prospectively through december 31 2022 we will adopt this standard when libor is discontinued and do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are subject to interest rate risk on our longterm debt we monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and utilize both fixed and variable rate debt for fixed rate debt changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows conversely for variable rate debt changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument but may affect our future earnings and cash flows except in very limited circumstances we do not have an obligation to prepay fixedrate debt prior to maturity and as a result interest rate risk and changes in fair value would not have a significant impact on our cash flows related to our fixedrate debt until such time as we are required to refinance repurchase or repay such debt 

we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with our mortgage loan origination services we manage interest rate risk through the use of forward sales of mbs which are referred to as “hedging instruments” in the following discussion we do not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate lock commitments irlcs are extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and who meet defined credit and underwriting criteria typically the irlcs have a duration of less than six months some irlcs are committed immediately to a specific purchaser through the use of bestefforts whole loan delivery commitments while other irlcs are funded prior to being committed to thirdparty purchasers the hedging instruments related to irlcs are classified and accounted for as derivative instruments in an economic hedge with gains and losses recognized in revenues in the consolidated statements of operations hedging instruments related to funded uncommitted loans are accounted for at fair value with changes recognized in revenues in the consolidated statements of operations along with changes in the fair value of the funded uncommitted loans the fair value change related to the hedging instruments generally offsets the fair value change in the uncommitted loans the net fair value change which for the years ended september 30 2020 and 2019 was not significant is recognized in current earnings at september 30 2020 hedging instruments used to mitigate interest rate risk related to uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale and uncommitted irlcs totaled a notional amount of 28 billion uncommitted irlcs totaled a notional amount of approximately 17 billion and uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale totaled a notional amount of approximately 12 billion at september 30 2020 

we occasionally enter into forward sales of mbs as part of a program to offer below market interest rate financing to our homebuyers in certain markets at september 30 2020 and 2019 we had mbs totaling 11 billion and 1114 million respectively that did not yet have irlcs or closed loans created or assigned and recorded a liability of 53 million and 05 million for the fair value of such mbs position 

the following table sets forth principal cash flows by scheduled maturity effective weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value of our debt obligations as of september 30 2020 because the mortgage repurchase facility is effectively secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale that are typically sold within 60 days its outstanding balance is included in the most current period presented the interest rate for our variable rate debt represents the weighted average interest rate in effect at september 30 2020

following is an overview of our company’s operating structure and the significant processes that support our business controls strategies and performance 

homebuilding markets 

our homebuilding business operates in 90 markets across 29 states which provides us with geographic diversification in our homebuilding inventory investments and our sources of revenues and earnings we believe our geographic diversification lowers our operational risks by mitigating the effects of local and regional economic cycles and it also enhances our earnings potential by providing more diverse opportunities to invest in our business 

we conduct our homebuilding operations in the geographic regions states and markets listed below and we conduct our financial services operations in many of these markets our homebuilding operating divisions are aggregated into six reporting segments also referred to as reporting regions which comprise the markets below our financial statements and the notes thereto contain additional information regarding segment performance 



when evaluating new or existing homebuilding markets for purposes of capital allocation we consider local marketspecific factors including among others 

 

economies of scale 

we are the largest homebuilding company in the united states in fiscal 2019 as measured by number of homes closed and we are also one of the largest builders in many of the markets in which we operate we believe that our national regional and local scale of operations provides us with benefits that may not be available to the same degree to some other smaller homebuilders such as 

 

decentralized homebuilding operations 

we view homebuilding as a local business therefore most of our direct homebuilding activities are decentralized to provide flexibility to our local managers in making operational decisions we believe that our local management teams who are familiar with local conditions have the best information to make many decisions regarding their operations at september 30 2019  we had 52 separate homebuilding operating divisions many of which operate in more than one market area generally each operating division consists of a division president a controller land entitlement acquisition and development personnel a sales manager and sales and marketing personnel a construction manager and construction superintendents customer service personnel a purchasing manager and office staff our division presidents receive performancebased compensation if they achieve targeted financial and operating metrics related to their operating divisions following is a summary of our homebuilding activities that are decentralized in our local operating divisions and the control and oversight functions that are centralized in our regional and corporate offices 

operating division responsibilities 

each operating division is responsible for 

 — a feasibility study 

— soil and environmental reviews 

— review of existing zoning and other governmental requirements 

— review of the need for and extent of offsite work required to obtain project entitlements and 

— financial analysis of the potential project 

 

centralized controls 

we centralize many important risk elements of our homebuilding business through our regional and corporate offices we have five separate homebuilding regional offices generally each regional office consists of a region president a chief financial officer legal counsel and other operational and office support staff each of our region presidents and their management teams are responsible for oversight of the operations of a number of homebuilding operating divisions including 

 

our corporate executives and corporate office departments are responsible for establishing our operational policies and internal control standards and for monitoring compliance with established policies and controls throughout our operations the corporate office also has primary responsibility for direct management of certain key risk elements and initiatives through the following centralized functions 

 

landlot acquisition and inventory management 

we acquire land for use in our homebuilding and forestar operations after we have completed due diligence and generally after we have obtained the rights known as entitlements to begin development or construction work resulting in an acceptable number of residential lots before we acquire lots or tracts of land we complete a feasibility study which includes soil tests independent environmental studies other engineering work and financial analysis we also evaluate the status of necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements required to develop and use the property for home construction although we purchase and develop land primarily to support our homebuilding activities we may sell land and lots to other developers and homebuilders where we have excess land and lot positions or for other strategic reasons 

we also enter into landlot contracts in which we obtain the right but generally not the obligation to buy land or lots at predetermined prices on a defined schedule commensurate with anticipated home closings or planned development these contracts generally are nonrecourse which limits our financial exposure to our earnest money deposited into escrow under the terms of the contract and any preacquisition due diligence costs we incur this enables us to control land and lot positions with limited capital investment which substantially reduces the risks associated with land ownership and development 

we directly acquire almost all of our land and lot positions we are a party to a small number of joint ventures joint ventures are consolidated if we have a controlling interest or accounted for under the equity method of accounting if we have a significant influence but not control 

we attempt to mitigate our exposure to real estate inventory risks by 

 

land development and home construction 

substantially all of our land development and home construction work is performed by subcontractors subcontractors typically are selected after a competitive bidding process and are retained for a specific subdivision or series of house plans pursuant to a contract that obligates the subcontractor to complete the scope of work at an agreedupon price we employ land development managers and construction superintendents to monitor land development and home construction activities participate in major design and building decisions coordinate the activities of subcontractors and suppliers review the work of subcontractors for quality and cost controls and monitor compliance with zoning and building codes in addition our construction superintendents interact with our homebuyers during the construction process and instruct buyers on postclosing home maintenance 

our home designs are selected or prepared in each of our markets to appeal to local homebuyers’ expectations for affordability home size and features and our local management teams adjust product offerings to meet buyer demand as necessary in many communities we offer optional interior and exterior features to homebuyers for an additional charge construction time for our homes depends on the availability of labor materials and supplies the weather the size of the home and other factors we complete the construction of most homes within two to six months  

we typically do not maintain significant inventories of land development or construction materials except for work in progress materials for active development projects and homes under construction generally the construction materials used in our operations are readily available from numerous sources we have contracts exceeding one year with certain suppliers of building materials that are cancelable at our option 

we are subject to governmental regulations that affect our land development and construction operations at times we have experienced delays in receiving the proper approvals from municipalities or other government agencies that have delayed our anticipated development and construction activities in certain communities 

cost controls 

we control construction costs by designing our homes efficiently and by obtaining competitive bids for construction materials and labor we also competitively bid and negotiate pricing from our subcontractors and suppliers based on the volume of services and products we purchase on a local regional and national basis we monitor our land development expenditures and construction costs versus budgets for each house and community and we review our inventory levels margins expenses profitability and returns for each operating market compared to both its business plan and our performance expectations 

we control overhead costs by centralizing certain accounting and administrative functions monitoring staffing and compensation levels and by applying technology to business processes to improve productivity where practical we review other general and administrative costs to identify efficiencies and savings opportunities in our operating divisions and our regional and corporate offices we also direct many of our promotional activities toward local real estate brokers and digital marketing initiatives which we believe are efficient uses of our marketing expenditures 

marketing and sales 

we primarily use the dr horton emerald homes express homes and freedom homes brand names to market and sell our homes our dr horton branded communities are the core of our business and account for the majority of our home closings focusing primarily on the first time and first time moveup homebuyer our emerald branded communities appeal to buyers in search of higherend moveup and luxury homes our express branded communities primarily accommodate a segment of entrylevel buyers who are focused on affordability we introduced our freedom homes brand in 2016 to offer homes at affordable price points to active adult buyers seeking a lowmaintenance lifestyle the percentage of home closings and home sales revenue contributed by each brand during fiscal 2019 was as follows 



we also use names of acquired companies for a period of time after the acquisition we currently utilize the pacific ridge homes brand in our seattle washington market the westport homes brand in our indianapolis and fort wayne indiana and columbus ohio markets and the terramor homes brand in our raleigh north carolina market the product offerings in all of these markets are similar to and included with our dr horton branded communities shown above 

we market and sell our homes primarily through commissioned employees and the majority of our home closings also involve an independent real estate broker we typically conduct home sales from sales offices located in furnished model homes in each subdivision and we generally do not offer our model homes for sale until the completion of a subdivision our sales personnel assist prospective homebuyers by providing floor plans and price information demonstrating the features and layouts of our homes and assisting with the selection of options when available we train and inform our sales personnel regarding construction schedules and marketing and advertising plans as market conditions warrant we may provide potential homebuyers with incentives such as discounts or free upgrades to be competitive in a particular market or to attain our targeted sales pace 

we market our homes and communities to prospective homebuyers and real estate brokers digitally through email search engine marketing social media and our company website and other real estate websites in addition to print media and advertisement we also use billboards radio television magazine and newspaper advertising locally as necessary we attempt to position our subdivisions in locations that are desirable to potential homebuyers and convenient to or visible from local traffic patterns which helps to reduce advertising costs model homes play an important role in our marketing efforts and we expend significant effort and resources to create an attractive atmosphere in our model homes 

we also build speculative homes in most of our communities which allow us to compete effectively with existing homes available in the market and improve our profits and returns these homes enhance our marketing and sales efforts to prospective homebuyers who are renters or who are relocating to these markets and require a home within a short time frame as well as to independent brokers who represent these homebuyers we determine our speculative homes strategy in each market based on local market factors such as new job growth the number of job relocations housing demand and supply seasonality current sales contract cancellation trends and our past experience in the market we maintain a level of speculative home inventory in each community based on our current and planned sales pace and we monitor and adjust speculative home inventory on an ongoing basis as conditions warrant 

sales contracts and backlog 

our sales contracts require an earnest money deposit which varies in amount across our markets and communities additionally customers are generally required to pay additional deposits when they select options or upgrade features for their homes our sales contracts include a financing contingency which permits customers to cancel and receive a refund of their deposit if they cannot obtain mortgage financing at prevailing or specified interest rates within a specified period our contracts may include other contingencies such as the sale of an existing home we either retain or refund customer deposits on cancelled sales contracts depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances 

sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period at september 30 2019  the value of our backlog of sales orders was 41 billion  13613 homes an increase of 3 from 40 billion  13371 homes at september 30 2018  the average sales price of homes in backlog was 304100 at september 30 2019  up slightly from the 301300 average at september 30 2018  many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies such as those described above which can result in cancellations as a percentage of gross sales orders cancellations of sales contracts were 21 in fiscal 2019 compared to 22 in fiscal 2018  

the length of time between the signing of a sales contract for a home and delivery of the home to the buyer closing is generally from two to six months  therefore substantially all of the homes in our sales backlog at september 30 2019 are scheduled to close in fiscal year 2020  

customer service and quality control 

our operating divisions are responsible for preclosing quality control inspections and responding to customers’ postclosing needs we believe that a prompt and courteous response to homebuyers’ needs during and after construction reduces postclosing repair costs enhances our reputation for quality and service and ultimately leads to repeat and referral business from the real estate community and homebuyers we typically provide our homebuyers with a tenyear limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems a twoyear limited warranty on major mechanical systems and a oneyear limited warranty on other construction components the subcontractors who perform the actual construction also provide us with warranties on workmanship and are generally prepared to respond to us and the homeowner promptly upon request in addition some of our suppliers provide manufacturer’s warranties on specified products installed in the home 

forestar residential lot development operations 

during fiscal 2018 we acquired 75 of the outstanding shares of forestar forestar is a residential lot development company with operations in 51 markets and 20 states as of september 30 2019  we owned approximately 66 of forestar’s outstanding common stock at september 30 2019  forestar is a component of our homebuilding strategy to enhance operational efficiency and returns by expanding relationships with land developers and increasing the portion of our land and lot position controlled under land purchase contracts to enhance operational efficiency and returns forestar is making significant investments in land acquisition and development to expand its residential lot development business across a geographically diversified national platform our homebuilding operations acquire finished lots from forestar in accordance with the master supply agreement between the two companies a shared services agreement is in place whereby we provide forestar certain administrative compliance operational and procurement services as the controlling shareholder of forestar we strongly influence the strategic direction and operations of forestar 

customer mortgage financing 

we provide mortgage financing services principally to purchasers of our homes in the majority of our homebuilding markets through dhi mortgage our 100 owned subsidiary dhi mortgage assists in the sales transaction by coordinating the mortgage application mortgage commitment and home closing processes to facilitate a timely and efficient home buying experience for our buyers during the year ended september 30 2019  dhi mortgage provided mortgage financing services for approximately 58 of our total homes closed and approximately 98 of dhi mortgage’s loan volume related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations most of our homebuilding divisions also work with additional mortgage lenders that offer a range of mortgage financing programs to our homebuyers 

to limit the risks associated with our mortgage operations dhi mortgage originates loan products that we believe can be sold to thirdparty purchasers of mortgage loans the majority of which are eligible for sale to the federal national mortgage association fannie mae the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac or the government national mortgage association ginnie mae dhi mortgage sells substantially all of the loans and their servicing rights to thirdparty purchasers shortly after origination with limited recourse provisions dhi mortgage centralizes most of its control and oversight functions including those related to loan underwriting quality control regulatory compliance secondary marketing of loans hedging activities accounting and financial reporting 

title services 

through our subsidiary title companies we serve as a title insurance agent in selected markets by providing title insurance policies examination and closing services primarily to our homebuilding customers we currently assume little or no underwriting risk associated with these title policies 

insurance agency 

through our insurance agency subsidiary we collect insurance commissions on homeowner policies placed with third party carriers 

multifamily rental properties 

through dhi communities a 100 owned subsidiary we develop construct and own multifamily residential properties that produce rental income dhi communities is primarily focused on constructing garden style multifamily products which typically accommodate 200 to 400 dwelling units in high growth suburban markets after dhi communities has completed construction and achieved a stabilized occupancy rate the property is typically marketed for sale we currently have four projects under active construction and two projects that are substantially complete one of which was under contract to sell at september 30 2019  during fiscal 2019 dhi communities sold two multifamily rental properties for 1334 million and recorded gains on sale totaling 519 million  at september 30 2019  dhi communities had total assets of 2040 million  which included property and equipment of 1539 million and other assets of 289 million for a property held for sale 

employees 

at september 30 2019  we employed 8916 persons of whom 1908 were sales and marketing personnel 2532 were involved in construction 2552 were office personnel and 1924 worked in mortgage and title operations we focus significant attention toward attracting and retaining talented and experienced individuals to manage and support our operations and we believe that we have good relations with our employees 

business acquisitions 

we routinely evaluate opportunities to profitably expand our operations including potential acquisitions of other homebuilding or related businesses acquisitions of homebuilding and related businesses usually provide us with immediate land and home inventories and control of additional land and lot positions through purchase contracts also employees of acquired businesses generally have specialized knowledge of local market conditions including existing relationships with municipalities land owners developers subcontractors and suppliers these inventory positions and local market knowledge and relationships could take us several years to develop through our own efforts we seek to limit the risks associated with acquiring other companies by conducting extensive operational financial and legal due diligence on each acquisition and by performing financial analysis to determine that each acquisition will have a positive impact on our earnings within an acceptable period of time 

during fiscal 2019 we acquired the homebuilding operations of westport homes classic builders and terramor homes for 3259 million  the assets acquired included approximately 700 homes in inventory 4500 lots and control of approximately 4300 additional lots through land purchase contracts we also acquired a sales order backlog of approximately 700 homes westport homes operates in indianapolis and fort wayne indiana and columbus ohio classic builders operates in des moines iowa and terramor homes operates in raleigh north carolina 

competition 

the homebuilding and lot development industries are highly competitive we compete with numerous other national regional and local homebuilders and developers for homebuyers desirable land raw materials skilled labor employees management talent and financing we also compete with resales of existing and foreclosed homes and with the rental housing market our homes compete on the basis of price location quality design and mortgage financing terms 

the competitors to our financial services businesses include other mortgage lenders and title companies including national regional and local mortgage bankers and other financial institutions some of these competitors are subject to fewer governmental regulations and may have greater access to capital and some of them may operate with different lending criteria and may offer a broader array of financing and other products and services to consumers than we do we strive to provide flexible fairly priced financing alternatives subject to applicable regulations 

governmental regulations and environmental matters 

the homebuilding industry is subject to extensive and complex regulations we and the subcontractors we use must comply with many federal state and local laws and regulations these include zoning density and development requirements and building environmental advertising labor and real estate sales rules and regulations these regulations and requirements affect substantially all aspects of our land development and home design construction and sales processes in varying degrees across our markets our homes are inspected by local authorities where required and homes eligible for insurance or guarantees provided by the federal housing administration fha and the department of veteran affairs va are subject to inspection by them these regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities in addition our new housing developments may be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets utilities and other public improvements 

our homebuilding and land development operations are also subject to an extensive array of local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning protection of health safety and the environment the particular compliance requirements for each site vary greatly according to location environmental condition and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties 

our mortgage company must comply with extensive state and federal laws and regulations which are administered by numerous agencies including but not limited to the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb federal housing finance agency us department of housing and urban development fha va united states department of agriculture usda fannie mae freddie mac and ginnie mae these laws and regulations include many compliance requirements including but not limited to licensing consumer disclosures fair lending and real estate settlement procedures as a result our operations are subject to regular extensive examinations by the applicable agencies 

seasonality 

although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again in the future we generally close more homes and generate greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year the seasonal nature of our business can also cause significant variations in our working capital requirements in our homebuilding land development and financial services operations as a result of seasonal activity our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year

risk factors 

tableend 

discussion of our business and operations included in this annual report on form 10k should be read together with the risk factors set forth below they describe various risks and uncertainties we are or may become subject to many of which are difficult to predict or beyond our control these risks and uncertainties together with other factors described elsewhere in this report have the potential to affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner 

the homebuilding and lot development industries are cyclical and affected by changes in economic real estate or other conditions that could adversely affect our business or financial results 

the homebuilding and lot development industries are cyclical and are significantly affected by changes in general and local economic and real estate conditions such as 

 

adverse changes in these general and local economic conditions or deterioration in the broader economy would cause a negative impact on our business and financial results and increase the risk for asset impairments and writeoffs changes in these economic conditions may affect some of our regions or markets more than others if adverse conditions affect our larger markets they could have a proportionately greater impact on us than on some other homebuilding companies 

in the past the federal government’s fiscal and trade policies and economic stimulus actions have created uncertainty in the financial markets and caused volatility in interest rates which impacted business and consumer behavior monetary policy actions affecting interest rates or fiscal policy actions and new legislation related to taxation spending levels or borrowing limits along with the related political debates conflicts and compromises associated with such actions may negatively impact the financial markets and consumer confidence such events could hurt the us economy and the housing market and in turn could adversely affect the operating results of our businesses 

weather conditions and natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes volcanic activity droughts and floods heavy or prolonged precipitation or wildfires can harm our business these can delay our development work home construction and home closings adversely affect the cost or availability of materials or labor or damage homes under construction the climates and geology of many of the states in which we operate including california florida texas and other coastal areas where we have some of our larger operations and which have experienced recent natural disasters present increased risks of adverse weather or natural disasters 

deployments of us military personnel to foreign regions terrorist attacks other acts of violence or threats to national security and any corresponding response by the united states or others related domestic or international instability or civil unrest may cause an economic slowdown in the markets where we operate which could adversely affect our business 

public health issues such as a major epidemic or pandemic could adversely affect our business the us and other countries have experienced and may experience in the future outbreaks of contagious diseases that affect public perception of health risk in the event of a widespread prolonged actual or perceived outbreak of a contagious disease our operations could be negatively impacted by a reduction in customer traffic or other factors which could reduce demand for new homes 

if we experience any of the foregoing potential customers may be less willing or able to buy our homes in the future our pricing and product strategies may also be limited by market conditions we may be unable to change the mix of our home offerings reduce the costs of the homes we build offer more affordable homes or satisfactorily address changing market conditions in other ways without adversely affecting our profits and returns in addition cancellations of home sales contracts in backlog may increase if homebuyers do not honor their contracts due to any of the factors discussed above 

our financial services business is closely related to our homebuilding business as it originates mortgage loans principally to purchasers of the homes we build a decrease in the demand for our homes because of the foregoing matters will also adversely affect the financial results of this segment of our business an increase in the default rate on the mortgages we originate may adversely affect our ability to sell the mortgages or the pricing we receive upon the sale of mortgages or may increase our recourse obligations for previous originations we may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to thirdparty purchasers in the event of errors or omissions relating to certain representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the type of collateral the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in the connection with the loan and we may be required to repurchase certain of those mortgage loans or provide indemnification repurchased mortgage loans andor the settlement of claims associated with such loans could adversely affect our business or financial results we establish reserves for estimated losses and future repurchase obligations for mortgage loans we have sold however actual future obligations related to these mortgages could differ significantly from our current estimated amounts 

constriction of the credit and public capital markets could limit our ability to access capital and increase our costs of capital 

during past economic and housing downturns the credit markets constricted and reduced some sources of liquidity that were previously available to us consequently we relied principally on our cash on hand to meet our working capital needs and repay outstanding indebtedness during those times there likely will be periods in the future when financial market upheaval will increase our cost of capital or limit our ability to access the public debt markets or obtain bank financing 

our homebuilding operations utilize a 159 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to 25 billion  subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments our homebuilding revolving credit facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit equal to 100 of the revolving credit commitment the maturity date of such facility is october 2 2024  forestar and its subsidiaries our financial services subsidiaries and certain of our other subsidiaries are not guarantors under our homebuilding revolving credit facility or our homebuilding senior notes 

forestar has a 380 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to 570 million  subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments the forestar revolving credit facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit equal to the greater of 100 million and 50 of the revolving credit commitment the maturity date of such facility is october 2 2022  the forestar revolving credit facility is guaranteed by forestar’s whollyowned subsidiaries that are not immaterial subsidiaries or have not been designated as unrestricted subsidiaries the forestar revolving credit facility is not guaranteed by us or our other subsidiaries 

our mortgage subsidiary utilizes a 900 million mortgage repurchase facility to finance the majority of the loans it originates the capacity of the facility increases without requiring additional commitments to 11 billion for approximately 45 days at fiscal year end the capacity can also be increased to 12 billion subject to the availability of additional commitments the mortgage repurchase facility must be renewed annually and currently expires on february 21 2020  we expect to renew and extend the term of the mortgage repurchase facility with similar terms prior to its maturity adverse changes in market conditions could make the renewal of these facilities more difficult or could result in an increase in the cost of these facilities or a decrease in the committed amounts such changes affecting our mortgage repurchase facility may also make it more difficult or costly to sell the mortgages that we originate 

we regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund growth in our business repay debt obligations and support other general corporate and operational needs and we regularly evaluate our opportunities to raise additional capital we have an automatically effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec in august 2018  registering debt and equity securities that we may issue from time to time in amounts to be determined also forestar has an effective shelf registration statement filed with the sec in september 2018  registering 500 million of equity securities of which 3943 million remains available as market conditions permit we may issue new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets or obtain additional bank financing to fund our projected capital requirements or provide additional liquidity we believe that our existing cash resources our homebuilding revolving credit facility our mortgage repurchase facility and our ability to access the capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our nearterm working capital needs and debt obligations including the maturity of 500 million aggregate principal amount of homebuilding senior notes in fiscal 2020  we believe that forestar’s existing cash resources together with borrowings under the forestar revolving credit facility and its ability to access the capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to fund its nearterm working capital needs including the maturity of its convertible senior notes in fiscal 2020  adverse changes in economic homebuilding or capital market conditions could negatively affect our business liquidity and financial results restrict our ability to obtain additional capital or increase our costs of capital 

reductions in the availability of mortgage financing provided by government agencies changes in government financing programs a decrease in our ability to sell mortgage loans on attractive terms or an increase in mortgage interest rates could decrease our buyers’ ability to obtain financing and adversely affect our business or financial results 

the mortgage loans originated by our financial services operations are primarily eligible for sale to fannie mae freddie mac and ginnie mae and are sold to thirdparty purchasers the secondary market for mortgage loans continues to primarily desire securities backed by fannie mae freddie mac or ginnie mae and we believe the liquidity these agencies provide to the mortgage industry is important to the housing market any significant change regarding the longterm structure and viability of fannie mae and freddie mac could result in adjustments to the size of their loan portfolios and to guidelines for their loan products additionally a reduction in the availability of financing provided by these institutions could adversely affect interest rates mortgage availability and sales of new homes and mortgage loans during fiscal 2019  approximately 93 of the mortgage loans sold by dhi mortgage were sold to four major financial entities the largest percentage of which purchased 32 of the total loans sold on an ongoing basis we seek to establish loan purchase arrangements with additional financial entities if we are unable to sell mortgage loans to purchasers on attractive terms our ability to originate and sell mortgage loans at competitive prices could be limited which would negatively affect our profitability 

the fha insures mortgage loans that generally have lower credit requirements and is an important source for financing the sale of our homes changes restrictions or significant premium increases in fha programs in the future may negatively affect the availability or affordability of fha financing which could adversely affect our ability to sell homes 

some of our customers may qualify for 100 financing through programs offered by the va usda and certain other housing finance agencies these programs are subject to changes in regulations lending standards and government funding levels there can be no assurances that these programs or other programs will continue to be available in our homebuilding markets or that they will be as attractive to our customers as the programs currently offered which could negatively affect our sales 

mortgage rates are currently low as compared to most historical periods however the federal reserve board could raise its benchmark rate when interest rates increase the cost of owning a home increases which will likely reduce the number of potential homebuyers who can obtain mortgage financing and could result in a decline in the demand for our homes 

the risks associated with our land and lot inventory could adversely affect our business or financial results 

inventory risks are substantial for our homebuilding and forestar businesses there are risks inherent in controlling owning and developing land if housing demand declines we may not be able to build and sell homes profitably in some of our communities and we may not be able to fully recover the costs of some of the land and lots we own also the values of our owned undeveloped land lots and housing inventories may fluctuate significantly due to changes in market conditions as a result our deposits for lots controlled under purchase contracts may be put at risk we may have to sell homes or land for a lower profit margin or record inventory impairment charges on our land and lots a significant deterioration in economic or homebuilding industry conditions may result in substantial inventory impairment charges 

we cannot make any assurances that our growth strategies acquisitions or investments will be successful or will not expose us to additional risks or other negative consequences 

in recent years we have primarily grown our business by increasing our investments in land lot and home inventories in our existing homebuilding markets we have also expanded through investments in new product offerings new geographic markets and the growth of our multifamily rental property operations investments in land lots home inventories and rental properties can expose us to risks of economic loss and asset impairments if housing conditions weaken or if we are unsuccessful in implementing our growth strategies 

on october 5 2017  we acquired 75 of the outstanding shares of forestar for 5583 million  pursuant to the terms of a merger agreement entered into in june 2017 and approved by a vote of forestar’s shareholders we currently own approximately 66 of the outstanding shares of forestar forestar is a publicly traded residential lot development company with operations in 51 markets and 20 states as of september 30 2019  forestar is making significant investments in land acquisition and development to expand its residential lot development business across a geographically diversified national platform our homebuilding divisions acquire finished lots from forestar in accordance with the master supply agreement between the two companies and we provide forestar certain administrative compliance operational and procurement services through a shared services agreement as the controlling shareholder of forestar we strongly influence the strategic direction and operations of forestar 

in addition to the investment and merger with forestar we have acquired the homebuilding operations of several homebuilding companies in recent years and we may make strategic acquisitions of or investments in other companies operations or assets in the future such acquisitions and investments may have risks similar to those related to land lots and home inventories but they may also expose us to additional risks or other negative consequences these transactions may not advance our business strategy provide a satisfactory return on our investment or provide other benefits we anticipate also the integration of these transactions may not be successful and may require significant time and resources which may divert management’s attention from other operations acquisitions and investments could also expose us to material liabilities not discovered in the due diligence process and may lead to litigation if these transactions underperform our expectations or are unsuccessful we may incur significant expenses or writeoffs of inventory other assets or intangible assets such as goodwill acquisitions and investments can result in dilution to existing stockholders if we issue our common stock as consideration and can increase our debt levels or reduce our liquidity if we purchase them with cash the magnitude timing and nature of any future acquisitions or investments will depend on a number of factors including our ability to identify suitable additional markets or acquisition candidates the negotiation of acceptable terms our financial position and general economic and business conditions we also may seek to divest an investment or a business and may have difficulty selling such investment or business on acceptable terms in a timely manner 

our business and financial results could be adversely affected by significant inflation higher interest rates or deflation 

inflation can adversely affect us by increasing costs of land materials and labor in addition significant inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates which have a negative impact on housing affordability in a highly inflationary environment depending on industry and other economic conditions we may be precluded from raising home prices enough to keep up with the rate of inflation which could reduce our profit margins moreover in a highly inflationary environment our cost of capital labor and materials can increase and the purchasing power of our cash resources can decline which could have an adverse impact on our business or financial results 

alternatively a significant period of deflation could cause a decrease in overall spending and borrowing levels this could lead to deterioration in economic conditions including an increase in the rate of unemployment deflation could also cause the value of our inventories to decline or reduce the value of existing homes below the related mortgage loan balance which could potentially increase the supply of existing homes if oil prices decline significantly economic conditions in markets that have significant exposure to the energy sector may weaken these or other factors that increase the risk of significant deflation could have a negative impact on our business or financial results 

homebuilding is subject to home warranty and construction defect claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant 

we are subject to home warranty and construction defect claims arising in the ordinary course of our homebuilding business we rely on subcontractors to perform the actual construction of our homes and in many cases to select and obtain construction materials despite our detailed specifications and monitoring of the construction process our subcontractors occasionally do not meet adequate quality standards in the construction of our homes when we find these issues we repair them in accordance with our warranty obligations we spend significant resources to repair items in homes we have sold to fulfill the warranties we issued to our homebuyers additionally we are subject to construction defect claims which can be costly to defend and resolve in the legal system warranty and construction defect matters can also result in negative publicity in the media and on the internet which can damage our reputation and adversely affect our ability to sell homes 

based on the large number of homes we have sold over the years our potential liabilities related to warranty and construction defect claims are significant as a consequence we maintain product liability insurance and we seek to obtain indemnities and certificates of insurance from subcontractors covering claims related to their workmanship and materials we establish warranty and other reserves for the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built because of the uncertainties inherent to these matters we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will be adequate to address all of our future warranty and construction defect claims contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce we may be responsible for applicable selfinsured retentions and some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits additionally the coverage offered by and the availability of product liability insurance for construction defects is limited and costly we have responded to increases in insurance costs and coverage limitations by increasing our selfinsured retentions and claim reserves there can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted or become more costly if costs to resolve our future warranty and construction defect claims exceed our estimates our financial results and liquidity could be adversely affected 

a health and safety incident relating to our operations could be costly in terms of potential liability and reputational damage 

  

building and land development sites are inherently dangerous and operating in the homebuilding and lot development industries poses certain inherent health and safety risks due to health and safety regulatory requirements and the number of homes we construct health and safety performance is critical to the success of our business any failure in health and safety performance may result in penalties for noncompliance with relevant regulatory requirements and a failure that results in a major or significant health and safety incident is likely to be costly and could expose us to liability that could be costly such an incident could generate significant negative publicity and have a corresponding impact on our reputation our relationships with relevant regulatory agencies or governmental authorities and our ability to attract customers and employees which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and liquidity 

damage to our corporate reputation or brands from negative publicity could adversely affect our business financial results andor stock price 

adverse publicity related to our company industry personnel operations or business performance may cause damage to our corporate reputation or brands and may generate negative sentiment potentially affecting the performance of our business or our stock price regardless of its accuracy or inaccuracy negative publicity can be disseminated rapidly through digital platforms including social media websites blogs and newsletters customers and other interested parties value readily available information and often act on such information without further investigation and without regard to its accuracy the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction 

and our success in preserving our brand image depends on our ability to recognize respond to and effectively manage negative publicity in a rapidly changing environment adverse publicity or unfavorable commentary from any source could damage our reputation reduce the demand for our homes or negatively impact the morale and performance of our employees which could adversely affect our business 

supply shortages and other risks related to acquiring land building materials and skilled labor could increase our costs and delay deliveries 

the homebuilding and lot development industries have from time to time experienced significant difficulties that can affect the cost or timing of construction including 

 

in addition tariffs duties andor trade restrictions imposed or increased on imported materials and goods that are used in connection with the construction and delivery of our homes including steel aluminum and lumber may raise our costs for these items or for the products made with them these factors may cause construction delays or cause us to incur more costs building our homes if the level of new home demand increases significantly in future periods the risk of shortages in residential lots labor and materials available to the homebuilding industry will likely increase 

we are required to obtain performance bonds the unavailability of which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

we often are required to provide surety bonds to secure our performance or obligations under construction contracts development agreements and other arrangements at september 30 2019  we had 17 billion of outstanding surety bonds our ability to obtain surety bonds primarily depends upon our credit rating financial condition past performance and other factors including the capacity of the surety market and the underwriting practices of surety bond issuers the ability to obtain surety bonds also can be impacted by the willingness of insurance companies to issue performance bonds for construction and development activities if we are unable to obtain surety bonds when required our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

increases in the costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business or financial results 

prior to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act tax act which was enacted into law on december 22 2017 significant expenses of owning a home including mortgage loan interest and state and local taxes generally were deductible expenses for an individual’s federal income taxes subject to various limitations the tax act established new limits on the federal tax deductions individual taxpayers may take on mortgage loan interest payments and on state and local taxes including property taxes these changes could reduce the actual or perceived affordability of homeownership which could adversely affect demand for and sales prices of new homes especially in areas with relatively high housing prices or high state and local income taxes and real estate taxes any further change in income tax laws by the federal or state government to eliminate or substantially reduce income tax benefits associated with homeownership could adversely affect demand for and sales prices of new homes 

in addition increases in property tax rates by local governmental authorities as experienced in some areas in response to reduced federal and state funding could adversely affect the amount of financing our potential customers could obtain or their desire to purchase new homes 

governmental regulations and environmental matters could increase the cost and limit the availability of our land development and homebuilding projects and adversely affect our business or financial results 

we are subject to extensive and complex regulations that affect land development and home construction including zoning density restrictions building design and building standards these regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities as to the conditions we must meet prior to development or construction being approved if approved at all we are subject to determinations by these authorities as to the adequacy of water or sewage facilities roads or other local services new housing developments may also be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets and other public improvements in addition in many markets government authorities have implemented no growth or growth control initiatives any of these may limit delay or increase the costs of development or home construction 

we are also subject to a significant number and variety of local state and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of health safety labor standards and the environment the impact of environmental laws varies depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available these matters may result in delays may cause us to incur substantial compliance remediation mitigation and other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas government agencies also routinely initiate audits reviews or investigations of our business practices to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations which can cause us to incur costs or create other disruptions in our business that can be significant for example we have received notices of violation from the united states environmental protection agency related to stormwater compliance at certain of our sites in our southeast region this matter could potentially result in requirements for us to perform additional compliance procedures and to pay monetary sanctions 

the subcontractors we rely on to perform the actual construction of our homes are also subject to a significant number of local state and federal laws and regulations including laws involving matters that are not within our control if the subcontractors who construct our homes fail to comply with all applicable laws we can suffer reputational damage and may be exposed to possible liability 

we are also subject to an extensive number of laws and regulations because our common stock and debt securities and the common stock of our forestar subsidiary are publicly traded in the capital markets these regulations govern our communications with our shareholders and the capital markets our financial statement disclosures and our legal processes and they also impact the work required to be performed by our independent registered public accounting firm and our legal counsel changes in these laws and regulations including the subsequent implementation of rules by the administering government authorities may require us to incur additional compliance costs and such costs may be significant 

governmental regulation of our financial services operations could adversely affect our business or financial results 

our financial services operations are subject to extensive state and federal laws and regulations which are administered by numerous agencies including but not limited to the cfpb federal housing finance agency us department of housing and urban development fha va usda fannie mae freddie mac and ginnie mae these laws and regulations include many compliance requirements including but not limited to licensing consumer disclosures fair lending and real estate settlement procedures as a result our operations are subject to regular extensive examinations by the applicable agencies 

in fiscal 2013 our mortgage subsidiary was subpoenaed by the united states department of justice doj regarding the adequacy of certain underwriting and quality control processes related to fha loans originated and sold in prior years we have provided information related to these loans and our processes to the doj and communications are ongoing the doj has to date not asserted any formal claim amount penalty or fine 

due to the significant increases in regulations in recent years operating costs have increased for our mortgage operations the possibility of additional future regulations changing rule interpretations and examinations by regulatory agencies may result in more stringent compliance standards and could adversely affect the results of our operations 

we have significant amounts of debt and may incur additional debt which could affect our financial health and our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations or potential acquisitions 

as of september 30 2019  our consolidated debt was 34 billion  which consisted of 20 billion related to our homebuilding segment 4629 million related to our forestar segment and 8889 million related to our financial services segment we had 16 billion principal amount of our debt maturing before the end of fiscal 2020  including 500 million principal amount of homebuilding senior notes 8889 million outstanding under the mortgage repurchase facility and 1189 million principal amount of forestar’s convertible senior notes the indentures governing our homebuilding senior notes do not restrict the incurrence of future unsecured debt by us or our homebuilding subsidiaries or the incurrence of secured or unsecured debt by our nonguarantor subsidiaries and the agreement governing our homebuilding revolving credit facility allows us to incur a substantial amount of future unsecured debt also the indentures governing our homebuilding senior notes and the agreement governing our homebuilding revolving credit facility impose restrictions on our ability and on that of the guarantors under our homebuilding senior notes and our homebuilding revolving credit facility to incur debt secured by certain assets but still permit us and our homebuilding subsidiaries to incur significant amounts of additional secured debt the forestar revolving credit facility and the indenture governing forestar’s senior notes impose restrictions on the ability of forestar and its restricted subsidiaries to incur secured and unsecured debt but still permit forestar and its subsidiaries to incur a substantial amount of future secured and unsecured debt and do not restrict the incurrence of future secured and unsecured debt by forestar’s unrestricted subsidiaries 

the amount and the maturities of our debt and the debt of our subsidiaries could have important consequences for example possible consequences for our homebuilding financial services and forestar operations each with respect to their individual debt obligations could 

 

servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash and we or our subsidiaries may not have sufficient cash flow from our respective businesses to pay our substantial debt 

our ability and that of our subsidiaries to meet our respective debt service obligations will depend in part upon our and our subsidiaries’ future financial performance future results are subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report our revenues and earnings vary with the level of general economic activity in the markets we serve our businesses are also affected by financial political business and other factors many of which are beyond our control the factors that affect our ability to generate cash can also affect our ability to raise additional funds for these purposes through the sale of debt or equity the refinancing of debt or the sale of assets changes in prevailing interest rates may affect the cost of our debt service obligations because borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and mortgage repurchase facility bear interest at floating rates 

the instruments governing our and our subsidiaries’ indebtedness impose certain restrictions on our and our subsidiaries’ business and the ability of us and our subsidiaries to comply with related covenants restrictions or limitations could adversely affect our and our subsidiaries’ financial condition or operating flexibility 

the restrictions imposed by our and certain of our subsidiaries’ indebtedness could limit our or our subsidiaries’ ability to plan for or react to market or economic conditions or meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans and adversely affect our or our subsidiaries’ ability to finance our operations acquisitions investments or strategic alliances or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest 

the agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on our and our guarantor subsidiaries’ ability to among other things engage in sale and leaseback transactions with respect to certain assets incur secured debt create liens pay dividends and make other distributions on or redeem or repurchase equity securities sell certain assets and engage in mergers consolidations or sales of all or substantially all of our assets the instruments governing forestar’s indebtedness contain restrictions on the ability of forestar and certain of its subsidiaries to among other things incur additional indebtedness create liens pay dividends and make other distributions on or redeem or repurchase equity securities sell certain assets enter into affiliate transactions and engage in mergers consolidations or sales of all or substantially all of forestar’s assets 

in addition the agreements governing certain of our and our subsidiaries’ debt instruments contain the following financial covenants 

homebuilding revolving credit facility our homebuilding revolving credit facility contains financial covenants requiring the maintenance of a maximum allowable leverage ratio and a borrowing base restriction if our leverage ratio exceeds a certain level a failure to comply with these financial covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under this revolving credit facility or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity 

forestar’s revolving credit facility the forestar revolving credit facility contains financial covenants requiring the maintenance by forestar of a minimum level of tangible net worth a minimum level of liquidity a maximum allowable leverage ratio and a borrowing base restriction based on the book value of forestar’s real estate assets and unrestricted cash a failure to comply with these financial covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under this revolving credit facility or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity 

mortgage repurchase facility and other restrictions the mortgage repurchase facility for our mortgage subsidiary requires the maintenance of a minimum level of tangible net worth a maximum allowable leverage ratio and a minimum level of liquidity by our mortgage subsidiary a failure to comply with these requirements could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds to our mortgage subsidiary or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity any difficulty experienced in complying with these covenants could make the renewal of the facility more difficult or costly 

in addition although our financial services business is conducted through subsidiaries that are not restricted by the indentures governing our senior notes or the agreements governing our revolving credit facilities the ability of our financial services subsidiaries to distribute funds to our homebuilding operations would be restricted in the event such distribution would cause an event of default under the mortgage repurchase facility or if an event of default had occurred under this facility moreover our right to receive assets from our financial services subsidiaries upon their liquidation or recapitalization is subject to the prior claims of the creditors of these subsidiaries any claims we may have to funds from our financial services subsidiaries would be subordinate to subsidiary indebtedness to the extent of any security for such indebtedness and to any indebtedness otherwise recognized as senior to our claims 

our access to capital and our ability to obtain additional financing could be affected by any downgrade of our debt ratings 

our homebuilding senior unsecured debt is currently rated investment grade by all three major rating agencies however there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain these ratings any lowering of our debt ratings could make accessing the public capital markets or obtaining additional credit from banks more difficult andor more expensive any lowering of forestar’s debt ratings could also make forestar’s ability to access the public capital markets or obtain additional credit from banks more difficult andor more expensive 

the instruments governing our indebtedness contain change of control provisions which could affect the timing of repayment 

change of control purchase options under our homebuilding senior notes and change of control default under our homebuilding revolving credit facility upon the occurrence of both a change of control and a ratings downgrade event each as defined in the indentures governing our homebuilding senior notes we will be required to offer to repurchase such notes at 101 of their principal amount together with all accrued and unpaid interest if any moreover a change of control as defined in our homebuilding revolving credit facility would constitute an event of default under our homebuilding revolving credit facility which could result in the acceleration of the repayment of any borrowings outstanding under the facility a requirement to cash collateralize all letters of credit outstanding thereunder and the termination of the commitments thereunder if repayment of more than 50 million outstanding under our homebuilding revolving credit facility were accelerated and such acceleration were not rescinded or such indebtedness were not satisfied in either case within 30 days an event of default would result under the indentures governing our homebuilding senior notes entitling the trustee for the notes or holders of at least 25 in principal amount of the relevant series of notes then outstanding to declare all such notes to be due and payable immediately if purchase offers were required under the indentures for our homebuilding senior notes repayment of the borrowings under our homebuilding revolving credit facility were required or if the senior notes were accelerated we can give no assurance that we would have sufficient funds to pay the required amounts 

change of control purchase option under forestar’s notes and change of control default under the forestar revolving credit facility upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event as defined in the indenture governing forestar’s notes forestar will be required to offer to repurchase forestar’s notes at 101 of their principal amount together with all accrued and unpaid interest if any a change of control as defined in the forestar revolving credit facility with respect to forestar would constitute an event of default under the forestar revolving credit facility which could result in the acceleration of the repayment of any borrowings outstanding under the facility a requirement to cash collateralize all letters of credit outstanding thereunder and the termination of the commitments thereunder if the maturity of the forestar revolving credit facility andor other indebtedness of forestar and its restricted subsidiaries together having an aggregate principal amount outstanding of 40 million or more is accelerated an event of default would result under the indenture governing the forestar notes entitling the trustee for the forestar notes or holders of at least 25 in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding forestar notes to declare all such forestar notes to be due and payable immediately if purchase offers were required under the indenture for forestar’s notes repayment of the borrowings under forestar’s revolving credit facility were required or if forestar’s notes were accelerated we can give no assurance that forestar would have sufficient funds to pay the required amounts 

homebuilding lot development and financial services are competitive industries and competitive conditions could adversely affect our business or financial results 

the homebuilding and lot development industries are highly competitive homebuilders compete not only for homebuyers but also for desirable properties financing raw materials and skilled labor we compete with local regional and national homebuilders and developers and also with existing home sales foreclosures and rental properties the competitive conditions in the homebuilding industry can negatively affect our sales volumes selling prices and incentive levels reduce our profit margins and cause the value of our inventory or other assets to be impaired competition can also affect our ability to acquire suitable land raw materials and skilled labor at acceptable prices or terms or cause delays in land development or in the construction of our homes 

the competitors to our financial services businesses include other title companies and mortgage lenders including national regional and local mortgage banks and other financial institutions some of these competitors are subject to fewer governmental regulations and have greater access to capital than we do and some of them may operate with different lending criteria than we do these competitors may offer a broader or more attractive array of financing and other products and services to potential customers than we do 

our businesses compete with other companies across all industries to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced employees managers and executives competition for the services of these individuals increases as business conditions improve in the homebuilding lot development and financial services industries and in the general economy if we are unable to attract and retain key employees managers or executives our business could be adversely affected 

our business could be adversely affected by the loss of key personnel 

we rely on our key personnel to effectively operate and manage our businesses specifically our success depends heavily on the performance of our homebuilding division and region presidents and their management teams our financial services management team our corporate office management teams our forestar management team and our executive officers these key personnel have significant experience and skills in the homebuilding land development and financial services industries as well as leadership and management abilities that are important to our success we seek to retain our key personnel and to have succession plans in place to address the potential loss of key personnel however if our retention and succession planning efforts are unsuccessful or if we fail to attract suitable replacements the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business 

information technology failures and data security breaches could harm our business 

we use information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational and marketing activities and to maintain our business records these information technology systems are dependent upon global communications providers web browsers thirdparty software and data storage providers and other aspects of the internet infrastructure that have experienced security breaches cyberattacks significant systems failures and service outages in the past a material breach in the security of our information technology systems or other data security controls could include the theft or release of customer employee or company data a data security breach a significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems or a breach of any of our data security controls could disrupt our business operations damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers adversely impact our sales and revenue and require us to incur significant expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve these kinds of issues the unintended or unauthorized public disclosure of personal identifying and confidential information related to our homebuyers employees vendors and suppliers as a result of a security breach could also lead to litigation or other proceedings against us by the affected individuals or business partners or by regulators the outcome of such proceedings which could include penalties or fines could have a significant negative impact on our business we may also be required to incur significant costs to protect against damages caused by information technology failures or security breaches in the future as legal requirements related to data security continue to increase we provide employee awareness training of cybersecurity threats and routinely utilize information technology security experts to assist us in our evaluations of the effectiveness of the security of our information technology systems and we regularly enhance our security measures to protect our systems and data we use various encryption tokenization and authentication technologies to mitigate cybersecurity risks and have increased our monitoring capabilities to enhance early detection and rapid response to potential cyber threats however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures consequently we cannot provide assurances that a security breach cyberattack data theft or other significant systems or security failures will not occur in the future and such occurrences could have a material and adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend 

results of operations — fiscal year 2019 overview 

sales prices for both new and resale homes have increased across most of our markets over the past several years which has generally reduced housing affordability during fiscal 2018 interest rates on mortgage loans increased which further impacted affordability these conditions resulted in some moderation of demand for new homes across most of our markets in late fiscal 2018 and early fiscal 2019 and in response we increased our sales incentives to improve sales pace later in fiscal 2019 interest rates on mortgage loans decreased and we reduced sales incentives as demand strengthened compared to earlier in the year we continue to see solid economic fundamentals and a limited supply of homes at affordable prices across most of our markets 

we believe our business is well positioned with a broad geographic footprint affordable product offerings a balanced supply of finished lots land and homes a strong balance sheet and liquidity position and experienced personnel across our operating markets we remain focused on growing our revenues and profitability generating consistently strong annual cash flows from operations and managing our product offerings pricing sales pace and inventory levels to optimize the return on our inventory investments 

in fiscal 2019  our number of homes closed and home sales revenues increased 10 and 9  respectively compared to the prior year our pretax income was 21 billion in both fiscal 2019 and 2018  our pretax operating margin was 121 in fiscal 2019 compared to 128 in fiscal 2018  cash provided by our homebuilding operations was 14 billion in fiscal 2019 compared to 10 billion in fiscal 2018  in fiscal 2019  our homebuilding return on inventory roi was 181 compared to 202 in fiscal 2018  homebuilding roi is calculated as homebuilding pretax income for the year divided by average inventory average inventory in the roi calculation is the sum of ending inventory balances for the trailing five quarters divided by five 

within our homebuilding land and lot portfolio our lots controlled under purchase contracts represent 60 of the lots owned and controlled at september 30 2019 compared to 57 at september 30 2018  growing our majorityowned forestar lot development operations is advancing our homebuilding strategy of increasing our controlled finished lot pipeline  

we believe that housing demand in our individual operating markets is tied closely to each market’s economy therefore we expect that housing market conditions will vary across our markets if the us economy continues to grow we expect to see solid housing demand concentrated in markets where job growth is occurring and new home prices remain affordable relative to household incomes the pace and sustainability of new home demand and our future results could be negatively affected by weakening economic conditions decreases in the level of employment and housing demand decreased home affordability increases in mortgage interest rates or tightening of mortgage lending standards 

strategy 

our operating strategy focuses on enhancing longterm value to our shareholders by leveraging our financial and competitive position in our core homebuilding business to increase the returns on our inventory investments and generate strong profitability and cash flows while managing risk and maintaining financial flexibility to make opportunistic strategic investments this strategy includes the following initiatives 

 

we believe our operating strategy which has produced positive results in recent years will allow us to maintain and improve our financial and competitive position and balance sheet strength however we cannot provide any assurances that the initiatives listed above will continue to be successful and we may need to adjust components of our strategy to meet future market conditions 

key results 

key financial results as of and for our fiscal year ended september 30 2019  as compared to fiscal 2018 or from the acquisition date of october 5 2017 through september 30 2018 for forestar’s results were as follows

consolidated results 



results of operations — homebuilding 

our operating segments are our 52 homebuilding divisions our majorityowned forestar lot development operations our financial services operations and our other business activities the homebuilding operating segments are aggregated into six reporting segments these reporting segments which we also refer to as reporting regions have homebuilding operations located in the following states 



the following tables and related discussion set forth key operating and financial data for our homebuilding operations by reporting segment as of and for the fiscal years ended september 30 2019 and 2018  for similar operating and financial data and discussion of our fiscal 2018 results compared to our fiscal 2017 results refer to item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under part ii of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended september 30 2018  which was filed with the sec on november 16 2018 



 

 



 



net sales orders 

the number of net sales orders increased 7 during 2019 compared to 2018  with increases in most of our regions the value of net sales orders increased 7 to 168 billion  56565 homes in 2019 from 158 billion  52740 homes in 2018  the average selling price of homes sold during fiscal 2019 was 297800  essentially unchanged from the prior year 

higher sales volumes in our east and midwest regions reflect our acquisitions of the homebuilding operations of terramor homes westport homes and classic builders in early fiscal 2019 which added 262 net sales orders to the east region’s results and 1199 net sales orders to the midwest regions results lower sales volume in our southwest region during 2019 was due to a decrease in sales orders in our phoenix market our sales order cancellation rate cancelled sales orders divided by gross sales orders for the period was 21 in 2019 compared to 22 in 2018  

we believe our business is well positioned to continue to generate increased sales volume however our future sales volumes will depend on new home demand in each of our operating markets and our ability to successfully implement our operating strategies 



sales order backlog 

sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies including mortgage loan approval and buyers selling their existing homes which can result in cancellations a portion of the contracts in backlog will not result in closings due to cancellations 



home sales revenue 

revenues from home sales increased 9 to 169 billion   56975 homes closed in 2019 from 155 billion   51857 homes closed in 2018  home sales revenues increased in most of our regions primarily due to an increase in the number of homes closed 

the number of homes closed in fiscal 2019 increased 10 from 2018  the increases in our east and midwest regions reflect our acquisitions of the homebuilding operations of terramor homes westport homes and classic builders in early fiscal 2019 which added 266 closings to the east region’s results and 1157 closings to the midwest regions results lower home closings volume in our southwest region during 2019 was due to a decrease in closings in our phoenix market the average selling price of homes closed during fiscal 2019 was 297100  down slightly from the prior year decreases in the average selling price of homes closed in the midwest and west regions were largely offset by an increase in the average selling price in the southwest region 

homebuilding operating margin analysis 



home sales gross profit 

gross profit from home sales increased 4 to 34 billion in 2019 from 33 billion in 2018 and decreased 110 basis points to 202 as a percentage of home sales revenues the percentage decrease resulted from decreases of 130 basis points due to the average selling price of our homes closed decreasing while the average cost increased and 10 basis points from an increase in the amount of purchase accounting adjustments for recent acquisitions partially offset by improvements of 20 basis points due to a reduction in warranty and construction defect expenses and 10 basis points due to a decrease in the amortization of capitalized interest 

we remain focused on managing the pricing incentives and sales pace in each of our communities to optimize the returns on our inventory investments and adjust to local market conditions and new home demand these actions could cause our gross profit margins to fluctuate in future periods 

landlot sales and other revenues 

land sales and other revenues from our homebuilding operations were 919 million and 1218 million in fiscal 2019 and 2018  respectively we continually evaluate our land and lot supply and fluctuations in revenues and profitability from land sales occur based on how we manage our inventory levels in various markets we generally purchase land and lots with the intent to build and sell homes on them however some of the land that we purchase includes commercially zoned parcels that we may sell to commercial developers we may also sell residential lots or land parcels to manage our supply or for other strategic reasons as of september 30 2019  our homebuilding operations had 198 million of land held for sale that we expect to sell in the next twelve months 

inventory and land option charges 

at the end of each quarter during fiscal 2019  we reviewed the performance and outlook for all of our communities and land inventories for indicators of potential impairment and performed detailed impairment evaluations and analyses when necessary as of september 30 2019  we performed detailed impairment evaluations of communities and land inventories with a combined carrying value of 550 million and recorded impairment charges of 63 million during the fourth quarter to reduce the carrying value of impaired communities to fair value total homebuilding impairment charges during fiscal 2019 and 2018 were 249 million and 109 million  respectively 

as we manage our inventory investments across our operating markets to optimize returns and cash flows we may modify our pricing and incentives construction and development plans or land sale strategies in individual active communities and land held for development which could result in the affected communities being evaluated for potential impairment also if housing or economic conditions weaken in specific markets in which we operate or if conditions weaken in the broader economy or homebuilding industry we may be required to evaluate additional communities for potential impairment these evaluations could result in additional impairment charges 

during fiscal 2019 and 2018  earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs related to land purchase contracts that we have terminated or expect to terminate were 283 million and 134 million  respectively total inventory and land option charges for fiscal 2018 also included a charge of 245 million related to the settlement of an outstanding dispute associated with a land transaction 

selling general and administrative sga expense 

sga expense from homebuilding activities increased 10 to 15 billion in fiscal 2019 from 13 billion in fiscal 2018  sga expense as a percentage of homebuilding revenues was 87 and 86 in fiscal 2019 and 2018  respectively 

employee compensation and related costs represented 72 of sga costs in both fiscal 2019 and 2018  these costs increased 11 to 11 billion in 2019 from 9642 million in 2018 due to an increase in the number of employees as compared to the prior year our homebuilding operations employed 6810 and 6419 employees at september 30 2019 and 2018  respectively 

we attempt to control our sga costs while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports our operations however we cannot make assurances that we will be able to maintain or improve upon the current sga expense as a percentage of revenues 

interest incurred 

we capitalize interest costs incurred to inventory during active development and construction active inventory capitalized interest is charged to cost of sales as the related inventory is delivered to the buyer interest incurred by our homebuilding operations decreased 5 to 1047 million in fiscal 2019 from 1099 million in fiscal 2018  the decrease was due to a decrease in our average homebuilding debt in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior year interest charged to cost of sales was 09 and 11 of total cost of sales excluding inventory and land option charges in fiscal 2019 and 2018  respectively 

gain on sale of assets 

gain on sale of assets from our homebuilding operations was 20 million in fiscal 2019 compared to 158 million in fiscal 2018  the higher gain on sale during the prior year primarily resulted from the sale of rental units in our homebuilding segment’s southeast region

results of operations — financial services 

the following tables and related discussion set forth key operating and financial data for our financial services operations comprising dhi mortgage and our subsidiary title companies for the fiscal years ended september 30 2019 and 2018  





financial services operating margin analysis 



mortgage loan activity 

the volume of loans originated by our mortgage operations is directly related to the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations in fiscal 2019  the volume of firstlien loans originated or brokered by dhi mortgage for our homebuyers increased 13 from the prior year primarily as a result of an increase in the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations of 10  the percentage of homes closed for which dhi mortgage handled the homebuyers’ financing was 58 and 56 in fiscal 2019 and 2018  respectively 

homes closed by our homebuilding operations constituted 98 and 97 of dhi mortgage loan originations in fiscal 2019 and 2018  respectively these percentages reflect dhi mortgage’s consistent focus on the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations 

the number of loans sold increased 13 in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior year virtually all of the mortgage loans held for sale on september 30 2019 were eligible for sale to fannie mae freddie mac or ginnie mae approximately 93 of the mortgage loans sold by dhi mortgage during fiscal 2019 were sold to four major financial entities the largest of which purchased 32 of the total loans sold 

financial services revenues and expenses 

revenues from our mortgage operations increased 19 to 3555 million in fiscal 2019 from 2988 million in fiscal 2018  while the number of loan originations increased 12 over that same period revenues increased at a higher rate than origination volume primarily due to improved loan sale execution in the secondary market 

our mortgage operations revenues were reduced by 08 million and 13 million in fiscal 2019 and 2018  respectively to increase our loss reserves for estimated future recourse obligations and other mortgage loans and to adjust certain mortgage loans held for sale to fair value our loss reserves for loan recourse obligations are estimated based upon analysis of the volume of mortgages originated loan repurchase requests received actual repurchases and losses through the disposition of such loans or requests and discussions with our mortgage purchasers actual losses on mortgage loans may differ from our estimates which may result in future changes to our loss reserves 

general and administrative ga expense related to financial services operations increased 7 to 2930 million in fiscal 2019 from 2726 million in the prior year the increase was primarily due to an increase in employee related costs our financial services operations employed 1924 and 1919 employees at september 30 2019 and 2018  respectively 

as a percentage of financial services revenues ga expense was 663 in fiscal 2019 compared to 726 in the prior year the lower percentage in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to improved loan sale execution on mortgage loan originations and increased mortgage loan origination volume allowing us to better leverage ga expenses 

fluctuations in financial services ga expense as a percentage of revenues can be expected to occur as some components of revenue may fluctuate differently than loan volumes and some expenses are not directly related to mortgage loan volume or to changes in the amount of revenue earned 

other income net of other expense included in our financial services operations consists primarily of the interest income of our mortgage subsidiary 

results of operations — other businesses

results of operations — consolidated 

income before income taxes 

pretax income was 21 billion in both fiscal 2019 and 2018  in fiscal 2019  our homebuilding financial services and other businesses generated pretax income of 19 billion  1663 million and 555 million  respectively in fiscal 2018  our homebuilding and financial services businesses generated pretax income of 20 billion and 1178 million  respectively 

income taxes 

our income tax expense was 5067 million and 5977 million in fiscal 2019 and 2018  respectively and our effective tax rate was 238 and 290 in those years the effective tax rates reflect the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act tax act which was enacted into law in december 2017  the tax act reduced the federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 for all corporations effective january 1 2018 for fiscal year companies the change in law required the application of a blended tax rate in the year of change which for us was 245 for the fiscal year ended september 30 2018 for the fiscal year ended september 30 2019 and thereafter the applicable statutory federal tax rate is 21  the tax act also repealed the domestic production activities deduction effective for us beginning october 1 2018 the effective tax rates also include a tax benefit related to stockbased compensation and an expense for state income taxes 

the fiscal year 2018 effective tax rate also included the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the tax act the release of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets related to forestar and the enactment of the bipartisan budget act of 2018 which retroactively extended the expiration date of the federal energy efficient home credit from december 31 2016 until december 31 2017 

our deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities were 1818 million at september 30 2019 compared to 2117 million at september 30 2018  we have a valuation allowance related to state deferred tax assets for net operating loss nol carryforwards of 187 million at september 30 2019 and 177 million at september 30 2018 related to state deferred tax assets for nol carryforwards that are more likely than not to expire before being realized we will continue to evaluate both the positive and negative evidence in determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to our remaining state nol carryforwards any reversal of the valuation allowance in future periods will impact our effective tax rate 

dr horton has 164 million of tax benefits for state nol carryforwards that expire at various times depending on the tax jurisdiction of the total amount 62 million of the tax benefits expire over the next ten years and the remaining 102 million expires from fiscal years 2030 to 2039 

forestar has 114 million of tax benefits for federal nol carryforwards which have no expiration date additionally forestar has 37 million of tax benefits for state nol carryforwards that expire at various times depending on the tax jurisdiction 

the accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future results could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position also changes in existing federal and state tax laws and tax rates could affect future tax results and the valuation of our deferred tax assets 

dr horton is subject to federal income tax and state income tax in multiple jurisdictions the statute of limitations for dr horton’s major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for fiscal years 2016 through 2019 dr horton is currently being audited by various states however to date we are not aware of any significant findings identified by the taxing authorities 

forestar is subject to federal income tax and state income tax in multiple jurisdictions the federal statute of limitations for tax years prior to 2017 is effectively closed the statute of limitations in major state jurisdictions for tax years prior to 2015 is closed the internal revenue service recently completed an audit of forestar’s 2016 tax year with no changes forestar is not currently being audited by any state jurisdictions 

capital resources and liquidity 

we have historically funded our operations with cash flows from operating activities borrowings under bank credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities our current levels of cash borrowing capacity and balance sheet leverage provide us with the operational flexibility to adjust to changes in market conditions to increase our investments in homes finished lots land and land development to expand our operations and grow our revenues and profitability as well as to consider opportunistic strategic investments as they arise 

at september 30 2019  our ratio of debt to total capital notes payable divided by stockholders’ equity plus notes payable was 253 compared to 263 at september 30 2018  our ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital homebuilding notes payable divided by stockholders’ equity plus homebuilding notes payable was 170 compared to 214 at september 30 2018  over the long term we intend to maintain our ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital below 35  and we expect it to remain significantly lower than 35 throughout fiscal 2020  we believe that the ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital is useful in understanding the leverage employed in our homebuilding operations and comparing our capital structure with other homebuilders we exclude the debt of forestar and our financial services business because they are separately capitalized and not guaranteed by our parent company or any of our homebuilding entities 

we regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund growth in our business repay debt obligations pay dividends repurchase our common stock and support other general corporate and operational needs and we regularly evaluate our opportunities to raise additional capital dr horton has an automatically effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec in august 2018  registering debt and equity securities that may be issued from time to time in amounts to be determined forestar also has an effective shelf registration statement filed with the sec in september 2018  registering 500 million of equity securities of which 3943 million remains available as market conditions permit we may issue new debt or equity securities through the capital markets or obtain additional bank financing to fund our projected capital requirements or provide additional liquidity we believe that our existing cash resources revolving credit facilities mortgage repurchase facility and ability to access the capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our nearterm working capital needs and debt obligations including the maturity of 500 million principal amount of homebuilding senior notes and 1189 million principal amount of forestar’s convertible senior notes in fiscal 2020

in fiscal 2019  net cash used in investing activities was 3940 million compared to cash provided by investing activities of 190 million in fiscal 2018  in fiscal 2019  we paid 3158 million to purchase the homebuilding operations of westport homes classic builders and terramor homes proceeds from the sale of assets in fiscal 2019 included 1334 million related to the sale of two multifamily rental properties constructed by dhi communities in fiscal 2018  we paid 5583 million to purchase 75 of the outstanding shares of forestar which had 4019 million of cash on the acquisition date proceeds from the sale of assets in fiscal 2018 included 2583 million related to forestar primarily from the strategic sale of assets 

financing cash flow activities 

we expect the shortterm financing needs of our operations will be funded with existing cash cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities longterm financing needs for the growth of our homebuilding and forestar operations may be funded with the issuance of senior unsecured debt securities or equity securities through the capital markets 

in fiscal 2019  net cash used in financing activities was 4901 million  consisting primarily of note repayments repurchases of common stock and payments of cash dividends largely offset by note proceeds note repayments of 27 billion included repayments of amounts drawn on our revolving credit facilities of 22 billion and repayment of 500 million principal amount of our 375 homebuilding senior notes at maturity we also used cash of 4798 million to repurchase 119 million shares of our common stock and used 2234 million to pay dividends to our common stockholders note proceeds of 25 billion included draws of 22 billion on our revolving credit facilities and forestar’s issuance of 350 million principal amount of 80 senior notes due april 2024  our financial services segment received proceeds of 2512 million from net advances under its mortgage repurchase facility additionally forestar’s issuance of common stock resulted in 1007 million of cash proceeds 

in fiscal 2018  net cash used in financing activities was 825 million  consisting primarily of note repayments payments of cash dividends and repurchases of common stock largely offset by note proceeds note repayments of 22 billion included repayments of amounts drawn on our homebuilding revolving credit facility of 18 billion and our early redemption of 400 million principal amount of our 3625 senior notes due february 2018 we also used cash of 1884 million to pay dividends to our common stockholders and used 1275 million to repurchase 28 million shares of our common stock note proceeds of 22 billion included draws of 18 billion on our homebuilding revolving credit facility and our issuance of 400 million principal amount of 255 senior notes due december 2020  our financial services segment received proceeds of 2177 million from net advances under its mortgage repurchase facility 

our board of directors approved and paid quarterly cash dividends of 015 per common share in fiscal 2019 and 0125 per common share in fiscal 2018  in november 2019  our board of directors approved a cash dividend of 0175 per common share payable on december 11 2019  to stockholders of record on november 27 2019  the declaration of future cash dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon among other things our future earnings cash flows capital requirements financial condition and general business conditions 

contractual cash obligations commercial commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

our primary contractual cash obligations are payments under our debt agreements and lease payments under operating leases we expect to fund our contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business through a combination of our existing cash resources cash flows generated from profits our credit facilities or other bank financing and the issuance of new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets as market conditions may permit 

our future cash requirements for contractual obligations as of september 30 2019 are presented below 



 

 

at september 30 2019  we had outstanding letters of credit of 1717 million and surety bonds of 17 billion  issued by third parties to secure performance under various contracts we expect that our performance obligations secured by these letters of credit and bonds will generally be completed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms when we complete our performance obligations the related letters of credit and bonds are generally released shortly thereafter leaving us with no continuing obligations we have no material thirdparty guarantees 

our mortgage subsidiary enters into various commitments related to the lending activities of our mortgage operations further discussion of these commitments is provided in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” under part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

seasonality 

although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again in the future we generally close more homes and generate greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year the seasonal nature of our business can also cause significant variations in our working capital requirements in our homebuilding land development and financial services operations as a result of seasonal activity our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year 

inflation 

we may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation primarily because of higher financing land labor and material construction costs we attempt to offset cost increases in one component with savings in another and we increase our sales prices and reduce customer sales incentives when housing market conditions permit however during periods when housing market conditions are challenging we may not be able to offset cost increases with higher selling prices in addition higher mortgage interest rates reduce the affordability of our homes to prospective homebuyers

critical accounting policies 

general  — a comprehensive enumeration of the significant accounting policies of dr horton inc and subsidiaries is presented in note a to the accompanying financial statements as of september 30 2019 and 2018  and for the years ended september 30 2019  2018 and 2017  each of our accounting policies has been chosen based upon current authoritative literature that collectively comprises us generally accepted accounting principles gaap in instances where alternative methods of accounting are permissible under gaap we have chosen the method that most appropriately reflects the nature of our business the results of our operations and our financial condition and have consistently applied those methods over each of the periods presented in the financial statements the audit committee of our board of directors has reviewed and approved the accounting policies selected 

revenue recognition  — we generally recognize homebuilding revenue and related profit at the time of the closing of a sale when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer our performance obligation to deliver the agreedupon home is generally satisfied in less than one year from the original contract date proceeds from home closings held for our benefit at title companies are included in homebuilding cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets 

when we execute sales contracts with our homebuyers or when we require advance payment from homebuyers for custom changes upgrades or options related to their homes we record the cash deposits received as liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are cancelled we either retain or refund to the homebuyer deposits on cancelled sales contracts depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances 

we rarely purchase land for resale but periodically may elect to sell parcels of land that no longer fit into our strategic operating plans revenue from land sales is typically recognized on the closing date which is generally when performance obligations are satisfied 

we recognize financial services revenues associated with our title operations as closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued both of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed we transfer substantially all underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies to thirdparty insurers revenues associated with our mortgage operations primarily include net gains on the sale of mortgage loans and servicing rights we typically elect the fair value option for our mortgage loan originations whereby mortgage loans held for sale are recorded at fair value based on either sale commitments or current market quotes and loan values are adjusted through revenues for subsequent changes in fair value until the loans are sold expected gains and losses from the sale of servicing rights are included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through revenues at the time of commitment we sell substantially all of the mortgages we originate and the related servicing rights to thirdparty purchasers interest income is earned from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold 

mortgage loans are sold with limited recourse provisions which can result in repurchases of loans previously sold to investors or payments to reimburse investors for loan losses based on historical experience discussions with our mortgage purchasers analysis of the volume of mortgages we originated and current housing and credit market conditions we estimate and record a loss reserve for mortgage loans held in portfolio and mortgage loans held for sale as well as known and projected mortgage loan repurchase requests 

we collect insurance commissions on homeowner policies placed with third party carriers through our 100 owned insurance agency we recognize revenue and a contract asset for estimated future renewals of these policies upon issuance of the initial policy the date at which the performance obligation is satisfied 

inventories and cost of sales  — inventory includes the costs of direct land acquisition land development and home construction capitalized interest real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and home construction costs that we incur after development projects or homes are substantially complete such as utilities maintenance and cleaning are charged to sga expense as incurred all indirect overhead costs such as compensation of sales personnel division and region management and the costs of advertising and builder’s risk insurance are charged to sga expense as incurred 

land and development costs are typically allocated to individual residential lots on a prorata basis and the costs of residential lots are transferred to construction in progress when home construction begins home construction costs are specifically identified and recorded to individual homes cost of sales for homes closed includes the specific construction costs of each home and all applicable land acquisition land development and related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred allocated to each residential lot based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each community cost of sales for lots sold includes all applicable land acquisition land development and related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred allocated to each residential lot in the community any changes to the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial home or lot closings in a community are generally allocated on a prorata basis to the remaining homes or lots in the community associated with the relevant development activity 

when a home is closed we generally have not paid all incurred costs necessary to complete the home we record a liability and a charge to cost of sales for the amount estimated to ultimately be paid related to completed homes that have been closed we compare our home construction budgets to actual recorded costs to determine the additional costs remaining to be paid on each closed home we monitor the accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on closed homes in subsequent months to the amounts previously accrued although actual costs to be paid in the future on previously closed homes could differ from our current accruals such differences have not been significant 

each quarter we review our communities and land inventories for indicators of potential impairment we generally review our inventory for impairment indicators at the community level and the inventory within each community is categorized as land held for development residential land and lots developed and under development land held for sale and construction in progress and finished homes based on the stage of production or plans for future development or sale a particular community often includes inventory in more than one category in certain situations inventory may be analyzed separately for impairment purposes based on its product type or future plans in reviewing each of our communities we determine if impairment indicators exist on inventory held and used by analyzing a variety of factors including but not limited to the following 

 

if indicators of impairment are present for a community we perform an impairment evaluation of the community which includes an analysis to determine if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts if so impairment charges are recorded to cost of sales if the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying amounts these estimates of cash flows are significantly impacted by community specific factors including estimates of the amounts and timing of future revenues and estimates of the amount of land development materials and labor costs which in turn may be impacted by the following local market conditions 



for those assets deemed to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets our determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams when an impairment charge for a community is determined the charge is then allocated to each lot in the community in the same manner as land and development costs are allocated to each lot impairment charges are also recorded on finished homes in substantially completed communities when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values are greater than the fair values less estimated costs to sell these homes 

for the inventory impairment analyses performed during fiscal 2019  we assumed that for the majority of communities sales prices in future periods will be equal to or lower than current sales order prices in each community or in comparable communities in order to generate an acceptable absorption rate the remaining lives of the communities evaluated were estimated to be in a range from one month to five years  and we utilized a range of discount rates for communities from 12 to 18  

we rarely purchase land for resale however when we own land or communities under development that do not fit into our development and construction plans and we determine that we will sell the asset the project is accounted for as land held for sale if certain criteria are met we record land held for sale at the lesser of its carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell in performing the impairment evaluation for land held for sale we consider several factors including but not limited to recent offers received to purchase the property prices for land in recent comparable sales transactions and market analysis studies which include the estimated price a willing buyer would pay for the land if the estimated fair value less costs to sell an asset is less than the current carrying value the asset is written down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell 

the key assumptions relating to inventory valuations are impacted by local market and economic conditions and are inherently uncertain although our quarterly assessments reflect management’s best estimates due to uncertainties in the estimation process actual results could differ from such estimates 

warranty claims  — we typically provide our homebuyers with a tenyear limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems a twoyear limited warranty on major mechanical systems and a oneyear limited warranty on other construction components since we subcontract our construction work to subcontractors who typically provide us with an indemnity and a certificate of insurance prior to receiving payments for their work claims relating to workmanship and materials are generally the primary responsibility of the subcontractors warranty liabilities have been established by charging cost of sales for each home delivered the amounts charged are based on management’s estimate of expected warrantyrelated costs under all unexpired warranty obligation periods our warranty liability is based upon historical warranty cost experience in each market in which we operate and is adjusted to reflect qualitative risks associated with the types of homes we build and the geographic areas in which we build them actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts a 10 change in the historical warranty rates used to estimate our warranty accrual would not result in a material change in our accrual 

legal claims and insurance  — we are named as a defendant in various claims complaints and other legal actions in the ordinary course of business at any point in time we are managing several hundred individual claims related to construction defect matters personal injury claims employment matters land development issues contract disputes and other matters we have established reserves for these contingencies based on the estimated costs of pending claims and the estimated costs of anticipated future claims related to previously closed homes approximately 99 of these reserves related to construction defect matters at both september 30 2019 and 2018  

our reserves for construction defect claims include the estimated costs of both known claims and anticipated future claims at september 30 2019 and 2018  we had reserves for approximately 180 and 155 pending construction defect claims respectively and no individual existing claim was material to our financial statements during fiscal 2019  we established reserves for approximately 110 new construction defect claims and resolved 85 construction defect claims for a total cost of 179 million  we have closed a significant number of homes during recent years and we may be subject to future construction defect claims on these homes although regulations vary from state to state construction defect issues can generally be reported for up to ten years after the home has closed in many states in which we operate historical data and trends regarding the frequency of claims incurred and the costs to resolve claims relative to the types of products and markets where we operate are used to estimate the construction defect liabilities for both existing and 

anticipated future claims these estimates are subject to ongoing revision as the circumstances of individual pending claims and historical data and trends change adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the accounting period in which the change in estimate occurs 

historical trends in construction defect claims have been inconsistent and we believe they may continue to fluctuate we also believe that fluctuations in housing market conditions can affect the frequency and cost of construction defect claims if the ultimate resolution of construction defect claims resulting from our home closings in prior years varies from current expectations it could significantly change our estimates regarding the frequency and timing of claims incurred and the costs to resolve existing and anticipated future claims which would impact the construction defect reserves in the future if the frequency of claims incurred or costs of existing and future legal claims significantly exceed our current estimates they will have a significant negative impact on our future earnings and liquidity 

we estimate and record receivables under the applicable insurance policies related to our estimated contingencies for known claims and anticipated future construction defect claims on previously closed homes and other legal claims and lawsuits incurred in the ordinary course of business when recovery is probable additionally we may have the ability to recover a portion of our losses from our subcontractors and their insurance carriers when we have been named as an additional insured on their insurance policies 

the estimation of losses related to these reserves and the related estimates of recoveries from insurance policies are subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends in construction defect claims relative to our markets and the types of products built claim frequency claim settlement costs and patterns insurance industry practices and legal interpretations among others due to the high degree of judgment required in establishing reserves for these contingencies actual future costs and recoveries from insurance could differ significantly from current estimated amounts a 10 increase in the claim frequency and the average cost per claim used to estimate the reserves would result in an increase of approximately 737 million in our reserves and a 353 million increase in our receivable resulting in additional expense of 384 million  a 10 decrease in the claim frequency and the average cost per claim would result in a decrease of approximately 663 million in our reserves and a 279 million decrease in our receivable resulting in a reduction in expense of 384 million  

pending accounting pronouncements 

in february 2016 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201602 “leases” which requires that lease assets and liabilities be recognized on the balance sheet and that key information about leasing arrangements be disclosed the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2019 and will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in june 2016 the fasb issued asu 201613 “financial instruments  credit losses” which replaces the current incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information in determining credit loss estimates the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2020 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in january 2017 the fasb issued asu 201704 “intangibles  goodwill and other” which simplifies the measurement of goodwill impairment by removing the second step of the goodwill impairment test and requires the determination of the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit under the new guidance goodwill impairment is measured as the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value with the loss recognized limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2020 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

we are subject to interest rate risk on our longterm debt we monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and utilize both fixed and variable rate debt for fixed rate debt changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows conversely for variable rate debt changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument but may affect our future earnings and cash flows except in very limited circumstances we do not have an obligation to prepay fixedrate debt prior to maturity and as a result interest rate risk and changes in fair value would not have a significant impact on our cash flows related to our fixedrate debt until such time as we are required to refinance repurchase or repay such debt 

we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with our mortgage loan origination services we manage interest rate risk through the use of forward sales of mortgagebacked securities mbs which are referred to as “hedging instruments” in the following discussion we do not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate lock commitments irlcs are extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and who meet defined credit and underwriting criteria typically the irlcs have a duration of less than six months some irlcs are committed immediately to a specific purchaser through the use of bestefforts whole loan delivery commitments while other irlcs are funded prior to being committed to thirdparty purchasers the hedging instruments related to irlcs are classified and accounted for as derivative instruments in an economic hedge with gains and losses recognized in revenues in the consolidated statements of operations hedging instruments related to funded uncommitted loans are accounted for at fair value with changes recognized in revenues in the consolidated statements of operations along with changes in the fair value of the funded uncommitted loans the fair value change related to the hedging instruments generally offsets the fair value change in the uncommitted loans the net fair value change which for the years ended september 30 2019 and 2018 was not significant is recognized in current earnings at september 30 2019  hedging instruments used to mitigate interest rate risk related to uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale and uncommitted irlcs totaled a notional amount of 13 billion  uncommitted irlcs totaled a notional amount of approximately 7027 million and uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale totaled a notional amount of approximately 6638 million at september 30 2019  

from time to time we enter into forward sales of mbs as part of a program to offer below market interest rate financing to our homebuyers in certain markets at september 30 2019  we had mbs totaling 1114 million that did not yet have irlcs or closed loans created or assigned and recorded a liability of 05 million for the fair value of such mbs position 

the following table sets forth principal cash flows by scheduled maturity effective weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value of our debt obligations as of september 30 2019  because the mortgage repurchase facility is effectively secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale that are typically sold within 60 days its outstanding balance is included in the most current period presented the interest rate for our variable rate debt represents the weighted average interest rate in effect at september 30 2019

operating structure and processes 

following is an overview of our company’s operating structure and the significant processes that support our business controls strategies and performance 

homebuilding markets 

our homebuilding business operates in 27 states and 81  markets which provides us with geographic diversification in our homebuilding inventory investments and our sources of revenues and earnings we believe our geographic diversification lowers our operational risks by mitigating the effects of local and regional economic cycles and it also enhances our earnings potential by providing more diverse opportunities to invest in our business 

we conduct our homebuilding operations in the geographic regions states and markets listed below and we conduct our financial services operations in many of these markets our homebuilding operating divisions are aggregated into six  reporting segments also referred to as reporting regions which comprise the markets below our financial statements and the notes thereto contain additional information regarding segment performance 



when evaluating new or existing homebuilding markets for purposes of capital allocation we consider local marketspecific factors including among others 

 

economies of scale 

we are the largest homebuilding company in the united states in fiscal 2018  as measured by number of homes closed and we are also one of the largest builders in many of the markets in which we operate we believe that our national regional and local scale of operations provides us with benefits that may not be available to the same degree to some other smaller homebuilders such as 

 

decentralized homebuilding operations 

we view homebuilding as a local business therefore most of our direct homebuilding activities are decentralized to provide flexibility to our local managers on operational decisions we believe that our local management teams who are familiar with local conditions have the best information to make many decisions regarding their operations at september 30 2018  we had 46  separate homebuilding operating divisions many of which operate in more than one market area generally each operating division consists of a division president a controller land entitlement acquisition and development personnel a sales manager and sales and marketing personnel a construction manager and construction superintendents customer service personnel a purchasing manager and office staff our division presidents receive performancebased compensation if they achieve targeted financial and operating metrics related to their operating divisions following is a summary of our homebuilding activities that are decentralized in our local operating divisions and the control and oversight functions that are centralized in our regional and corporate offices 

operating division responsibilities 

each operating division is responsible for 

 — a feasibility study 

— soil and environmental reviews 

— review of existing zoning and other governmental requirements 

— review of the need for and extent of offsite work required to obtain project entitlements and 

— financial analysis of the potential project 

 

centralized controls 

we centralize many important risk elements of our homebuilding business through our regional and corporate offices we have five separate homebuilding regional offices generally each regional office consists of a region president a chief financial officer legal counsel and other operational and office support staff each of our region presidents and their management teams are responsible for oversight of the operations of a number of homebuilding operating divisions including 

 

our corporate executives and corporate office departments are responsible for establishing our operational policies and internal control standards and for monitoring compliance with established policies and controls throughout our operations the corporate office also has primary responsibility for direct management of certain key risk elements and initiatives through the following centralized functions 

 

landlot acquisition and inventory management 

we acquire land for use in our homebuilding and forestar operations after we have completed due diligence and generally after we have obtained the rights known as entitlements to begin development or construction work resulting in an acceptable number of residential lots before we acquire lots or tracts of land we complete a feasibility study which includes soil tests independent environmental studies other engineering work and financial analysis we also evaluate the status of necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements required to develop and use the property for home construction although we purchase and develop land primarily to support our homebuilding activities we may sell land and lots to other developers and homebuilders where we have excess land and lot positions or for other strategic reasons 

we also enter into landlot option contracts in which we obtain the right but generally not the obligation to buy land or lots at predetermined prices on a defined schedule commensurate with anticipated home closings or planned development our option contracts generally are nonrecourse which limits our financial exposure to our earnest money deposited into escrow under the terms of the contract and any preacquisition due diligence costs we incur this enables us to control land and lot positions with limited capital investment which substantially reduces the risks associated with land ownership and development 

we directly acquire almost all of our land and lot positions we are a party to a small number of joint ventures joint ventures are consolidated if we have a controlling interest or accounted for under the equity method of accounting if we have a significant influence but not control 

we attempt to mitigate our exposure to real estate inventory risks by 

 

land development and home construction 

substantially all of our land development and home construction work is performed by subcontractors subcontractors typically are selected after a competitive bidding process and are retained for a specific subdivision or series of house plans pursuant to a contract that obligates the subcontractor to complete the scope of work at an agreedupon price we employ land development managers and construction superintendents to monitor land development and home construction activities participate in major design and building decisions coordinate the activities of subcontractors and suppliers review the work of subcontractors for quality and cost controls and monitor compliance with zoning and building codes in addition our construction superintendents interact with our homebuyers during the construction process and instruct buyers on postclosing home maintenance 

our home designs are selected or prepared in each of our markets to appeal to the preferences of local homebuyers in each community our local management teams regularly adjust our product offerings to address our customers’ expectations for affordability home size and features in many communities we offer optional interior and exterior features to homebuyers for an additional charge construction time for our homes depends on the availability of labor materials and supplies the weather the size of the home and other factors we complete the construction of most homes within two  to six months  

we typically do not maintain significant inventories of land development or construction materials except for work in progress materials for active development projects and homes under construction generally the construction materials used in our operations are readily available from numerous sources we have contracts exceeding one year with certain suppliers of building materials that are cancelable at our option 

we are subject to governmental regulations that affect our land development and construction operations at times we have experienced delays in receiving the proper approvals from municipalities or other government agencies that have delayed our anticipated development and construction activities in certain communities 

cost controls 

we control construction costs by designing our homes efficiently and by obtaining competitive bids for construction materials and labor we also competitively bid and negotiate pricing from our subcontractors and suppliers based on the volume of services and products we purchase on a local regional and national basis we monitor our land development expenditures and construction costs versus budgets for each house and community and we review our inventory levels margins expenses profitability and returns for each operating market compared to both its business plan and our performance expectations 

we control overhead costs by centralizing certain accounting and administrative functions and by monitoring staffing and compensation levels we review other general and administrative costs to identify efficiencies and savings opportunities in our operating divisions and our regional and corporate offices we also direct many of our promotional activities toward local real estate brokers and digital marketing initiatives which we believe are efficient uses of our marketing expenditures 

marketing and sales 

we use the dr horton emerald homes express homes and freedom homes brand names to market and sell our homes our dr horton branded communities are the core of our business and account for the majority of our home closings focusing primarily on the first time and first time moveup homebuyer our emerald branded communities appeal to buyers in search of higherend moveup and luxury homes our express branded communities primarily accommodate a segment of entrylevel buyers who are focused on affordability we introduced our freedom homes brand in 2016 to offer homes at affordable price points to active adult buyers seeking a lowmaintenance lifestyle the percentage of home closings and home sales revenue contributed by each brand during fiscal 2018  was as follows 



we also use the pacific ridge homes brand in our seattle market following our acquisition of their homebuilding operations in fiscal 2015 and their product offerings are similar to and included with our dr horton branded communities shown above 

we market and sell our homes primarily through commissioned employees and the majority of our home closings also involve an independent real estate broker we typically conduct home sales from sales offices located in furnished model homes in each subdivision and we generally do not offer our model homes for sale until the completion of a subdivision our sales personnel assist prospective homebuyers by providing floor plans and price information demonstrating the features and layouts of our homes and assisting with the selection of options when available we train and inform our sales personnel as to the availability of financing construction schedules and marketing and advertising plans as market conditions warrant we may provide potential homebuyers with incentives such as discounts or free upgrades to be competitive in a particular market or to attain our targeted sales pace 

we market our homes and communities to prospective homebuyers and real estate brokers digitally through email search engine marketing social media and our company website and other real estate websites in addition to print media and advertisement we also use billboards radio television magazine and newspaper advertising locally as necessary we attempt to position our subdivisions in locations that are desirable to potential homebuyers and convenient to or visible from local traffic patterns which helps to reduce advertising costs model homes play an important role in our marketing efforts and we expend significant effort and resources to create an attractive atmosphere in our model homes 

we also build speculative homes in most of our communities which allow us to compete effectively with existing homes available in the market and improve our profits and returns these homes enhance our marketing and sales efforts to prospective homebuyers who are renters or who are relocating to these markets and require a home within a short time frame as well as to independent brokers who represent these homebuyers we determine our speculative homes strategy in each market based on local market factors such as new job growth the number of job relocations housing demand and supply seasonality current sales contract cancellation trends and our past experience in the market we maintain a level of speculative home inventory in each community based on our current and planned sales pace and we monitor and adjust speculative home inventory on an ongoing basis as conditions warrant 

sales contracts and backlog 

our sales contracts require an earnest money deposit which varies in amount across our markets and communities additionally customers are generally required to pay additional deposits when they select options or upgrade features for their homes our sales contracts include a financing contingency which permits customers to cancel and receive a refund of their deposit if they cannot obtain mortgage financing at prevailing or specified interest rates within a specified period our contracts may include other contingencies such as the sale of an existing home we either retain or refund customer deposits on cancelled sales contracts depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances 

sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period at september 30 2018  the value of our backlog of sales orders was 40 billion   13371  homes an increase  of 8  from 37 billion   12329  homes at september 30 2017  the average sales price of homes in backlog was 301300  at september 30 2018  down  slightly from the 302200  average at september 30 2017  many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies such as those described above which can result in cancellations as a percentage of gross sales orders cancellations of sales contracts were 22  in both fiscal 2018  and 2017  

the length of time between the signing of a sales contract for a home and delivery of the home to the buyer closing is generally from two  to six months  therefore substantially all of the homes in our sales backlog at september 30 2018  are scheduled to close in fiscal year 2019  

customer service and quality control 

our operating divisions are responsible for preclosing quality control inspections and responding to customers’ postclosing needs we believe that a prompt and courteous response to homebuyers’ needs during and after construction reduces postclosing repair costs enhances our reputation for quality and service and ultimately leads to repeat and referral business from the real estate community and homebuyers we typically provide our homebuyers with a tenyear limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems a twoyear limited warranty on major mechanical systems and a oneyear limited warranty on other construction components the subcontractors who perform the actual construction also provide us with warranties on workmanship and are generally prepared to respond to us and the homeowner promptly upon request in addition some of our suppliers provide manufacturer’s warranties on specified products installed in the home 

forestar residential lot development operations 

during fiscal 2018  we acquired 75  of the outstanding shares of forestar forestar is a residential lot development company with operations in 24  markets and 14  states as of september 30 2018  the acquisition is a component of our homebuilding strategy to expand relationships with land developers and increase the optioned portion of our land and lot position to enhance operational efficiency and returns both our homebuilding divisions and forestar are identifying land development opportunities to expand forestar’s platform and our homebuilding operations are acquiring finished lots from forestar in accordance with the master supply agreement between the two companies as the controlling shareholder of forestar we strongly influence the strategic direction and operations of forestar 

customer mortgage financing 

we provide mortgage financing services principally to purchasers of our homes in the majority of our homebuilding markets through dhi mortgage our 100 owned subsidiary dhi mortgage assists in the sales transaction by coordinating the mortgage application mortgage commitment and home closing processes to facilitate a timely and efficient home buying experience for our buyers during the year ended september 30 2018  dhi mortgage provided mortgage financing services for approximately 56  of our total homes closed and approximately 97  of dhi mortgage’s loan volume related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations most of our homebuilding divisions also work with a number of additional mortgage lenders that offer a range of mortgage financing programs to our homebuyers 

to limit the risks associated with our mortgage operations dhi mortgage originates loan products that we believe can be sold to thirdparty purchasers of mortgage loans the majority of which are eligible for sale to the federal national mortgage association fannie mae the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac or the government national mortgage association ginnie mae dhi mortgage sells substantially all of the loans and their servicing rights to thirdparty purchasers shortly after origination with limited recourse provisions dhi mortgage centralizes most of its control and oversight functions including those related to loan underwriting quality control regulatory compliance secondary marketing of loans hedging activities accounting and financial reporting 

title services 

through our subsidiary title companies we serve as a title insurance agent in selected markets by providing title insurance policies examination and closing services primarily to our homebuilding customers we currently assume little or no underwriting risk associated with these title policies 

multifamily rental properties 

through dhi communities a 100 owned subsidiary we are developing and constructing multifamily rental properties on land parcels we already owned we currently have four  projects under active construction and two  projects that are substantially complete 

employees 

at september 30 2018  we employed 8437 persons of whom 1781  were sales and marketing personnel 2409  were involved in construction 2328  were office personnel and 1919  worked in mortgage and title operations we focus significant attention toward attracting and retaining talented and experienced individuals to manage and support our operations and we believe that we have good relations with our employees 

business acquisitions 

we routinely evaluate opportunities to profitably expand our operations including potential acquisitions of other homebuilding or related businesses acquisitions of homebuilding and related businesses usually provide us with immediate land and home inventories and control of additional land and lot positions through option contracts also employees of acquired businesses generally have specialized knowledge of local market conditions including existing relationships with municipalities land owners developers subcontractors and suppliers these inventory positions and local market knowledge and relationships could take us several years to develop through our own efforts we seek to limit the risks associated with acquiring other companies by conducting extensive operational financial and legal due diligence on each acquisition and by performing financial analysis to determine that each acquisition will have a positive impact on our earnings within an acceptable period of time 

on october 5 2017  we acquired 75  of the outstanding shares of forestar for 5583 million  in cash pursuant to the terms of the june 2017 merger agreement approved by a vote of forestar’s shareholders forestar is a publicly traded residential lot development company with operations in 24  markets and 14  states as of september 30 2018  the transaction costs incurred by us related to this acquisition totaled 72 million  of which 53 million  was incurred during fiscal 2018  and expensed to selling general and administrative expense 

in september 2016  we acquired the homebuilding operations of wilson parker homes which operated in atlanta and augusta georgia raleigh north carolina columbia south carolina and phoenix arizona 

competition 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous other national regional and local homebuilders for homebuyers desirable land raw materials skilled labor employees management talent and financing we also compete with resales of existing and foreclosed homes and with the rental housing market our homes compete on the basis of quality price location design and mortgage financing terms 

the competitors to our financial services businesses include other mortgage lenders and title companies including national regional and local mortgage bankers and other financial institutions some of these competitors are subject to fewer governmental regulations and may have greater access to capital and some of them may operate with different lending criteria and may offer a broader array of financing and other products and services to consumers than we do we strive to provide flexible fairly priced financing alternatives subject to applicable regulations 

governmental regulations and environmental matters 

the homebuilding industry is subject to extensive and complex regulations we and the subcontractors we use must comply with many federal state and local laws and regulations these include zoning density and development requirements and building environmental advertising labor and real estate sales rules and regulations these regulations and requirements affect substantially all aspects of our land development and home design construction and sales processes in varying degrees across our markets our homes are inspected by local authorities where required and homes eligible for insurance or guarantees provided by the federal housing administration fha and the department of veteran affairs va are subject to inspection by them these regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities in addition our new housing developments may be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets utilities and other public improvements 

our homebuilding and land development operations are also subject to an extensive array of local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning protection of health safety and the environment the particular compliance requirements for each site vary greatly according to location environmental condition and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties 

our mortgage company must comply with extensive state and federal laws and regulations which are administered by numerous agencies including but not limited to the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb federal housing finance agency us department of housing and urban development fha va united states department of agriculture usda fannie mae freddie mac and ginnie mae these laws and regulations include many compliance requirements including but not limited to licensing consumer disclosures fair lending and real estate settlement procedures as a result our operations are subject to regular extensive examinations by the applicable agencies 

seasonality 

although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again in the future we generally close more homes and generate greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year the seasonal nature of our business can also cause significant variations in our working capital requirements in both our homebuilding and financial services operations as a result of seasonal activity our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend 

discussion of our business and operations included in this annual report on form 10k should be read together with the risk factors set forth below they describe various risks and uncertainties we are or may become subject to many of which are difficult to predict or beyond our control these risks and uncertainties together with other factors described elsewhere in this report have the potential to affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner 

the homebuilding industry is cyclical and affected by changes in economic real estate or other conditions that could adversely affect our business or financial results 

the homebuilding industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic and real estate conditions such as 

 

adverse changes in these general and local economic conditions or deterioration in the broader economy would cause a negative impact on our business and financial results and increase the risk for asset impairments and writeoffs changes in these economic conditions may affect some of our regions or markets more than others if adverse conditions affect our larger markets they could have a proportionately greater impact on us than on some other homebuilding companies 

in the past the federal government’s fiscal policies and economic stimulus actions have created uncertainty in the financial markets and caused volatility in interest rates which impacted business and consumer behavior recently the federal reserve has increased shortterm interest rates and has indicated that future interest rate increases are likely which has caused longterm interest rates on home mortgage loans to rise monetary policy actions affecting interest rates or fiscal policy actions and new legislation related to taxation spending levels or borrowing limits along with the related political debates conflicts and compromises associated with such actions may negatively impact the financial markets and consumer confidence such events could hurt the us economy and the housing market and in turn could adversely affect the operating results of our businesses 

weather conditions and natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes volcanic activity droughts and floods heavy or prolonged precipitation or wildfires can harm our homebuilding business these can delay our development work home construction and home closings adversely affect the cost or availability of materials or labor or damage homes under construction the climates and geology of many of the states in which we operate including california florida texas and other coastal areas where we have some of our larger operations and which have experienced recent natural disasters present increased risks of adverse weather or natural disasters 

deployments of us military personnel to foreign regions terrorist attacks other acts of violence or threats to national security and any corresponding response by the united states or others related domestic or international instability or civil unrest may cause an economic slowdown in the markets where we operate which could adversely affect our homebuilding business 

public health issues such as a major epidemic or pandemic could adversely affect our business the us and other countries have experienced and may experience in the future outbreaks of contagious diseases that affect public perception of health risk in the event of a widespread prolonged actual or perceived outbreak of a contagious disease our operations could be negatively impacted by a reduction in customer traffic or other factors which could reduce demand for new homes 

if we experience any of the foregoing potential customers may be less willing or able to buy our homes in the future our pricing and product strategies may also be limited by market conditions we may be unable to change the mix of our home offerings reduce the costs of the homes we build offer more affordable homes or satisfactorily address changing market conditions in other ways without adversely affecting our profits and returns in addition cancellations of home sales contracts in backlog may increase if homebuyers do not honor their contracts due to any of the factors discussed above 

our financial services business is closely related to our homebuilding business as it originates mortgage loans principally to purchasers of the homes we build a decrease in the demand for our homes because of the foregoing matters will also adversely affect the financial results of this segment of our business an increase in the default rate on the mortgages we originate may adversely affect our ability to sell the mortgages or the pricing we receive upon the sale of mortgages or may increase our recourse obligations for previous originations we may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to thirdparty purchasers in the event of errors or omissions relating to certain representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the type of collateral the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in the connection with the loan we establish reserves related to mortgages we have sold however actual future obligations related to these mortgages could differ significantly from our current estimated amounts 

constriction of the credit and public capital markets could limit our ability to access capital and increase our costs of capital 

during past economic and housing downturns the credit markets constricted and reduced some sources of liquidity that were previously available to us consequently we relied principally on our cash on hand to meet our working capital needs and repay outstanding indebtedness during those times there likely will be periods in the future when financial market upheaval will increase our cost of capital or limit our ability to access the public debt markets or obtain bank financing 

our homebuilding operations utilize a 1325 billion  senior unsecured revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to 19 billion  subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments the facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit equal to approximately 50  of the revolving credit commitment the maturity date of the facility is september 25 2023  forestar and its subsidiaries are not guarantors under the facility or our senior notes 

forestar has a 380 million  senior unsecured revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to 570 million  subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments the facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit equal to the greater of 100 million  and 50  of the revolving credit commitment the maturity date of the facility is august 16 2021  the facility is guaranteed by forestar’s whollyowned subsidiaries that are not immaterial subsidiaries or have not been designated as unrestricted subsidiaries the facility is not guaranteed by us or our other subsidiaries 

our mortgage subsidiary utilizes a 600 million  mortgage repurchase facility to finance the majority of the loans it originates the capacity of the facility increases without requiring additional commitments to 725 million  for approximately 30 days at each quarter end and to 800 million  for approximately 45 days at fiscal year end the capacity can also be increased to 10 billion  subject to the availability of additional commitments the mortgage repurchase facility must be renewed annually and currently expires on february 22 2019  we expect to renew and extend the term of the mortgage repurchase facility with similar terms prior to its maturity adverse changes in market conditions could make the renewal of these facilities more difficult or could result in an increase in the cost of these facilities or a decrease in the committed amounts such changes affecting our mortgage repurchase facility may also make it more difficult or costly to sell the mortgages that we originate 

we regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund growth in our business repay debt obligations and support other general corporate and operational needs and we regularly evaluate our opportunities to raise additional capital we have an automatically effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec in august 2018  registering debt and equity securities that we may issue from time to time in amounts to be determined also forestar has an effective shelf registration statement filed with the sec in september 2018  registering 500 million  of equity securities as market conditions permit we may issue new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets or obtain additional bank financing to fund our projected capital requirements or provide additional liquidity we believe that our existing cash resources our revolving credit facilities our mortgage repurchase facility and our ability to access the capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our nearterm working capital needs and debt obligations including the maturity of 500 million  principal amount of senior notes in fiscal 2019  adverse changes in economic homebuilding or capital market conditions could negatively affect our business liquidity and financial results restrict our ability to obtain additional capital or increase our costs of capital 

reductions in the availability of mortgage financing provided by government agencies changes in government financing programs a decrease in our ability to sell mortgage loans on attractive terms or an increase in mortgage interest rates could decrease our buyers’ ability to obtain financing and adversely affect our business or financial results 

the mortgage loans originated by our financial services operations are primarily eligible for sale to fannie mae freddie mac and ginnie mae and are sold to thirdparty purchasers the secondary market for mortgage loans continues to primarily desire securities backed by fannie mae freddie mac or ginnie mae and we believe the liquidity these agencies provide to the mortgage industry is important to the housing market any significant change regarding the longterm structure and viability of fannie mae and freddie mac could result in adjustments to the size of their loan portfolios and to guidelines for their loan products additionally a reduction in the availability of financing provided by these institutions could adversely affect interest rates mortgage availability and sales of new homes and mortgage loans during fiscal 2018  approximately 92  of the mortgage loans sold by dhi mortgage were sold to four  major financial entities the largest percentage of which purchased 36  of the total loans sold on an ongoing basis we seek to establish loan purchase arrangements with additional financial entities if we are unable to sell mortgage loans to purchasers on attractive terms our ability to originate and sell mortgage loans at competitive prices could be limited which would negatively affect our profitability 

the fha insures mortgage loans that generally have lower credit requirements and is an important source for financing the sale of our homes changes restrictions or significant premium increases in fha programs in the future may negatively affect the availability or affordability of fha financing which could adversely affect our ability to sell homes 

some of our customers may qualify for 100 financing through programs offered by the va usda and certain other housing finance agencies these programs are subject to changes in regulations lending standards and government funding levels there can be no assurances that these programs or other programs will continue to be available in our homebuilding markets or that they will be as attractive to our customers as the programs currently offered which could negatively affect our sales 

mortgage rates are currently low as compared to most historical periods however mortgage rates have increased recently and may increase further as the federal reserve board has raised its benchmark rate several times over the past year and has indicated further interest rate increases are likely when interest rates increase the cost of owning a home increases which will likely reduce the number of potential homebuyers who can obtain mortgage financing and could result in a decline in the demand for our homes 

the risks associated with our land and lot inventory could adversely affect our business or financial results 

inventory risks are substantial for our homebuilding and forestar businesses there are risks inherent in controlling owning and developing land if housing demand declines we may not be able to build and sell homes profitably in some of our communities and we may not be able to fully recover the costs of some of the land and lots we own also the values of our owned undeveloped land lots and housing inventories may fluctuate significantly due to changes in market conditions as a result our deposits for lots controlled under option or similar contracts may be put at risk we may have to sell homes or land for a lower profit margin or record inventory impairment charges on our land and lots a significant deterioration in economic or homebuilding industry conditions may result in substantial inventory impairment charges 

we cannot make any assurances that our growth strategies acquisitions or investments will be successful or will not expose us to additional risks or other negative consequences 

in recent years we have primarily grown our business by increasing our investments in land lot and home inventories in our existing homebuilding markets we have also expanded through investments in new product offerings and in new geographic markets investments in land lots and home inventories can expose us to risks of economic loss and inventory impairments if housing conditions weaken or if we are unsuccessful in implementing our growth strategies 

on october 5 2017  we acquired 75  of the outstanding shares of forestar for 5583 million  pursuant to the terms of a merger agreement entered into in june 2017 and approved by a vote of forestar’s shareholders forestar is a publicly traded residential lot development company with operations in 24  markets and 14  states as of september 30 2018  our alignment with forestar advances our strategy of increasing our access to optioned land and lot positions to enhance operational efficiency and returns both our homebuilding divisions and forestar are identifying land development opportunities to expand forestar’s platform and our homebuilding operations are acquiring finished lots from forestar in accordance with the master supply agreement between the two companies as the controlling shareholder of forestar we strongly influence the strategic direction and operations of forestar 

in addition to the investment and merger with forestar we have acquired the homebuilding operations of several homebuilding companies in recent years and we may make strategic acquisitions of or investments in other companies operations or assets in the future such acquisitions and investments may have risks similar to those related to land lots and home inventories but they may also expose us to additional risks or other negative consequences these transactions may not advance our business strategy provide a satisfactory return on our investment or provide other benefits we anticipate also the integration of these transactions may not be successful and may require significant time and resources which may divert management’s attention from other operations acquisitions and investments could also expose us to material liabilities not discovered in the due diligence process and may lead to litigation if these transactions underperform our expectations or are unsuccessful we may incur significant expenses or writeoffs of inventory other assets or intangible assets such as goodwill acquisitions and investments can result in dilution to existing stockholders if we issue our common stock as consideration and can increase our debt levels or reduce our liquidity if we purchase them with cash the magnitude timing and nature of any future acquisitions or investments will depend on a number of factors including our ability to identify suitable additional markets or acquisition candidates the negotiation of acceptable terms our financial position and general economic and business conditions we also may seek to divest an investment or a business and may have difficulty selling such investment or business on acceptable terms in a timely manner 

our business and financial results could be adversely affected by significant inflation higher interest rates or deflation 

inflation can adversely affect us by increasing costs of land materials and labor in addition significant inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates which have a negative impact on housing affordability in a highly inflationary environment depending on industry and other economic conditions we may be precluded from raising home prices enough to keep up with the rate of inflation which could reduce our profit margins moreover in a highly inflationary environment our cost of capital labor and materials can increase and the purchasing power of our cash resources can decline which could have an adverse impact on our business or financial results 

alternatively a significant period of deflation could cause a decrease in overall spending and borrowing levels this could lead to deterioration in economic conditions including an increase in the rate of unemployment deflation could also cause the value of our inventories to decline or reduce the value of existing homes below the related mortgage loan balance which could potentially increase the supply of existing homes if oil prices decline significantly economic conditions in markets that have significant exposure to the energy sector may weaken these or other factors that increase the risk of significant deflation could have a negative impact on our business or financial results 

homebuilding is subject to home warranty and construction defect claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant 

we are subject to home warranty and construction defect claims arising in the ordinary course of our homebuilding business we rely on subcontractors to perform the actual construction of our homes and in many cases to select and obtain construction materials despite our detailed specifications and monitoring of the construction process our subcontractors occasionally do not meet adequate quality standards in the construction of our homes when we find these issues we repair them in accordance with our warranty obligations we spend significant resources to repair items in homes we have sold to fulfill the warranties we issued to our homebuyers additionally we are subject to construction defect claims which can be costly to defend and resolve in the legal system warranty and construction defect matters can also result in negative publicity in the media and on the internet which can damage our reputation and adversely affect our ability to sell homes 

based on the large number of homes we have sold over the years our potential liabilities related to warranty and construction defect claims are significant as a consequence we maintain product liability insurance and we seek to obtain indemnities and certificates of insurance from subcontractors covering claims related to their workmanship and materials we establish warranty and other reserves for the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built because of the uncertainties inherent to these matters we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will be adequate to address all of our future warranty and construction defect claims contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce we may be responsible for applicable selfinsured retentions and some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits additionally the coverage offered by and the availability of product liability insurance for construction defects is limited and costly we have responded to increases in insurance costs and coverage limitations by increasing our selfinsured retentions and claim reserves there can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted or become more costly if costs to resolve our future warranty and construction defect claims exceed our estimates our financial results and liquidity could be adversely affected 

a health and safety incident relating to our operations could be costly in terms of potential liability and reputational damage 

  

building sites are inherently dangerous and operating in the homebuilding industry poses certain inherent health and safety risks due to health and safety regulatory requirements and the number of homes we construct health and safety performance is critical to the success of our business any failure in health and safety performance may result in penalties for noncompliance with relevant regulatory requirements and a failure that results in a major or significant health and safety incident is likely to be costly and could expose us to liability that could be costly such an incident could generate significant negative publicity and have a corresponding impact on our reputation our relationships with relevant regulatory agencies or governmental authorities and our ability to attract customers and employees which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and liquidity 

damage to our corporate reputation or brands from negative publicity could adversely affect our business financial results andor stock price 

adverse publicity related to our company industry personnel operations or business performance may cause damage to our corporate reputation or brands and may generate negative sentiment potentially affecting the performance of our business or our stock price regardless of its accuracy or inaccuracy negative publicity can be disseminated rapidly through digital platforms including social media websites blogs and newsletters customers and other interested parties value readily available information and often act on such information without further investigation and without regard to its accuracy the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction and our success in preserving our brand image depends on our ability to recognize respond to and effectively manage negative publicity in a rapidly changing environment adverse publicity or unfavorable commentary from any source could damage our reputation reduce the demand for our homes or negatively impact the morale and performance of our employees which could adversely affect our business 

supply shortages and other risks related to acquiring land building materials and skilled labor could increase our costs and delay deliveries 

the homebuilding industry has from time to time experienced significant difficulties that can affect the cost or timing of construction including 

 

these factors may cause construction delays or cause us to incur more costs building our homes if the level of new home demand increases significantly in future periods the risk of shortages in residential lots labor and materials available to the homebuilding industry will likely increase 

we are required to obtain performance bonds the unavailability of which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

we often are required to provide surety bonds to secure our performance or obligations under construction contracts development agreements and other arrangements at september 30 2018  we had 15 billion  of outstanding surety bonds our ability to obtain surety bonds primarily depends upon our credit rating financial condition past performance and other factors including the capacity of the surety market and the underwriting practices of surety bond issuers the ability to obtain surety bonds also can be impacted by the willingness of insurance companies to issue performance bonds for construction and development activities if we are unable to obtain surety bonds when required our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

increases in the costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business or financial results 

prior to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act tax act which was enacted into law on december 22 2017 significant expenses of owning a home including mortgage loan interest and state and local taxes generally were deductible expenses for an individual’s federal income taxes subject to various limitations the tax act establishes new limits on the federal tax deductions individual taxpayers may take on mortgage loan interest payments and on state and local taxes including property taxes these changes could reduce the actual or perceived affordability of homeownership which could adversely affect demand for and sales prices of new homes especially in areas with relatively high housing prices or high state and local income taxes and real estate taxes any further change in income tax laws by the federal or state government to eliminate or substantially reduce income tax benefits associated with homeownership could adversely affect demand for and sales prices of new homes 

in addition increases in property tax rates by local governmental authorities as experienced in some areas in response to reduced federal and state funding could adversely affect the amount of financing our potential customers could obtain or their desire to purchase new homes 

governmental regulations and environmental matters could increase the cost and limit the availability of our land development and homebuilding projects and adversely affect our business or financial results 

we are subject to extensive and complex regulations that affect land development and home construction including zoning density restrictions building design and building standards these regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities as to the conditions we must meet prior to development or construction being approved if approved at all we are subject to determinations by these authorities as to the adequacy of water or sewage facilities roads or other local services new housing developments may also be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets and other public improvements in addition in many markets government authorities have implemented no growth or growth control initiatives any of these may limit delay or increase the costs of development or home construction 

we are also subject to a significant number and variety of local state and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of health safety labor standards and the environment the impact of environmental laws varies depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available these matters may result in delays may cause us to incur substantial compliance remediation mitigation and other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas government agencies also routinely initiate audits reviews or investigations of our business practices to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations which can cause us to incur costs or create other disruptions in our business that can be significant for example we have received notices of violation from the united states environmental protection agency related to stormwater compliance at certain of our sites in our southeast region this matter could potentially result in requirements for us to perform additional compliance procedures and to pay monetary sanctions 

the subcontractors we rely on to perform the actual construction of our homes are also subject to a significant number of local state and federal laws and regulations including laws involving matters that are not within our control if the subcontractors who construct our homes fail to comply with all applicable laws we can suffer reputational damage and may be exposed to possible liability 

we are also subject to an extensive number of laws and regulations because our common stock and debt securities and those of our forestar subsidiary are publicly traded in the capital markets these regulations govern our communications with our shareholders and the capital markets our financial statement disclosures and our legal processes and they also impact the work required to be performed by our independent registered public accounting firm and our legal counsel changes in these laws and regulations including the subsequent implementation of rules by the administering government authorities may require us to incur additional compliance costs and such costs may be significant 

governmental regulation of our financial services operations could adversely affect our business or financial results 

our financial services operations are subject to extensive state and federal laws and regulations which are administered by numerous agencies including but not limited to the cfpb federal housing finance agency us department of housing and urban development fha va usda fannie mae freddie mac and ginnie mae these laws and regulations include many compliance requirements including but not limited to licensing consumer disclosures fair lending and real estate settlement procedures as a result our operations are subject to regular extensive examinations by the applicable agencies 

in fiscal 2013 our mortgage subsidiary was subpoenaed by the united states department of justice doj regarding the adequacy of certain underwriting and quality control processes related to fha loans originated and sold in prior years we have provided information related to these loans and our processes to the   doj and communications are ongoing the doj has to date not asserted any formal claim amount penalty or fine 

due to the significant increases in regulations in recent years operating costs have increased for our mortgage operations the possibility of additional future regulations changing rule interpretations and examinations by regulatory agencies may result in more stringent compliance standards and could adversely affect the results of our operations 

we have significant amounts of consolidated debt and may incur additional debt our debt obligations and our ability to comply with related covenants restrictions or limitations could adversely affect our financial condition 

as of september 30 2018  our consolidated debt was 32 billion  and we had 11 billion  principal amount of our debt maturing before the end of fiscal 2019  including 500 million  principal amount of senior notes and 6377 million  outstanding under the mortgage repurchase facility the indenture governing our senior notes does not restrict the incurrence of future unsecured debt by us or our homebuilding subsidiaries or the incurrence of secured or unsecured debt by our financial services subsidiaries and the agreement governing our homebuilding revolving credit facility allows us to incur a substantial amount of future unsecured debt also the indenture governing our senior notes and the agreement governing our homebuilding revolving credit facility impose restrictions on our ability and on that of the guarantors under our senior notes and our homebuilding revolving credit facility to incur debt secured by certain assets but still permit us and our homebuilding subsidiaries to incur significant amounts of additional secured debt forestar’s revolving credit facility does not restrict the incurrence of future unsecured debt by forestar or its subsidiaries or the incurrence of secured debt by forestar’s subsidiaries that are not guarantors of forestar’s revolving credit facility 

possible consequences the amount and the maturities of our debt could have important consequences for example they could 

 

in addition our debt obligations and the restrictions imposed by the instruments governing those obligations expose us to additional risks including 

dependence on future performance our ability to meet our debt service and other obligations and the financial covenants under our revolving credit and mortgage repurchase facilities will depend in part upon our future financial performance our future results are subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report our revenues and earnings vary with the level of general economic activity in the markets we serve our businesses are also affected by financial political business and other factors many of which are beyond our control the factors that affect our ability to generate cash can also affect our ability to raise additional funds for these purposes through the sale of debt or equity the refinancing of debt or the sale of assets changes in prevailing interest rates may affect the cost of our debt service obligations because borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and mortgage repurchase facility bear interest at floating rates 

homebuilding revolving credit facility our homebuilding revolving credit facility contains financial covenants requiring the maintenance of a maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and a borrowing base restriction if our ratio of debt to tangible net worth exceeds a certain level a failure to comply with these financial covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under this revolving credit facility or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity 

forestar’s revolving credit facility forestar’s revolving credit facility contains financial covenants requiring the maintenance by forestar of a minimum level of tangible net worth a minimum level of liquidity a maximum allowable leverage ratio and a borrowing base restriction based on the book value of forestar’s real estate assets and unrestricted cash a failure to comply with these financial covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under this revolving credit facility or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity 

mortgage repurchase facility and other restrictions the mortgage repurchase facility for our mortgage subsidiary requires the maintenance of a minimum level of tangible net worth a maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and a minimum level of liquidity by our mortgage subsidiary a failure to comply with these requirements could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds to our mortgage subsidiary or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity any difficulty experienced in complying with these covenants could make the renewal of the facility more difficult or costly 

in addition although our financial services business is conducted through subsidiaries that are not restricted by the indenture governing our senior notes or the agreements governing our revolving credit facilities the ability of our financial services subsidiaries to distribute funds to our homebuilding operations would be restricted in the event such distribution would cause an event of default under the mortgage repurchase facility or if an event of default had occurred under this facility moreover our right to receive assets from these subsidiaries upon their liquidation or recapitalization is subject to the prior claims of the creditors of these subsidiaries any claims we may have to funds from our financial services subsidiaries would be subordinate to subsidiary indebtedness to the extent of any security for such indebtedness and to any indebtedness otherwise recognized as senior to our claims 

changes in debt ratings our senior unsecured debt is currently rated investment grade by all three major rating agencies however there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain this rating any lowering of our debt ratings could make accessing the public capital markets or obtaining additional credit from banks more difficult andor more expensive 

change of control purchase options and change of control default  upon the occurrence of both a change of control and a ratings downgrade event each as defined in the indenture governing our homebuilding senior notes we will be required to offer to repurchase such notes at 101  of their principal amount together with all accrued and unpaid interest if any moreover a change of control as defined in our homebuilding revolving credit facility would constitute an event of default under our homebuilding revolving credit facility which could result in the acceleration of the repayment of any borrowings outstanding under the facility a requirement to cash collateralize all letters of credit outstanding thereunder and the termination of the commitments thereunder if repayment of more than 50 million outstanding under our homebuilding revolving credit facility were accelerated and such acceleration were not rescinded or such indebtedness were not satisfied in either case within 30 days an event of default would result under the indenture governing our homebuilding senior notes entitling the trustee for the notes or holders of at least 25 percent in principal amount of the relevant series of notes then outstanding to declare all such notes to be due and payable immediately if purchase offers were required under the indenture for our homebuilding senior notes repayment of the borrowings under our homebuilding revolving credit facility were required or if the senior notes were accelerated we can give no assurance that we would have sufficient funds to pay the required amounts 

change of control default under forestar’s revolving credit facility  a change of control as defined in forestar’s revolving credit facility with respect to forestar would constitute an event of default under forestar’s revolving credit facility which could result in the acceleration of the repayment of any borrowings outstanding under the facility a requirement to cash collateralize all letters of credit outstanding thereunder and the termination of the commitments thereunder if repayment of the borrowings under forestar’s revolving credit facility were required we can give no assurance that forestar would have sufficient funds to pay the required amounts 

homebuilding and financial services are competitive industries and competitive conditions could adversely affect our business or financial results 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive homebuilders compete not only for homebuyers but also for desirable properties financing raw materials and skilled labor we compete with local regional and national homebuilders and also with existing home sales foreclosures and rental properties the competitive conditions in the homebuilding industry can negatively affect our sales volumes selling prices and incentive levels reduce our profit margins and cause the value of our inventory or other assets to be impaired competition can also affect our ability to acquire suitable land raw materials and skilled labor at acceptable prices or terms or cause delays in land development or in the construction of our homes 

the competitors to our financial services businesses include other title companies and mortgage lenders including national regional and local mortgage banks and other financial institutions some of these competitors are subject to fewer governmental regulations and have greater access to capital than we do and some of them may operate with different lending criteria than we do these competitors may offer a broader or more attractive array of financing and other products and services to potential customers than we do 

our businesses compete with other companies across all industries to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced employees managers and executives competition for the services of these individuals increases as business conditions improve in the homebuilding and financial services industries and in the general economy if we are unable to attract and retain key employees managers or executives our business could be adversely affected 

our business could be adversely affected by the loss of key personnel 

we rely on our key personnel to effectively operate and manage our businesses specifically our success depends heavily on the performance of our homebuilding division and region presidents and their management teams our forestar management team our financial services management team our corporate office management teams and our executive officers these key personnel have significant experience and skills in the homebuilding land development and financial services industries as well as leadership and management abilities that are important to our success we seek to retain our key personnel and to have succession plans in place to address the potential loss of key personnel however if our retention and succession planning efforts are unsuccessful or if we fail to attract suitable replacements the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business 

information technology failures and data security breaches could harm our business 

we use information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational and marketing activities and to maintain our business records these information technology systems are dependent upon global communications providers web browsers thirdparty software and data storage providers and other aspects of the internet infrastructure that have experienced security breaches cyberattacks significant systems failures and service outages in the past a material breach in the security of our information technology systems or other data security controls could include the theft or release of customer employee or company data a data security breach a significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems or a breach of any of our data security controls could disrupt our business operations damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers adversely impact our sales and revenue and require us to incur significant expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve these kinds of issues the release of confidential information as a result of a security breach could also lead to litigation or other proceedings against us by affected individuals or business partners or by regulators and the outcome of such proceedings which could include penalties or fines could have a significant negative impact on our business we may also be required to incur significant costs to protect against damages caused by information technology failures or security breaches in the future we provide employee awareness training of cybersecurity threats and routinely utilize information technology security experts to assist us in our evaluations of the effectiveness of the security of our information technology systems and we regularly enhance our security measures to protect our systems and data we use various encryption tokenization and authentication technologies to mitigate cybersecurity risks and have increased our monitoring capabilities to enhance early detection and rapid response to potential cyber threats however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures consequently we cannot provide assurances that a security breach cyberattack data theft or other significant systems or security failures will not occur in the future and such occurrences could have a material and adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position

in fiscal 2013 our mortgage subsidiary was subpoenaed by the united states department of justice doj regarding the adequacy of certain underwriting and quality control processes related to federal housing administration loans originated and sold in prior years we have provided information related to these loans and our processes to the   doj and communications are ongoing the doj has to date not asserted any formal claim amount penalty or fine

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend 

results of operations — fiscal year 2018  overview 

during fiscal 2018  demand for new homes across most of our markets was strong particularly at affordable price points and the supply of new homes for sale remained limited the level of strength in new home demand and home prices varied across our markets based on the relative strength of each market’s economy as measured by job growth household incomes household formations and consumer confidence and the relative affordability of new home prices as compared to household incomes in each market 

sales prices for both new and resale homes have increased across most of our markets over the past several years which has generally reduced housing affordability during fiscal 2018  interest rates on mortgage loans increased which further impacted affordability these conditions have resulted in some recent moderation of demand for new homes particularly at higher price points however we continue to see solid economic fundamentals and a limited supply of homes at affordable prices across most of our markets 

our position as the most geographically diverse and largest volume homebuilder in the united states provides a strong platform for us to compete for new home sales in recent years we have expanded our product offerings to include a broad range of homes for entrylevel moveup and luxury buyers across most of our markets our affordable entrylevel homes have experienced very strong demand from homebuyers as the entrylevel segment of the new home market remains underserved with low inventory levels relative to demand more recently we have also been introducing homes at affordable price points in communities designed for active adult buyers seeking a lowmaintenance lifestyle 

we believe our business is well positioned with a broad geographic footprint diverse product offerings a balanced supply of finished lots land and homes a strong balance sheet and liquidity and experienced personnel across our operating markets we remain focused on growing our revenues and profitability generating positive annual cash flows from operations and managing our product offerings pricing sales pace and inventory levels to optimize the return on our inventory investments 

in fiscal 2018  our number of homes closed and home sales revenues increased   13  and 14  respectively compared to the prior year our pretax income was 21 billion  in fiscal 2018  compared to 16 billion  in fiscal 2017  and 14 billion  in fiscal 2016  our pretax operating margin increased to 128  in fiscal 2018  compared to 114  in fiscal 2017  and 111  in fiscal 2016  the increase in 2018  compared to 2017  was primarily the result of an increase in our home sales gross margin during fiscal 2018  we reduced sales incentives or raised prices in communities where we were achieving our targeted sales pace while striving to ensure our product offerings remained affordable as land and construction costs have generally increased we have leveraged our scale and relationships to control these increases cash provided by our homebuilding operations was 10 billion  in fiscal 2018  compared to 3037 million  in fiscal 2017  and 5805 million  in fiscal 2016  in fiscal 2018  our homebuilding return on inventory roi improved to 202  compared to 166  in fiscal 2017  and 154  in fiscal 2016  homebuilding roi is calculated as homebuilding pretax income for the year divided by average inventory average inventory in the roi calculation is the sum of ending inventory balances for the trailing five quarters divided by five 

within our homebuilding land and lot portfolio our lots controlled under option purchase contracts represent 57  of the lots owned and controlled at september 30 2018  compared to 50  at september 30 2017  the forestar acquisition is advancing our homebuilding strategy of increasing our access to optioned land and lot positions  

we believe that housing demand in our individual operating markets is tied closely to each market’s economy therefore we expect that housing market conditions will continue to vary across our markets if the us economy remains strong we expect to see continued strength in housing demand concentrated in markets where job growth is occurring and new home prices remain affordable relative to household incomes the pace and sustainability of new home demand and our future results could be negatively affected by weakening economic conditions decreases in the level of employment and housing demand decreased home affordability further increases in mortgage interest rates or tightening of mortgage lending standards 

strategy 

our operating strategy focuses on leveraging our financial and competitive position to increase the returns on our inventory investments and generate strong profitability and cash flows while managing risk and maintaining financial flexibility to make opportunistic strategic investments this strategy includes the following initiatives 

 

we believe our operating strategy which has produced positive results in recent years will allow us to maintain and improve our financial and competitive position and balance sheet strength however we cannot provide any assurances that the initiatives listed above will continue to be successful and we may need to adjust components of our strategy to meet future market conditions 

key results 

key financial results as of and for our fiscal year ended september 30 2018  or from the acquisition date of october 5 2017  through september 30 2018  for forestar’s results as compared to fiscal 2017  were as follows

results of operations — homebuilding 

our operating segments are our 46  homebuilding divisions our majorityowned forestar lot development operations our financial services operations and our other business activities the homebuilding operating segments are aggregated into six  reporting segments these reporting segments which we also refer to as reporting regions have homebuilding operations located in the following states 



the following tables and related discussion set forth key operating and financial data for our homebuilding operations by reporting segment as of and for the fiscal years ended september 30 2018  2017  and 2016  



 





 

 

net sales orders 

2018 versus 2017 

the value of net sales orders increased   13  to 158 billion   52740  homes in 2018  from 139 billion   46605  homes in 2017  with increases in all of our regions the increases in the value of sales orders were due to increased volume the average selling price of homes sold during fiscal 2018  was 298800  essentially unchanged from the prior year 

the number of net sales orders increased   13  during 2018  compared to 2017  the increase in net sales orders reflects the strength in demand in most of our markets particularly at affordable price points our chicago and phoenix markets contributed the most to higher sales volumes in our midwest and southwest regions respectively our sales order cancellation rate cancelled sales orders divided by gross sales orders for the period was 22  in both years 

we believe our business is well positioned to continue to generate increased sales volume however our future sales volumes will depend on new home demand in each of our operating markets and our ability to successfully implement our operating strategies 

2017 versus 2016 

the value of net sales orders increased   16  to 139 billion   46605  homes in 2017  from 120 billion   40814  homes in 2016  with increases in all of our regions the increase in the value of sales orders was due to increased volume and to a lesser extent increased selling prices in some regions 

the number of net sales orders increased   14  and the average price of net sales orders increased   2  to 299100  during 2017  compared to 2016  our phoenix and carolina markets contributed the most to higher sales volumes in our southwest and east regions respectively our sales order cancellation rate was 22  in 2017  compared to 23  in 2016 



sales order backlog 

sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies including mortgage loan approval and buyers selling their existing homes which can result in cancellations a portion of the contracts in backlog will not result in closings due to cancellations our acquisition of the assets of permian homes contributed 159  homes valued at 442 million  to the sales order backlog of our south central region during fiscal 2018

revenues from home sales increased   14  to 155 billion   51857  homes closed in 2018  from 137 billion   45751  homes closed in 2017  the increase in home sales revenues reflects the strength in demand in most of our markets particularly at affordable price points 

the number of homes closed in fiscal 2018   increased   13  from 2017  due to increases in all of our regions our phoenix carolina and minneapolis markets contributed the most to higher closing volumes in our southwest east and midwest regions respectively the average selling price of homes closed during fiscal 2018  was 298900  essentially unchanged from the prior year 

2017 versus 2016 

revenues from home sales increased   16  to 137 billion   45751  homes closed in 2017  from 118 billion   40309  homes closed in 2016

homebuilding operating margin analysis 



home sales gross profit 

2018 versus 2017 

gross profit from home sales increased   21  to 33 billion  in 2018  from 27 billion in 2017  and increased   130 basis points to 213  as a percentage of home sales revenues the percentage increase  resulted from improvements of 60  basis points due to the average selling price of our homes closed increasing by more than the average cost 40  basis points from a decrease  in warranty and construction defect expenses and 30  basis points from a decrease  in the amortization of capitalized interest 

we remain focused on managing the pricing incentives and sales pace in each of our communities to optimize the returns on our inventory investments and adjust to local market conditions and new home demand these actions could cause our gross profit margins to fluctuate in future periods 

2017 versus 2016 

gross profit from home sales increased   15  to 27 billion  in 2017  from 24 billion  in 2016  and decreased   20 basis points to 200  as a percentage of home sales revenues the percentage decrease  resulted from a decrease of 50  basis points due to an increase  in warranty and construction defect expenses partially offset by an improvement of 30  basis points due to a decrease  in the amortization of capitalized interest 

land sales and other revenues 

land sales and other revenues from our homebuilding operations were 1218 million  883 million  and 787 million  in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively land sales and other revenues during fiscal 2018  included 395 million  from the sale of a parcel of land in phoenix we continually evaluate our land and lot supply and fluctuations in revenues and profitability from land sales occur based on how we manage our inventory levels in various markets we generally purchase land and lots with the intent to build and sell homes on them however some of the land that we purchase includes commercially zoned parcels that we may sell to commercial developers we may also sell residential lots or land parcels to manage our supply or for other strategic reasons as of september 30 2018  our homebuilding operations had 402 million  of land held for sale that we expect to sell in the next twelve months 

inventory and land option charges 

at the end of each quarter during fiscal 2018  we reviewed the performance and outlook for all of our communities and land inventories for indicators of potential impairment and performed detailed impairment evaluations and analyses when necessary as of september 30 2018  we performed detailed impairment evaluations of communities and land inventories with a combined carrying value of 605 million  and recorded impairment charges of 26 million  during the fourth  quarter to reduce the carrying value of impaired communities and land to fair value total homebuildingu impairment charges during fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  were 109 million  232 million  and 203 million  respectively 

as we manage our inventory investments across our operating markets to optimize returns and cash flows we may modify our pricing and incentives construction and development plans or land sale strategies in individual active communities and land held for development which could result in the affected communities being evaluated for potential impairment also if housing or economic conditions weaken in specific markets in which we operate or if conditions weaken in the broader economy or homebuilding industry we may be required to evaluate additional communities for potential impairment these evaluations could result in additional impairment charges 

during fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs related to land option contracts that we have terminated or expect to terminate were 134 million  170 million  and 111 million  respectively total homebuilding inventory and land option charges of 488 million  for fiscal 2018  also include a charge of 245 million  in the second quarter related to the settlement of an outstanding dispute associated with a land transaction 

selling general and administrative sga expense 

sga expense from homebuilding activities was 13 billion  12 billion  and 11 billion  in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively an increase  of 10  in 2018  and 11  in 2017  from the respective prior years as a percentage of homebuilding revenues sga expense decreased   30 basis points to 86  in 2018  and decreased   40  basis points to 89  in 2017  from the respective prior years 

employee compensation and related costs were 9642 million  8602 million  and 7487 million  in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively representing 72  70  and 68  of sga costs in those years these costs increased   12  in 2018  and 15  in 2017  due to increases in the number of employees and the amount of incentive compensation as compared to the respective prior years our homebuilding operations employed 6419  5876 and 5356  employees at september 30 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively 

we attempt to control our sga costs while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports our operations however we cannot make assurances that we will be able to maintain or improve upon the current sga expense as a percentage of revenues 

interest incurred 

we capitalize interest costs incurred to inventory during active development and construction active inventory capitalized interest is charged to cost of sales as the related inventory is delivered to the buyer interest incurred by our homebuilding operations decreased   9  to 1099 million  in fiscal 2018  and decreased   16  to 1208 million  in fiscal 2017  compared to the respective prior years these decreases were due to decreases in our average homebuilding debt of 4  and 12  in fiscal 2018  and 2017  respectively and lower average interest rates on our outstanding homebuilding debt during the periods interest charged to cost of sales was 11  14  and 18  of total cost of sales excluding inventory and land option charges in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively 

other income 

other income net of other expenses included in our homebuilding operations was 72 million  110 million  and 82 million  in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively other income consists of interest income rental income and various other types of ancillary income gains expenses and losses not directly associated with sales of homes land and lots the activities that result in this ancillary income or expense are not significant either individually or in the aggregate 

goodwill impairment 

we perform our annual goodwill impairment evaluation in the fourth  quarter of each fiscal year as a result of the 2018  and 2017  evaluations no  impairment charges were recorded as a result of the 2016  evaluation a 72 million  impairment charge was recorded to reduce the goodwill in the huntsville operating segment in our southeast reporting region this operating segment had experienced lower levels of profitability than anticipated primarily due to difficult market conditions 

business acquisitions 

on october 5 2017  we acquired 75  of the outstanding shares of forestar for 5583 million  in cash pursuant to the terms of the june 2017 merger agreement forestar is a publicly traded residential lot development company listed on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol “for” with operations in 24  markets and 14  states as of september 30 2018  the transaction costs incurred by us related to this acquisition totaled 72 million  of which 53 million  was incurred during fiscal 2018  and expensed to homebuilding selling general and administrative expense

financial services operating margin analysis 



 



mortgage loan activity 

the volume of loans originated by our mortgage operations is directly related to the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations in fiscal 2018  and 2017  the volume of firstlien loans originated or brokered by dhi mortgage for our homebuyers increased   14  and 16  from the respective prior years primarily as a result of increases  in the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations of 13  and 14  respectively the percentage of homes closed for which dhi mortgage handled the homebuyers’ financing was 56  in fiscal 2018  and 2017  and 55  in fiscal 2016  

homes closed by our homebuilding operations constituted 97  95  and 93  of dhi mortgage loan originations in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively these percentages reflect dhi mortgage’s consistent focus on the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations 

the number of loans sold increased   7  in fiscal 2018  and 14  in fiscal 2017  compared to the respective prior years virtually all of the mortgage loans held for sale on september 30 2018  were eligible for sale to fannie mae freddie mac or ginnie mae approximately 92  of the mortgage loans sold by dhi mortgage during fiscal 2018  were sold to four  major financial entities the largest percentage of which purchased 36  of the total loans sold 

financial services revenues and expenses 

revenues from our financial services operations increased   7  to 3753 million  in fiscal 2018  from 3495 million  in fiscal 2017  while the number of loan originations increased   11  over that same period revenues from our financial services operations increased 18  to 3495 million  in fiscal 2017  from 2956 million  in fiscal 2016  while the number of loan originations increased 13  in fiscal 2018  revenues increased at a lower rate than origination volume primarily due to lower pricing and resulting net gains on loan origination sales due to competitive pressures in the mortgage market in fiscal 2017  revenues increased at a higher rate than origination volume primarily due to improved loan sale execution in the secondary market and increased revenue from title operations 

our mortgage operations revenues were reduced by 13 million  29 million  and 85 million  in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively to increase our loss reserves for estimated future recourse obligations and other mortgage loans and to adjust certain mortgage loans held for sale to fair value our loss reserves for loan recourse obligations are estimated based upon analysis of the volume of mortgages originated loan repurchase requests received actual repurchases and losses through the disposition of such loans or requests and discussions with our mortgage purchasers actual losses on mortgage loans may differ from our estimates which may result in future changes to our loss reserves 

general and administrative ga expense related to financial services operations was 2726 million  2393 million  and 2112 million  in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively increasing   14  in 2018  and 13  in 2017  from the respective prior years these increases were primarily due to increases in employee related costs due to increased volume our financial services operations employed 1919  1798  and 1575  employees at september 30 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively 

as a percentage of financial services revenues ga expense was 726  685  and 714  in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively the increase in the current year was primarily due to lower pricing and resulting net gains on loan origination sales resulting in reduced revenue relative to origination volume fluctuations in financial services ga expense as a percentage of revenues can be expected to occur as some components of revenue may fluctuate differently than loan volumes and some expenses are not directly related to mortgage loan volume or to changes in the amount of revenue earned 

other income net of other expense included in our financial services operations consists primarily of the interest income of our mortgage subsidiary 

results of operations — consolidated 

income before income taxes 

pretax income was 21 billion  16 billion  and 14 billion  in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively the increase in our pretax income over the threeyear period is primarily due to higher revenues from increased home closings and an increase in home sales gross profit 

income taxes 

our income tax expense was 5977 million  5637 million  and 4672 million  in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively and our effective tax rate was 290  352  and 345  in those years the effective tax rate for fiscal 2018  reflects the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act tax act which was enacted into law on december 22 2017  an excess tax benefit related to stockbased compensation the release of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets related to forestar and the enactment of the bipartisan budget act of 2018 which retroactively extended the expiration date of the federal energy efficient home credit from december 31 2016 until december 31 2017 the effective tax rates for all years include an expense for state income taxes reduced by tax benefits for the domestic production activities deduction 

the tax act reduced the corporate tax rate from 35  to 21  for all corporations effective january 1 2018 for fiscal year companies the change in law requires the application of a blended tax rate in the year of change which for us was 245  for the fiscal year ended september 30 2018  thereafter the applicable statutory tax rate is 21  asc 740 requires all companies to reflect the effects of the new law in the period in which the law was enacted accordingly we reduced the statutory tax rate that applied to our yeartodate earnings from 35  to 245  in addition we remeasured our deferred tax assets and liabilities for the tax law change which resulted in additional income tax expense of 1087 million  recognized during the three months ended december 31 2017 no other tax law changes as a result of the tax act had a significant impact on our financial statements our deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities were 2117 million  at september 30 2018  compared to 3762 million  at september 30 2017  

on october 5 2017  we acquired 75  of the outstanding shares of forestar we recorded goodwill of 292 million  which is not deductible for income tax purposes at the acquisition date we recorded a valuation allowance of 201 million  against forestar’s 204 million  of deferred tax assets due to forestar’s cumulative losses in recent years during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 forestar emerged from the cumulative loss position we evaluated all positive and negative evidence and determined the emergence from the cumulative loss position and other positive evidence outweighed the negative evidence and reduced the valuation allowance which resulted in a corresponding reduction in income tax expense as of september 30 2018  we have retained a valuation allowance of 35 million  related to forestar’s state deferred tax assets for net operating loss nol carryforwards that are more likely than not to expire before being realized 

in addition to the 35 million  valuation allowance related to forestar’s state deferred tax assets we have a valuation allowance of 142 million  related to dr horton’s state deferred tax assets for net operating loss nol carryforwards because it is more likely than not that a portion of the state nol carryforwards will expire before being realized in total our valuation allowance was 177 million  at september 30 2018  and 112 million  at september 30 2017  we will continue to evaluate both the positive and negative evidence in determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to our remaining state nol carryforwards any reversal of the valuation allowance in future periods will impact our effective tax rate 

dr horton has 193 million  of tax benefits for state nol carryforwards that expire at various times depending on the tax jurisdiction of the total amount 54 million  of the tax benefits expire over the next ten years and the remaining 139 million  expires from fiscal years 2029 to 2038 

forestar has 148 million  of tax benefits for federal nol carryforwards after consideration of intraentity profit eliminations which have no expiration date additionally forestar has 40 million  of tax benefits for state nol carryforwards that expire at various times depending on the tax jurisdiction 

the accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future results could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position also changes in existing federal and state tax laws and tax rates could affect future tax results and the valuation of our deferred tax assets 

dr horton is subject to federal income tax and to income tax in multiple states the statute of limitations for dr horton’s major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for fiscal years 2015 through 2018 dr horton is currently being audited by various states however to date we are not aware of any significant findings identified by the taxing authorities 

forestar is subject to federal income tax and to income tax in multiple states all federal statutes of limitations for tax years prior to 2016 are effectively closed the statute of limitations in major state jurisdictions for tax years prior to 2014 is closed forestar is currently under audit by the irs for the 2016 tax year at this time forestar is not aware of any significant findings identified by the irs forestar is not currently being audited by any state jurisdictions 

capital resources and liquidity

financing cash flow activities 

we expect the shortterm financing needs of our operations will be funded with existing cash cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities longterm financing needs for the growth of our homebuilding and forestar operations may be funded with the issuance of senior unsecured debt securities or equity securities through the public capital markets 

in fiscal 2018  net cash used in financing activities was 825 million  consisting primarily of note repayments that were largely offset by note proceeds payments of cash dividends and repurchases of common stock note repayments of 22 billion  included the repayments of amounts drawn on our homebuilding revolving credit facility of 18 billion  and our early redemption of the 400 million  principal amount of our 3625  senior notes due february 2018 proceeds from notes payable of 22 billion  included draws of 18 billion  on our homebuilding revolving credit facility and our issuance of 400 million  principal amount of 255  senior notes due december 1 2020  our financial services segment received proceeds of 2177 million  from net advances under its mortgage repurchase facility during fiscal 2018  we used cash of 1884 million  to pay dividends to our common stockholders and 1275 million  to repurchase 28 million  shares of our common stock

contractual cash obligations commercial commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

our primary contractual cash obligations are payments under our debt agreements and lease payments under operating leases we expect to fund our contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business through a combination of our existing cash resources cash flows generated from profits our credit facilities or other bank financing and the issuance of new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets as market conditions may permit 

our future cash requirements for contractual obligations as of september 30 2018  are presented below 



 

 

at september 30 2018  we had outstanding letters of credit of 1285 million  and surety bonds of 15 billion  issued by third parties to secure performance under various contracts we expect that our performance obligations secured by these letters of credit and bonds will generally be completed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms when we complete our performance obligations the related letters of credit and bonds are generally released shortly thereafter leaving us with no continuing obligations we have no material thirdparty guarantees 

our mortgage subsidiary enters into various commitments related to the lending activities of our mortgage operations further discussion of these commitments is provided in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” under part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

seasonality 

although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again in the future we generally close more homes and generate greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year the seasonal nature of our business can also cause significant variations in our working capital requirements in both our homebuilding and financial services operations as a result of seasonal activity our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year 

inflation 

we may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation primarily because of higher financing land labor and material construction costs we attempt to offset cost increases in one component with savings in another and we increase our sales prices and reduce customer sales incentives when housing market conditions permit however during periods when housing market conditions are challenging we may not be able to offset cost increases with higher selling prices in addition higher mortgage interest rates reduce the affordability of our homes to prospective homebuyers

critical accounting policies 

general  — a comprehensive enumeration of the significant accounting policies of dr horton inc and subsidiaries is presented in note a  to the accompanying financial statements as of september 30 2018  and 2017  and for the years ended september 30 2018  2017  and 2016  each of our accounting policies has been chosen based upon current authoritative literature that collectively comprises us generally accepted accounting principles gaap in instances where alternative methods of accounting are permissible under gaap we have chosen the method that most appropriately reflects the nature of our business the results of our operations and our financial condition and have consistently applied those methods over each of the periods presented in the financial statements the audit committee of our board of directors has reviewed and approved the accounting policies selected 

revenue recognition  — we generally recognize homebuilding revenue and related profit at the time of the closing of a sale when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer in situations where the buyer’s financing is originated by dhi mortgage our 100 owned mortgage subsidiary and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment the profit is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a thirdparty purchaser has been completed any profit on land sales is deferred until the full accrual method criteria are met when appropriate revenue and profit on longterm construction projects are recognized under the percentageofcompletion method 

we include proceeds from home closings held for our benefit at title companies in homebuilding cash when we execute sales contracts with our homebuyers or when we require advance payment from homebuyers for custom changes upgrades or options related to their homes we record the cash deposits received as liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are cancelled we either retain or refund to the homebuyer deposits on cancelled sales contracts depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances 

we recognize financial services revenues associated with our title operations as closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued both of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed we transfer substantially all underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies to thirdparty insurers we typically elect the fair value option for our mortgage loan originations mortgage loans held for sale are initially recorded at fair value based on either sale commitments or current market quotes and are adjusted for subsequent changes in fair value until the loans are sold net origination costs and fees associated with mortgage loans are recognized at the time of origination the expected net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of a loan are included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings at the time of commitment we sell substantially all of the mortgages we originate and the related servicing rights to thirdparty purchasers interest income is earned from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold 

some mortgage loans are sold with limited recourse provisions which can result in repurchases of loans previously sold to investors or payments to reimburse investors for loan losses based on historical experience discussions with our mortgage purchasers analysis of the mortgages we originated and current housing and credit market conditions we estimate and record a loss reserve for mortgage loans held in portfolio and mortgage loans held for sale as well as known and projected mortgage loan repurchase requests 

inventories and cost of sales  — inventory includes the costs of direct land acquisition land development and home construction capitalized interest real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and home construction costs that we incur after development projects or homes are substantially complete such as utilities maintenance and cleaning are charged to sga expense as incurred all indirect overhead costs such as compensation of sales personnel division and region management and the costs of advertising and builder’s risk insurance are charged to sga expense as incurred 

land and development costs are typically allocated to individual residential lots on a prorata basis and the costs of residential lots are transferred to construction in progress when home construction begins home construction costs are specifically identified and recorded to individual homes cost of sales for homes closed includes the specific construction costs of each home and all applicable land acquisition land development and related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred allocated to each residential lot based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each community any changes to the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial home closings in a community are generally allocated on a prorata basis to the remaining homes in the community associated with the relevant development activity 

when a home is closed we generally have not paid all incurred costs necessary to complete the home we record a liability and a charge to cost of sales for the amount estimated to ultimately be paid related to completed homes that have been closed we compare our home construction budgets to actual recorded costs to determine the additional costs remaining to be paid on each closed home we monitor the accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on closed homes in subsequent months to the amounts previously accrued although actual costs to be paid in the future on previously closed homes could differ from our current accruals such differences have not been significant 

each quarter we review our communities and land inventories for indicators of potential impairment we generally review our inventory for impairment indicators at the community level and the inventory within each community is categorized as land held for development residential land and lots developed and under development land held for sale and construction in progress and finished homes based on the stage of production or plans for future development or sale a particular community often includes inventory in more than one category in certain situations inventory may be analyzed separately for impairment purposes based on its product type or future plans in reviewing each of our communities we determine if impairment indicators exist on inventory held and used by analyzing a variety of factors including but not limited to the following 

 

if indicators of impairment are present for a community we perform an impairment evaluation of the community which includes an analysis to determine if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts if so impairment charges are recorded to cost of sales if the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying amounts these estimates of cash flows are significantly impacted by community specific factors including estimates of the amounts and timing of future revenues and estimates of the amount of land development materials and labor costs which in turn may be impacted by the following local market conditions 

 

for those assets deemed to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets our determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams when an impairment charge for a community is determined the charge is then allocated to each lot in the community in the same manner as land and development costs are allocated to each lot impairment charges are also recorded on finished homes in substantially completed communities when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values are greater than the fair values less estimated costs to sell these homes 

for the inventory impairment analyses performed during fiscal 2018  we assumed that for the majority of communities sales prices in future periods will be equal to or lower than current sales order prices in each community or in comparable communities in order to generate an acceptable absorption rate the remaining lives of the communities evaluated were estimated to be in a range from one month  to three years  and we utilized a range of discount rates for communities from 10  to 18  

we rarely purchase land for resale however when we own land or communities under development that do not fit into our development and construction plans and we determine that we will sell the asset the project is accounted for as land held for sale if certain criteria are met we record land held for sale at the lesser of its carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell in performing the impairment evaluation for land held for sale we consider several factors including but not limited to recent offers received to purchase the property prices for land in recent comparable sales transactions and market analysis studies which include the estimated price a willing buyer would pay for the land if the estimated fair value less costs to sell an asset is less than the current carrying value the asset is written down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell 

the key assumptions relating to inventory valuations are impacted by local market and economic conditions and are inherently uncertain although our quarterly assessments reflect management’s best estimates due to uncertainties in the estimation process actual results could differ from such estimates 

business acquisitions  — we account for acquisitions of businesses by allocating the purchase price of the business to the various assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired particularly intangible assets these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and our estimates of significant assumptions that a market participant would use when determining fair value while we believe the estimates and assumptions are reasonable they are inherently uncertain unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions 

goodwill  — we record goodwill associated with our acquisitions of businesses when the purchase price of the business exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired we evaluate our goodwill balances for potential impairment on at least an annual basis by comparing the carrying value of each of our operating segments with goodwill to their estimated fair values the estimated fair value is determined by discounting the future cash flows of the operating segment to their present value if the carrying value of the operating segment exceeds its fair value we determine if an impairment exists based on the implied fair value of the operating segment’s goodwill as a result of the goodwill evaluations performed in fiscal 2018  and 2017  no  impairment charges were recorded as a result of the goodwill evaluation performed in fiscal 2016  an impairment charge of 72 million  was recorded to write off the remaining goodwill associated with the huntsville operating segment in the southeast reporting region this operating segment experienced lower levels of profitability than anticipated primarily due to difficult market conditions our total goodwill balance was 1092 million  and 800 million  at september 30 2018  and 2017  respectively 

warranty claims  — we typically provide our homebuyers with a tenyear limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems a twoyear limited warranty on major mechanical systems and a oneyear limited warranty on other construction components since we subcontract our construction work to subcontractors who typically provide us with an indemnity and a certificate of insurance prior to receiving payments for their work claims relating to workmanship and materials are generally the primary responsibility of the subcontractors warranty liabilities have been established by charging cost of sales for each home delivered the amounts charged are based on management’s estimate of expected warrantyrelated costs under all unexpired warranty obligation periods our warranty liability is based upon historical warranty cost experience in each market in which we operate and is adjusted to reflect qualitative risks associated with the types of homes we build and the geographic areas in which we build them actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts a 10 change in the historical warranty rates used to estimate our warranty accrual would not result in a material change in our accrual 

legal claims and insurance  — we are named as a defendant in various claims complaints and other legal actions in the ordinary course of business at any point in time we are managing several hundred individual claims related to construction defect matters personal injury claims employment matters land development issues contract disputes and other matters we have established reserves for these contingencies based on the estimated costs of pending claims and the estimated costs of anticipated future claims related to previously closed homes approximately 99  and 98  of these reserves related to construction defect matters at september 30 2018  and 2017  respectively 

our reserves for construction defect claims include the estimated costs of both known claims and anticipated future claims at september 30 2018  and 2017  we had reserves for approximately 155  and 140  pending construction defect claims respectively and no individual existing claim was material to our financial statements during fiscal 2018  we established reserves for approximately 95  new construction defect claims and resolved 80  construction defect claims for a total cost of 400 million  we have closed a significant number of homes during recent years and we may be subject to future construction defect claims on these homes although regulations vary from state to state construction defect issues can generally be reported for up to ten years after the home has closed in many states in which we operate historical data and trends regarding the frequency of claims incurred and the costs to resolve claims relative to the types of products and markets where we operate are used to estimate the construction defect liabilities for both existing and anticipated future claims these estimates are subject to ongoing revision as the circumstances of individual pending claims and historical data and trends change adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the accounting period in which the change in estimate occurs 

historical trends in construction defect claims have been inconsistent and we believe they may continue to fluctuate housing market conditions have been volatile across most of our markets over the past ten years and we believe such conditions can affect the frequency and cost of construction defect claims if the ultimate resolution of construction defect claims resulting from our home closings in prior years varies from current expectations it could significantly change our estimates regarding the frequency and timing of claims incurred and the costs to resolve existing and anticipated future claims which would impact the construction defect reserves in the future if the frequency of claims incurred or costs of existing and future legal claims significantly exceed our current estimates they will have a significant negative impact on our future earnings and liquidity 

we estimate and record receivables under the applicable insurance policies related to our estimated contingencies for known claims and anticipated future construction defect claims on previously closed homes and other legal claims and lawsuits incurred in the ordinary course of business when recovery is probable additionally we may have the ability to recover a portion of our losses from our subcontractors and their insurance carriers when we have been named as an additional insured on their insurance policies 

the estimation of losses related to these reserves and the related estimates of recoveries from insurance policies are subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends in construction defect claims relative to our markets and the types of products built claim frequency claim settlement costs and patterns insurance industry practices and legal interpretations among others due to the high degree of judgment required in establishing reserves for these contingencies actual future costs and recoveries from insurance could differ significantly from current estimated amounts a 10 increase in the claim frequency and the average cost per claim used to estimate the reserves would result in an increase of approximately 672 million  in our reserves and a 304 million  increase in our receivable resulting in additional expense of 368 million  a 10 decrease in the claim frequency and the average cost per claim would result in a decrease of approximately 604 million  in our reserves and a 227 million  decrease in our receivable resulting in a reduction in expense of 377 million  

income taxes  — we calculate our income tax expense using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and attributable to net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards when assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income in future periods and in the jurisdictions in which those temporary differences become deductible we record a valuation allowance when we determine it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized the accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future results could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position also changes in existing federal and state tax laws and tax rates could affect future tax results and the valuation of our deferred tax assets 

interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in the financial statements as a component of income tax expense significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions we evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis our evaluations are based upon a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change 

stockbased compensation  — our stockholders formally authorize shares of our common stock to be available for future grants of stockbased compensation awards from time to time the compensation committee of our board of directors authorizes the grant of stockbased compensation to our employees and directors from these available shares at september 30 2018  our outstanding stockbased compensation awards include stock options and restricted stock units grants of restricted stock units may vest immediately or over a certain number of years as determined by the compensation committee of our board of directors restricted stock units outstanding at september 30 2018  have a remaining vesting period of 1  to 5 years  stock options are granted at exercise prices which equal the market value of our common stock at the date of the grant the stock options outstanding at september 30 2018  vest during fiscal 2019 and expire 10 years  after the dates on which they were granted 

the compensation expense for stockbased awards is based on the fair value of the award and is recognized on a straightline basis over the remaining vesting period the fair values of restricted stock units are based on our stock price at the date of grant the fair values of stock options granted are calculated on the date of grant using a blackscholes option pricing model determining the fair value of stock options requires judgment in developing assumptions and involves a number of estimates these estimates include but are not limited to the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards the expected dividend yield and expected stock option exercise behavior in addition we also use judgment in estimating the number of stock options that are expected to be forfeited 

fair value measurements  — the financial accounting standards board’s fasb authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes a threelevel hierarchy based upon the inputs to the valuation model of an asset or liability the fair value hierarchy and its application to our assets and liabilities is as follows 

 

when available we use quoted market prices in active markets to determine fair value we consider the principal market and nonperformance risk associated with our counterparties when determining the fair value measurements if applicable fair value measurements are used for our mortgage loans held for sale debt securities collateralized by residential real estate interest rate lock commitments irlcs and other derivative instruments on a recurring basis and are used for inventories other mortgage loans and real estate owned on a nonrecurring basis when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers” which is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance the core principle of this guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2018 and allows for full retrospective or modified retrospective methods of adoption we plan to adopt this standard using the modified retrospective method upon adoption of the standard we expect to record an adjustment to increase retained earnings and recognize a contract asset for expected future insurance brokerage commission renewals we have not yet determined the amount of this adjustment and are continuing to evaluate other effects of the standard but we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in january 2016 the fasb issued asu 201601 “financial instruments  recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities” which addresses certain aspects of recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instruments the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2018 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu 201602 “leases” which requires that lease assets and liabilities be recognized on the balance sheet and that key information about leasing arrangements be disclosed the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2019 although early adoption is permitted we are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in june 2016 the fasb issued asu 201613 “financial instruments  credit losses” which replaces the current incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information in determining credit loss estimates the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2020 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in august 2016 the fasb issued asu 201615 “statement of cash flows  classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments” which amends and clarifies the current guidance to reduce diversity in practice of the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2018 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated statements of cash flows 

in october 2016 the fasb issued asu 201616 “income taxes  intraentity transfers of assets other than inventory” which requires companies to recognize the income tax consequences of an intraentity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2018 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or cash flows 

in november 2016 the fasb issued asu 201618 “statement of cash flows  restricted cash” which requires amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the total beginning and ending amounts for the periods shown on the statement of cash flows the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2018 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or cash flows 

in january 2017 the fasb issued asu 201704 “intangibles  goodwill and other” which simplifies the measurement of goodwill impairment by removing the second step of the goodwill impairment test and requires the determination of the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit under the new guidance goodwill impairment is measured as the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value with the loss recognized limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2020 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in february 2017 the fasb issued asu 201705 “other income  gains and losses from the derecognition of nonfinancial assets” which updates the definition of an in substance nonfinancial asset and clarifies the derecognition guidance for nonfinancial assets to conform to the new revenue recognition standard asu 201409 the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2018 concurrent with the adoption of asu 201409 as required and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in may 2017 the fasb issued asu 201709 “compensation  stock compensation scope of modification accounting” which clarifies which changes to the terms or conditions of a sharebased payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting under the new guidance modification accounting is required if the fair value vesting conditions or classification equity or liability of the new award are different from the original award immediately before the original award is modified the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2018 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

we are subject to interest rate risk on our longterm debt we monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and utilize both fixed and variable rate debt for fixed rate debt changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows conversely for variable rate debt changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument but may affect our future earnings and cash flows except in very limited circumstances we do not have an obligation to prepay fixedrate debt prior to maturity and as a result interest rate risk and changes in fair value would not have a significant impact on our cash flows related to our fixedrate debt until such time as we are required to refinance repurchase or repay such debt 

we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with our mortgage loan origination services we manage interest rate risk through the use of forward sales of mortgagebacked securities mbs which are referred to as “hedging instruments” in the following discussion we do not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate lock commitments irlcs are extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and who meet defined credit and underwriting criteria typically the irlcs have a duration of less than six months some irlcs are committed immediately to a specific purchaser through the use of bestefforts whole loan delivery commitments while other irlcs are funded prior to being committed to thirdparty purchasers the hedging instruments related to irlcs are classified and accounted for as derivative instruments in an economic hedge with gains and losses recognized in revenues in the consolidated statements of operations hedging instruments related to funded uncommitted loans are accounted for at fair value with changes recognized in revenues in the consolidated statements of operations along with changes in the fair value of the funded uncommitted loans the fair value change related to the hedging instruments generally offsets the fair value change in the uncommitted loans the net fair value change which for the years ended september 30 2018  and 2017  was not significant is recognized in current earnings at september 30 2018  hedging instruments used to mitigate interest rate risk related to uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale and uncommitted irlcs totaled a notional amount of 10 billion  uncommitted irlcs totaled a notional amount of approximately 4597 million  and uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale totaled a notional amount of approximately 5759 million  at september 30 2018  

the following table sets forth principal cash flows by scheduled maturity effective weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value of our debt obligations as of september 30 2018  because the mortgage repurchase facility is effectively secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale that are typically sold within 60 days its outstanding balance is included in the most current period presented the interest rate for our variable rate debt represents the weighted average interest rate in effect at september 30 2018

operating structure and processes 

following is an overview of our company’s operating structure and the significant processes that support our business controls strategies and performance 

homebuilding markets 

our homebuilding business began in the dallasfort worth area which is still one of our largest homebuilding operations and home to our corporate headquarters we currently operate in 26 states and 79  markets which provides us with geographic diversification in our homebuilding inventory investments and our sources of revenues and earnings we believe our geographic diversification lowers our operational risks by mitigating the effects of local and regional economic cycles and it also enhances our earnings potential by providing more diverse opportunities to invest in our business 

we conduct our homebuilding operations in the geographic regions states and markets listed below and we conduct our financial services operations in many of these markets our homebuilding operating divisions are aggregated into six  reporting segments also referred to as reporting regions which comprise the markets below our financial statements and the notes thereto contain additional information regarding segment performance 



when evaluating new or existing homebuilding markets for purposes of capital allocation we consider local marketspecific factors including among others 

 

economies of scale 

we are the largest homebuilding company in the united states in fiscal 2017  as measured by number of homes closed and revenues and we are also one of the largest builders in many of the markets in which we operate we believe that our national regional and local scale of operations provides us with benefits that may not be available to the same degree to some other smaller homebuilders such as 

 

decentralized homebuilding operations 

we view homebuilding as a local business therefore most of our direct homebuilding activities are decentralized to provide flexibility to our local managers on operational decisions we believe that our local management teams who are familiar with local conditions have the best information to make many decisions regarding their operations at september 30 2017  we had 41  separate homebuilding operating divisions many of which operate in more than one market area generally each operating division consists of a division president a controller land entitlement acquisition and development personnel a sales manager and sales and marketing personnel a construction manager and construction superintendents customer service personnel a purchasing manager and office staff our division presidents receive performancebased compensation if they achieve targeted financial and operating metrics related to their operating divisions following is a summary of our homebuilding activities that are decentralized in our local operating divisions and the control and oversight functions that are centralized in our regional and corporate offices 

operating division responsibilities 

each operating division is responsible for 

 — a feasibility study 

— soil and environmental reviews 

— review of existing zoning and other governmental requirements 

— review of the need for and extent of offsite work required to obtain project entitlements and 

— financial analysis of the potential project 

 

centralized controls 

we centralize many important risk elements of our homebuilding business through our regional and corporate offices we have five separate homebuilding regional offices generally each regional office consists of a region president a chief financial officer legal counsel and other operational and office support staff each of our region presidents and their management teams are responsible for oversight of the operations of a number of homebuilding operating divisions including 

 

our corporate executives and corporate office departments are responsible for establishing our operational policies and internal control standards and for monitoring compliance with established policies and controls throughout our operations the corporate office also has primary responsibility for direct management of certain key risk elements and initiatives through the following centralized functions 

 

landlot acquisition and inventory management 

we acquire land for use in our homebuilding operations after we have completed due diligence and generally after we have obtained the rights known as entitlements to begin development or construction work resulting in an acceptable number of residential lots before we acquire lots or tracts of land we complete a feasibility study which includes soil tests independent environmental studies other engineering work and financial analysis we also evaluate the status of necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements required to develop and use the property for home construction although we purchase and develop land primarily to support our homebuilding activities we may sell land and lots to other developers and homebuilders where we have excess land and lot positions or for other strategic reasons 

we also enter into landlot option contracts in which we obtain the right but generally not the obligation to buy land or lots at predetermined prices on a defined schedule commensurate with anticipated home closings or planned development our option contracts generally are nonrecourse which limits our financial exposure to our earnest money deposited into escrow under the terms of the contract and any preacquisition due diligence costs we incur this enables us to control land and lot positions with limited capital investment which substantially reduces the risks associated with land ownership and development 

we directly acquire almost all of our land and lot positions we are a party to a small number of joint ventures all of which are consolidated in our financial statements 

we attempt to mitigate our exposure to real estate inventory risks by 

 

land development and home construction 

substantially all of our land development and home construction work is performed by subcontractors subcontractors typically are selected after a competitive bidding process and are retained for a specific subdivision or series of house plans pursuant to a contract that obligates the subcontractor to complete the scope of work at an agreedupon price we employ land development managers and construction superintendents to monitor land development and home construction activities participate in major design and building decisions coordinate the activities of subcontractors and suppliers review the work of subcontractors for quality and cost controls and monitor compliance with zoning and building codes in addition our construction superintendents interact with our homebuyers during the construction process and instruct buyers on postclosing home maintenance 

our home designs are selected or prepared in each of our markets to appeal to the preferences of local homebuyers in each community our local management teams regularly adjust our product offerings to address our customers’ expectations for affordability home size and features in many communities we offer optional interior and exterior features to homebuyers for an additional charge construction time for our homes depends on the availability of labor materials and supplies the weather the size of the home and other factors we complete the construction of most homes within two  to six months  

we typically do not maintain significant inventories of land development or construction materials except for work in progress materials for active development projects and homes under construction generally the construction materials used in our operations are readily available from numerous sources we have contracts exceeding one year with certain suppliers of building materials that are cancelable at our option 

we are subject to governmental regulations that affect our land development and construction operations at times we have experienced delays in receiving the proper approvals from municipalities or other government agencies that have delayed our anticipated development and construction activities in certain communities 

cost controls 

we control construction costs by designing our homes efficiently and by obtaining competitive bids for construction materials and labor we also competitively bid and negotiate pricing from our subcontractors and suppliers based on the volume of services and products we purchase on a local regional and national basis we monitor our land development expenditures and construction costs versus budgets for each house and community and we review our inventory levels margins expenses profitability and returns for each operating market compared to both its business plan and our performance expectations 

we control overhead costs by centralizing certain accounting and administrative functions and by monitoring staffing and compensation levels we review other general and administrative costs to identify efficiencies and savings opportunities in our operating divisions and our regional and corporate offices we also direct many of our promotional activities toward local real estate brokers and digital marketing initiatives which we believe are efficient uses of our marketing expenditures 

marketing and sales 

we use the dr horton emerald homes express homes and freedom homes brand names to market and sell our homes our dr horton branded communities are the core of our business and account for the majority of our home closings focusing on the first time and first time moveup homebuyer our emerald branded communities appeal to buyers in search of higherend moveup and luxury homes our express branded communities primarily accommodate a segment of entrylevel buyers who are focused on affordability we introduced our freedom homes brand in late fiscal 2016 to offer affordable homes to active adult buyers seeking a lowmaintenance lifestyle the percentage of home closings and home sales revenue contributed by each brand during fiscal 2017  was as follows 



we also use the pacific ridge homes brand in our seattle market following our acquisition of their homebuilding operations in fiscal 2015 and their product offerings are similar to and included with our dr horton branded communities shown above 

we market and sell our homes primarily through commissioned employees and the majority of our home closings also involve an independent real estate broker we typically conduct home sales from sales offices located in furnished model homes in each subdivision and we generally do not offer our model homes for sale until the completion of a subdivision our sales personnel assist prospective homebuyers by providing floor plans and price information demonstrating the features and layouts of our homes and assisting with the selection of options when available we train and inform our sales personnel as to the availability of financing construction schedules and marketing and advertising plans as market conditions warrant we may provide potential homebuyers with incentives such as discounts or free upgrades to be competitive in a particular market or to attain our targeted sales pace 

we market our homes and communities to prospective homebuyers and real estate brokers digitally through email search engine marketing social media and our company website and other real estate websites in addition to print media and advertisement we also use billboards radio television magazine and newspaper advertising locally as necessary we attempt to position our subdivisions in locations that are desirable to potential homebuyers and convenient to or visible from local traffic patterns which helps to reduce advertising costs model homes play an important role in our marketing efforts and we expend significant effort and resources to create an attractive atmosphere in our model homes 

we also build speculative homes in most of our communities which allow us to compete effectively with existing homes available in the market and improve our profits and returns these homes enhance our marketing and sales efforts to prospective homebuyers who are renters or who are relocating to these markets and require a home within a short time frame as well as to independent brokers who represent these homebuyers we determine our speculative homes strategy in each market based on local market factors such as new job growth the number of job relocations housing demand and supply seasonality current sales contract cancellation trends and our past experience in the market we maintain a level of speculative home inventory in each community based on our current and planned sales pace and we monitor and adjust speculative home inventory on an ongoing basis as conditions warrant 

sales contracts and backlog 

our sales contracts require an earnest money deposit which varies in amount across our markets and communities additionally customers are generally required to pay additional deposits when they select options or upgrade features for their homes our sales contracts include a financing contingency which permits customers to cancel and receive a refund of their deposit if they cannot obtain mortgage financing at prevailing or specified interest rates within a specified period our contracts may include other contingencies such as the sale of an existing home we either retain or refund customer deposits on cancelled sales contracts depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances 

sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period at september 30 2017  the value of our backlog of sales orders was 37 billion   12329  homes an increase  of 8  from 34 billion   11475  homes at september 30 2016  the average sales price of homes in backlog was 302200  at september 30 2017  up   1  from the 299600  average at september 30 2016  many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies such as those described above which can result in cancellations a portion of the contracts in backlog will not result in closings due to cancellations as a percentage of gross sales orders cancellations of sales contracts were 22  and 23  in fiscal 2017  and 2016  respectively 

the length of time between the signing of a sales contract for a home and delivery of the home to the buyer closing is generally from two  to six months  therefore substantially all of the homes in our sales backlog at september 30 2017  are scheduled to close in fiscal year 2018  

customer service and quality control 

our operating divisions are responsible for preclosing quality control inspections and responding to customers’ postclosing needs we believe that a prompt and courteous response to homebuyers’ needs during and after construction reduces postclosing repair costs enhances our reputation for quality and service and ultimately leads to repeat and referral business from the real estate community and homebuyers we typically provide our homebuyers with a tenyear limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems a twoyear limited warranty on major mechanical systems and a oneyear limited warranty on other construction components the subcontractors who perform the actual construction also provide us with warranties on workmanship and are generally prepared to respond to us and the homeowner promptly upon request in addition some of our suppliers provide manufacturer’s warranties on specified products installed in the home 

customer mortgage financing 

we provide mortgage financing services principally to purchasers of our homes in the majority of our homebuilding markets through dhi mortgage our 100 owned subsidiary dhi mortgage assists in the sales transaction by coordinating the mortgage application mortgage commitment and home closing processes to facilitate a timely and efficient home buying experience for our buyers during the year ended september 30 2017  dhi mortgage provided mortgage financing services for approximately 56  of our total homes closed and approximately 95  of dhi mortgage’s loan volume related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations most of our homebuilding divisions also work with a number of additional mortgage lenders that offer a range of mortgage financing programs to our homebuyers 

to limit the risks associated with our mortgage operations dhi mortgage originates loan products that we believe can be sold to thirdparty purchasers of mortgage loans the majority of which are eligible for sale to the federal national mortgage association fannie mae the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac or the government national mortgage association ginnie mae dhi mortgage sells substantially all of the loans and their servicing rights to thirdparty purchasers shortly after origination with limited recourse provisions dhi mortgage centralizes most of its control and oversight functions including those related to loan underwriting quality control regulatory compliance secondary marketing of loans hedging activities accounting and financial reporting 

title services 

through our subsidiary title companies we serve as a title insurance agent in selected markets by providing title insurance policies examination and closing services primarily to our homebuilding customers we currently assume little or no underwriting risk associated with these title policies 

employees 

at september 30 2017  we employed 7735 persons of whom 1673  were sales and marketing personnel 2157  were involved in construction 2107  were office personnel and 1798  worked in mortgage and title operations we focus significant attention toward attracting and retaining talented and experienced individuals to manage and support our operations and we believe that we have good relations with our employees 

recent business acquisitions 

we routinely evaluate opportunities to profitably expand our operations including potential acquisitions of other homebuilding or related businesses acquisitions of homebuilding businesses usually provide us with immediate land and home inventories and control of additional land and lot positions through option contracts also employees of acquired businesses generally have specialized knowledge of local market conditions including existing relationships with municipalities land owners developers subcontractors and suppliers these inventory positions and local market knowledge and relationships could take us several years to develop through our own efforts we seek to limit the risks associated with acquiring other companies by conducting extensive operational financial and legal due diligence on each acquisition and by performing financial analysis to determine that each acquisition will have a positive impact on our earnings within an acceptable period of time 

in september 2016  we acquired the homebuilding operations of wilson parker homes which operated in atlanta and augusta georgia raleigh north carolina columbia south carolina and phoenix arizona 

subsequent to september 30 2017 we acquired 75  of the outstanding shares of forestar group inc forestar for 5583 million  in cash pursuant to the terms of the june 2017 merger agreement forestar is and will continue to be a publiclytraded residential and real estate development company with operations currently in 14  markets and 10  states where it owns directly or through joint ventures interests in 44  residential and mixeduse projects our alignment with forestar advances our strategy of increasing our access to highquality optioned land and lot positions to enhance operational efficiency and returns both companies are identifying land development opportunities to expand forestar’s platform and we plan to acquire a large portion of forestar’s finished lots in accordance with the master supply agreement between the two companies 

competition 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous other national regional and local homebuilders for homebuyers desirable land raw materials skilled labor employees management talent and financing we also compete with resales of existing and foreclosed homes and with the rental housing market our homes compete on the basis of quality price location design and mortgage financing terms 

the competitors to our financial services businesses include other mortgage lenders and title companies including national regional and local mortgage bankers and other financial institutions some of these competitors are subject to fewer governmental regulations and may have greater access to capital and some of them may operate with different lending criteria and may offer a broader array of financing and other products and services to consumers than we do however we work diligently to provide flexible fairly priced financing alternatives subject to applicable regulation 

governmental regulation and environmental matters 

the homebuilding industry is subject to extensive and complex regulations we and the subcontractors we use must comply with many federal state and local laws and regulations these include zoning density and development requirements and building environmental advertising labor and real estate sales rules and regulations these regulations and requirements affect substantially all aspects of our land development and home design construction and sales processes in varying degrees across our markets our homes are inspected by local authorities where required and homes eligible for insurance or guarantees provided by the federal housing administration fha and the department of veteran affairs va are subject to inspection by them these regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities in addition our new housing developments may be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets utilities and other public improvements 

our homebuilding operations are also subject to an extensive array of local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning protection of health safety and the environment the particular environmental laws for each site vary greatly according to location environmental condition and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties 

our mortgage company must comply with extensive state and federal laws and regulations which are administered by numerous agencies including but not limited to the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb federal housing finance agency us department of housing and urban development fha va united states department of agriculture usda fannie mae freddie mac and ginnie mae these laws and regulations include many compliance requirements including but not limited to licensing consumer disclosures fair lending and real estate settlement procedures as a result our operations are subject to regular extensive examinations by the applicable agencies 

seasonality 

although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again in the future we generally close more homes and generate greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year the seasonal nature of our business can also cause significant variations in our working capital requirements in both our homebuilding and financial services operations as a result of seasonal activity our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend 

discussion of our business and operations included in this annual report on form 10k should be read together with the risk factors set forth below they describe various risks and uncertainties we are or may become subject to many of which are difficult to predict or beyond our control these risks and uncertainties together with other factors described elsewhere in this report have the potential to affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner 

the homebuilding industry is cyclical and affected by changes in economic real estate or other conditions that could adversely affect our business or financial results 

the homebuilding industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic and real estate conditions such as 

 

adverse changes in these general and local economic conditions or deterioration in the broader economy would cause a negative impact on our business and financial results and increase the risk for asset impairments and writeoffs changes in these economic conditions may affect some of our regions or markets more than others if adverse conditions affect our larger markets they could have a proportionately greater impact on us than on some other homebuilding companies 

in the past concerns regarding the federal government’s fiscal policies and economic stimulus actions have created uncertainty in the financial markets and caused volatility in interest rates which has impacted business and consumer confidence federal government actions and new legislation related to economic stimulus taxation spending levels and borrowing limits along with the related political debates conflicts and compromises associated with such actions may negatively impact the financial markets and consumer confidence such events could hurt the us economy and the housing market and in turn could adversely affect the operating results of our homebuilding financial services and other businesses 

weather conditions and natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes volcanic activity droughts and floods heavy or prolonged precipitation or wildfires can harm our homebuilding business these can delay our development work home construction and home closings adversely affect the cost or availability of materials or labor or damage homes under construction the climates and geology of many of the states in which we operate including california florida texas and other coastal areas where we have some of our larger operations and which have experienced recent natural disasters present increased risks of adverse weather or natural disasters 

deployments of us military personnel to foreign regions terrorist attacks other acts of violence or threats to national security and any corresponding response by the united states or others related domestic or international instability or civil unrest may cause an economic slowdown in the markets where we operate which could adversely affect our homebuilding business 

public health issues such as a major epidemic or pandemic could adversely affect our business the us and other countries have experienced and may experience in the future outbreaks of contagious diseases that affect public perception of health risk in the event of a widespread prolonged actual or perceived outbreak of a contagious disease our operations could be negatively impacted by a reduction in customer traffic or other factors which could reduce demand for new homes 

if we experience any of the foregoing potential customers may be less willing or able to buy our homes in the future our pricing and product strategies may also be limited by market conditions we may be unable to change the mix of our home offerings reduce the costs of the homes we build offer more affordable homes or satisfactorily address changing market conditions in other ways without adversely affecting our profit margins in addition cancellations of home sales contracts in backlog may increase if homebuyers do not honor their contracts due to any of the factors discussed above 

our financial services business is closely related to our homebuilding business as it originates mortgage loans principally to purchasers of the homes we build a decrease in the demand for our homes because of the foregoing matters will also adversely affect the financial results of this segment of our business an increase in the default rate on the mortgages we originate may adversely affect our ability to sell the mortgages or the pricing we receive upon the sale of mortgages or may increase our recourse obligations for previous originations we may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to thirdparty purchasers in the event of errors or omissions relating to certain representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the type of collateral the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in the connection with the loan we establish reserves related to mortgages we have sold however actual future obligations related to these mortgages could differ significantly from our current estimated amounts 

constriction of the credit markets could limit our ability to access capital and increase our costs of capital 

during past economic and housing downturns the credit markets constricted and reduced some sources of liquidity that were previously available to us consequently we relied principally on our cash on hand to meet our working capital needs and repay outstanding indebtedness during those times there likely will be periods in the future when financial market upheaval will increase our cost of capital or limit our ability to access the public debt markets or obtain bank financing 

we have a 1275 billion  senior unsecured revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to 19 billion  subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments the facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit equal to approximately 50  of the revolving credit commitment the maturity date of the commitments under the facility is september 25 2022  also our mortgage subsidiary utilizes a 600 million  mortgage repurchase facility to finance the majority of the loans it originates the capacity of the facility increases without requiring additional commitments to 725 million  for approximately 30 days at each quarter end and to 800 million  for approximately 45 days at fiscal year end the capacity can also be increased to 10 billion  subject to the availability of additional commitments the mortgage repurchase facility must be renewed annually and currently expires on february 23 2018  we expect to renew and extend the term of the mortgage repurchase facility with similar terms prior to its maturity adverse changes in market conditions could make the renewal of these facilities more difficult or could result in an increase in the cost of these facilities or a decrease in the committed amounts such changes affecting our mortgage repurchase facility may also make it more difficult or costly to sell the mortgages that we originate 

we regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund growth in our business repay debt obligations and support other general corporate and operational needs and we regularly evaluate our opportunities to raise additional capital we have an automatically effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec in august 2015 registering debt and equity securities that we may issue from time to time in amounts to be determined as market conditions permit we may issue new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets or obtain additional bank financing to fund our projected capital requirements or provide additional liquidity in october 2017  we used cash on hand to purchase 75  of the outstanding shares of forestar group inc forestar for 5583 million  we believe that our existing cash resources our revolving credit facility our mortgage repurchase facility and our ability to access the capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our working capital needs and debt obligations including the maturity of 400 million  principal amount of senior notes in fiscal 2018  adverse changes in economic homebuilding or capital market conditions could negatively affect our business liquidity and financial results restrict our ability to obtain additional capital or increase our costs of capital 

reductions in the availability of mortgage financing provided by government agencies changes in government financing programs a decrease in our ability to sell mortgage loans on attractive terms or an increase in mortgage interest rates could decrease our buyers’ ability to obtain financing and adversely affect our business or financial results 

the mortgage loans originated by our financial services operations are primarily eligible for sale to fannie mae freddie mac and ginnie mae and are sold to thirdparty purchasers the secondary market for mortgage loans continues to primarily desire securities backed by fannie mae freddie mac or ginnie mae and we believe the liquidity these agencies provide to the mortgage industry is important to the housing market there have been ongoing discussions within the government regarding the longterm structure and viability of fannie mae and freddie mac which could result in adjustments to the size of their loan portfolios and to guidelines for their loan products any reduction in the availability of financing provided by these institutions could adversely affect interest rates mortgage availability and sales of new homes and mortgage loans during fiscal 2017  approximately 84  of our mortgage loans were sold to three  major financial entities one of which purchased 45  of the total loans sold on an ongoing basis we seek to establish loan purchase arrangements with additional financial entities if we are unable to sell mortgage loans to purchasers on attractive terms our ability to originate and sell mortgage loans at competitive prices could be limited which would negatively affect our profitability 

the fha insures mortgage loans that generally have lower credit requirements and is an important source for financing the sale of our homes changes restrictions or significant premium increases in fha programs in the future may negatively affect the availability or affordability of fha financing which could adversely affect our ability to sell homes 

some of our customers may qualify for 100 financing through programs offered by the va usda and certain other housing finance agencies these programs are subject to changes in regulations lending standards and government funding levels there can be no assurances that these programs or other programs will continue to be available in our homebuilding markets or that they will be as attractive to our customers as the programs currently offered which could negatively affect our sales 

mortgage rates are currently low as compared to most historical periods however they are expected to increase as the federal reserve board has raised its benchmark rate several times over the past year and has indicated further interest rate increases are likely when interest rates increase the cost of owning a home will increase which will likely reduce the number of potential homebuyers who can obtain mortgage financing and could result in a decline in the demand for our homes 

the risks associated with our land and lot inventory could adversely affect our business or financial results 

inventory risks are substantial for our homebuilding business there are risks inherent in controlling owning and developing land if housing demand declines we may not be able to build and sell homes profitably in some of our communities and we may not be able to fully recover the costs of some of the land and lots we own also the values of our owned undeveloped land lots and housing inventories may fluctuate significantly due to changes in market conditions as a result our deposits for lots controlled under option or similar contracts may be put at risk we may have to sell homes or land for a lower profit margin or record inventory impairment charges on our land and lots a significant deterioration in economic or homebuilding industry conditions may result in substantial inventory impairment charges 

we cannot make any assurances that our growth strategies acquisitions or investments will be successful or will not expose us to additional risks or other negative consequences 

in recent years we have primarily grown our business by increasing our investments in land lot and home inventories in our existing homebuilding markets we have also expanded through investments in new product offerings and in new geographic markets investments in land lots and home inventories can expose us to risks of economic loss and inventory impairments if housing conditions weaken or if we are unsuccessful in implementing our growth strategies 

subsequent to september 30 2017 we made an investment of 5583 million  in cash to acquire 75  of the outstanding shares of forestar pursuant to the terms of the june 2017 merger agreement forestar is and will continue to be a publiclytraded residential and real estate development company with operations currently in 14  markets and 10  states where it owns directly or through joint ventures interests in 44  residential and mixeduse projects our alignment with forestar advances our strategy of increasing our access to highquality optioned land and lot positions to enhance operational efficiency and returns both companies are identifying land development opportunities to expand forestar’s platform and we plan to acquire a large portion of forestar’s finished lots in accordance with the master supply agreement between the two companies 

in addition to the investment and merger with forestar we have acquired the homebuilding operations of several companies since fiscal 2012 and we may make strategic acquisitions of or investments in other companies operations or assets in the future such acquisitions and investments may have risks similar to those related to land lots and home inventories but they may also expose us to additional risks or other negative consequences these transactions may not advance our business strategy provide a satisfactory return on our investment or provide other benefits we anticipate also the integration of these transactions may not be successful and may require significant time and resources which may divert management’s attention from other operations acquisitions and investments could also expose us to material liabilities not discovered in the due diligence process and may lead to litigation if these transactions underperform our expectations or are unsuccessful we may incur significant expenses or writeoffs of inventory other assets or intangible assets such as goodwill acquisitions and investments can result in dilution to existing stockholders if we issue our common stock as consideration and can increase our debt levels or reduce our liquidity if we purchase them with cash the magnitude timing and nature of any future acquisitions or investments will depend on a number of factors including our ability to identify suitable additional markets or acquisition candidates the negotiation of acceptable terms our financial capabilities and general economic and business conditions we also may seek to divest an investment or a business and may have difficulty selling such investment or business on acceptable terms in a timely manner 

homebuilding is subject to home warranty and construction defect claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant 

we are subject to home warranty and construction defect claims arising in the ordinary course of our homebuilding business we rely on subcontractors to perform the actual construction of our homes and in many cases to select and obtain construction materials despite our detailed specifications and monitoring of the construction process our subcontractors occasionally do not meet adequate quality standards in the construction of our homes when we find these issues we repair them in accordance with our warranty obligations we spend significant resources to repair items in homes we have sold to fulfill the warranties we issued to our homebuyers additionally we are subject to construction defect claims which can be costly to defend and resolve in the legal system warranty and construction defect matters can also result in negative publicity in the media and on the internet which can damage our reputation and adversely affect our ability to sell homes 

based on the large number of homes we have sold over the years our potential liabilities related to warranty and construction defect claims are significant as a consequence we maintain product liability insurance and we seek to obtain indemnities and certificates of insurance from subcontractors covering claims related to their workmanship and materials we establish warranty and other reserves for the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built because of the uncertainties inherent to these matters we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will be adequate to address all of our future warranty and construction defect claims contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce we may be responsible for applicable selfinsured retentions and some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits additionally the coverage offered by and the availability of product liability insurance for construction defects is limited and costly we have responded to increases in insurance costs and coverage limitations by increasing our selfinsured retentions and claim reserves there can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted or become more costly if costs to resolve our future warranty and construction defect claims exceed our estimates our financial results and liquidity could be adversely affected 

a health and safety incident relating to our operations could be costly in terms of potential liability and reputational damage 

  

building sites are inherently dangerous and operating in the homebuilding industry poses certain inherent health and safety risks due to health and safety regulatory requirements and the number of homes we construct health and safety performance is critical to the success of our business any failure in health and safety performance may result in penalties for noncompliance with relevant regulatory requirements and a failure that results in a major or significant health and safety incident is likely to be costly and could expose us to liability that could be costly such an incident could generate significant negative publicity and have a corresponding impact on our reputation our relationships with relevant regulatory agencies or governmental authorities and our ability to attract customers and employees which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and liquidity 

damage to our corporate reputation or brands from negative publicity could adversely affect our business financial results andor stock price 

adverse publicity related to our company industry personnel operations or business performance may cause damage to our corporate reputation or brands and may generate negative sentiment potentially affecting the performance of our business or our stock price regardless of its accuracy or inaccuracy negative publicity can be disseminated rapidly through digital platforms including social media websites blogs and newsletters customers and other interested parties value readily available information and often act on such information without further investigation and without regard to its accuracy the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction and our success in preserving our brand image depends on our ability to recognize respond to and effectively manage negative publicity in a rapidly changing environment adverse publicity or unfavorable commentary from any source could damage our reputation reduce the demand for our homes or negatively impact the morale and performance of our employees which could adversely affect our business 

supply shortages and other risks related to acquiring land building materials and skilled labor could increase our costs and delay deliveries 

the homebuilding industry has from time to time experienced significant difficulties that can affect the cost or timing of construction including 

 

these factors may increase our build times or cause us to incur more costs building our homes if the level of new home demand increases significantly in future periods the risk of shortages in residential lots labor and materials available to the homebuilding industry will likely increase 

our business and financial results could be adversely affected by significant inflation higher interest rates or deflation 

inflation can adversely affect us by increasing costs of land materials and labor in addition significant inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates which have a negative impact on housing affordability in a highly inflationary environment depending on industry and other economic conditions we may be precluded from raising home prices enough to keep up with the rate of inflation which could reduce our profit margins moreover with inflation the costs of capital labor and materials can increase and the purchasing power of our cash resources can decline current or future efforts by the government to stimulate the economy may increase the risk of significant inflation and its adverse impact on our business or financial results 

alternatively a significant period of deflation could cause a decrease in overall spending and borrowing levels this could lead to deterioration in economic conditions including an increase in the rate of unemployment deflation could also cause the value of our inventories to decline or reduce the value of existing homes below the related mortgage loan balance which could potentially increase the supply of existing homes if oil prices decline significantly economic conditions in markets that have significant exposure to the energy sector may weaken these or other factors that increase the risk of significant deflation could have a negative impact on our business or financial results 

we are required to obtain performance bonds the unavailability of which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

we often are required to provide surety bonds to secure our performance or obligations under construction contracts development agreements and other arrangements at september 30 2017  we had 12 billion  of outstanding surety bonds our ability to obtain surety bonds primarily depends upon our credit rating financial condition past performance and other factors including the capacity of the surety market and the underwriting practices of surety bond issuers the ability to obtain surety bonds also can be impacted by the willingness of insurance companies to issue performance bonds for construction and development activities if we are unable to obtain surety bonds when required our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

increases in the costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business or financial results 

significant expenses of owning a home including mortgage interest and real estate taxes generally are deductible expenses for an individual’s federal and in some cases state income taxes subject to various limitations under current tax law and policy if the federal government or a state government changes its income tax laws as has been discussed from time to time to eliminate or substantially modify these income tax deductions the aftertax cost of owning a new home would increase for many of our potential customers the loss or reduction of homeowner tax deductions if such tax law changes were enacted without offsetting provisions could adversely affect demand for and sales prices of new homes 

in addition increases in property tax rates by local governmental authorities as experienced in some areas in response to reduced federal and state funding could adversely affect the amount of financing our potential customers could obtain or their desire to purchase new homes 

governmental regulations and environmental matters could increase the cost and limit the availability of our development and homebuilding projects and adversely affect our business or financial results 

we are subject to extensive and complex regulations that affect land development and home construction including zoning density restrictions building design and building standards these regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities as to the conditions we must meet prior to development or construction being approved if approved at all we are subject to determinations by these authorities as to the adequacy of water or sewage facilities roads or other local services new housing developments may also be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets and other public improvements in addition in many markets government authorities have implemented no growth or growth control initiatives any of these may limit delay or increase the costs of development or home construction 

we are also subject to a significant number and variety of local state and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of health safety labor standards and the environment the impact of environmental laws varies depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available these matters may result in delays may cause us to incur substantial compliance remediation mitigation and other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas government agencies also routinely initiate audits reviews or investigations of our business practices to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations which can cause us to incur costs or create other disruptions in our business that can be significant for example we have received notices of violation from the united states environmental protection agency related to stormwater compliance at certain of our sites in the southeast this matter could potentially result in requirements for us to perform additional compliance procedures and to pay monetary sanctions 

the subcontractors we rely on to perform the actual construction of our homes are also subject to a significant number of local state and federal laws and regulations including laws involving matters that are not within our control if the subcontractors who construct our homes fail to comply with all applicable laws we can suffer reputational damage and may be exposed to possible liability 

we are also subject to an extensive number of laws and regulations because our common stock and debt securities are publicly traded in the capital markets these regulations govern our communications with our shareholders and the capital markets our financial statement disclosures and our legal processes and they also impact the work required to be performed by our independent registered public accounting firm and our legal counsel changes in these laws and regulations including the subsequent implementation of rules by the administering government authorities may require us to incur additional compliance costs and such costs may be significant 

governmental regulation of our financial services operations could adversely affect our business or financial results 

our financial services operations are subject to extensive state and federal laws and regulations which are administered by numerous agencies including but not limited to the cfpb federal housing finance agency us department of housing and urban development fha va usda fannie mae freddie mac and ginnie mae these laws and regulations include many compliance requirements including but not limited to licensing consumer disclosures fair lending and real estate settlement procedures as a result our operations are subject to regular extensive examinations by the applicable agencies 

in fiscal 2013 our mortgage subsidiary was subpoenaed by the united states department of justice doj regarding the adequacy of certain underwriting and quality control processes related to fha loans originated and sold in prior years we have provided information related to these loans and our processes to the   doj and communications are ongoing the doj has to date not asserted any formal claim amount penalty or fine 

due to the significant increases in regulations operating costs have increased for our mortgage operations the possibility of additional future regulations changing rule interpretations and examinations by regulatory agencies may result in more stringent compliance standards and could adversely affect the results of our operations 

we have significant amounts of consolidated debt and may incur additional debt our debt obligations and our ability to comply with related covenants restrictions or limitations could adversely affect our financial condition 

as of september 30 2017  our consolidated debt was 29 billion  and we had 8296 million  principal amount of our debt maturing before the end of fiscal 2018  including 400 million  principal amount of senior notes and 420 million  outstanding under the mortgage repurchase facility the indenture governing our senior notes does not restrict the incurrence of future unsecured debt by us or our homebuilding subsidiaries or the incurrence of secured or unsecured debt by our financial services subsidiaries and the agreement governing our revolving credit facility allows us to incur a substantial amount of future unsecured debt also the indenture governing our senior notes and the agreement governing our revolving credit facility impose restrictions on our ability and on that of the guarantors to incur debt secured by certain assets but still permit us and our homebuilding subsidiaries to incur significant amounts of additional secured debt 

possible consequences the amount and the maturities of our debt could have important consequences for example they could 

 

in addition our debt obligations and the restrictions imposed by the instruments governing those obligations expose us to additional risks including 

dependence on future performance our ability to meet our debt service and other obligations and the financial covenants under our revolving credit and mortgage repurchase facilities will depend in part upon our future financial performance our future results are subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report our revenues and earnings vary with the level of general economic activity in the markets we serve our businesses are also affected by financial political business and other factors many of which are beyond our control the factors that affect our ability to generate cash can also affect our ability to raise additional funds for these purposes through the sale of debt or equity the refinancing of debt or the sale of assets changes in prevailing interest rates may affect the cost of our debt service obligations because borrowings under our revolving credit facility and mortgage repurchase facility bear interest at floating rates 

revolving credit facility our revolving credit facility contains financial covenants requiring the maintenance of a maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and a borrowing base restriction if our ratio of debt to tangible net worth exceeds a certain level a failure to comply with these requirements could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under our revolving credit facility or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity 

mortgage repurchase facility and other restrictions the mortgage repurchase facility for our mortgage subsidiary requires the maintenance of a minimum level of tangible net worth a maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and a minimum level of liquidity by our mortgage subsidiary a failure to comply with these requirements could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds to our mortgage subsidiary or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity any difficulty experienced in complying with these covenants could make the renewal of the facility more difficult or costly 

in addition although our financial services business is conducted through subsidiaries that are not restricted by the indenture governing our senior notes or the agreement governing our revolving credit facility the ability of our financial services subsidiaries to distribute funds to our homebuilding operations would be restricted in the event such distribution would cause an event of default under the mortgage repurchase facility or if an event of default had occurred under this facility moreover our right to receive assets from these subsidiaries upon their liquidation or recapitalization is subject to the prior claims of the creditors of these subsidiaries any claims we may have to funds from our financial services subsidiaries would be subordinate to subsidiary indebtedness to the extent of any security for such indebtedness and to any indebtedness otherwise recognized as senior to our claims 

changes in debt ratings our senior unsecured debt is currently rated investment grade by all three major rating agencies however there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain this rating any lowering of our debt ratings could make accessing the public capital markets or obtaining additional credit from banks more difficult andor more expensive 

change of control purchase options and change of control default  upon the occurrence of both a change of control and a ratings downgrade event each as defined in the indenture governing our senior notes we will be required to offer to repurchase such notes at 101  of their principal amount together with all accrued and unpaid interest if any moreover a change of control as defined in our revolving credit facility would constitute an event of default under our revolving credit facility which could result in the acceleration of the repayment of any borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility a requirement to cash collateralize all letters of credit outstanding thereunder and the termination of the commitments thereunder if repayment of more than 50 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility were accelerated and such acceleration were not rescinded or such indebtedness were not satisfied in either case within 30 days an event of default would result under the indenture governing our senior notes entitling the trustee for the notes or holders of at least 25 percent in principal amount of the relevant series of notes then outstanding to declare all such notes to be due and payable immediately if purchase offers were required under the indenture for our notes repayment of the borrowings under our revolving credit facility were required or if our senior notes were accelerated we can give no assurance that we would have sufficient funds to pay the required amounts 

homebuilding and financial services are very competitive industries and competitive conditions could adversely affect our business or financial results 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive homebuilders compete not only for homebuyers but also for desirable properties financing raw materials and skilled labor we compete with local regional and national homebuilders and also with existing home sales foreclosures and rental properties the competitive conditions in the homebuilding industry can negatively affect our sales volumes selling prices and incentive levels reduce our profit margins and cause the value of our inventory or other assets to be impaired competition can also affect our ability to acquire suitable land raw materials and skilled labor at acceptable prices or terms or cause delays in the construction of our homes 

the competitors to our financial services businesses include other title companies and mortgage lenders including national regional and local mortgage banks and other financial institutions some of these competitors are subject to fewer governmental regulations and have greater access to capital than we do and some of them may operate with different lending criteria than we do these competitors may offer a broader or more attractive array of financing and other products and services to potential customers than we do 

our homebuilding and financial services businesses compete with other companies across all industries to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced employees managers and executives competition for the services of these individuals increases as business conditions improve in the homebuilding and financial services industries and in the general economy if we are unable to attract and retain key employees managers or executives our business could be adversely affected 

our business could be adversely affected by the loss of key personnel 

we rely on our key personnel to effectively operate and manage our homebuilding and financial services businesses specifically our success depends heavily on the performance of our homebuilding division and region presidents and their management teams our financial services management team our corporate office management teams and our executive officers these key personnel have significant experience and skills in the homebuilding and financial services industries as well as leadership and management abilities that are important to our success we seek to retain our key personnel and to have succession plans in place to address the potential loss of key personnel however if our retention and succession planning efforts are unsuccessful or if we fail to attract suitable replacements the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business 

information technology failures and data security breaches could harm our business 

we use information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational and marketing activities and to maintain our business records these information technology systems are dependent upon global communications providers web browsers thirdparty software and data storage providers and other aspects of the internet infrastructure that have experienced security breaches cyberattacks significant systems failures and service outages in the past a material breach in the security of our information technology systems or other data security controls could include the theft or release of customer employee or company data a data security breach a significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems or a breach of any of our data security controls could disrupt our business operations damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers adversely impact our sales and revenue and require us to incur significant expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve these kinds of issues the release of confidential information as a result of a security breach could also lead to litigation or other proceedings against us by affected individuals or business partners or by regulators and the outcome of such proceedings which could include penalties or fines could have a significant negative impact on our business we may also be required to incur significant costs to protect against damages caused by information technology failures or security breaches in the future we routinely utilize information technology security experts to assist us in our evaluations of the effectiveness of the security of our information technology systems and we regularly enhance our security measures to protect our systems and data however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures consequently we cannot provide assurances that a security breach cyberattack data theft or other significant systems or security failures will not occur in the future and such occurrences could have a material and adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position

in may and july of 2014 we received notices of violation from the united states environmental protection agency related to stormwater compliance at certain of our sites in the southeast this matter could potentially result in monetary sanctions to the company however we do not believe it is reasonably possible that this matter would result in a loss that would have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend 

results of operations — fiscal year 2017  overview 

during fiscal 2017  demand for new homes continued to reflect the stable to moderately improved trends we experienced across most of our operating markets in fiscal 2016 we continue to see varying levels of strength in new home demand and home prices across our markets with demand in each market generally reflecting the relative strength of each market’s economy as measured by job growth household incomes household formations and consumer confidence 

our position as the largest and most geographically diverse homebuilder in the united states provides a strong platform for us to compete for new home sales in recent years we have focused on expanding our product offerings to more consistently include a broad range of homes for entrylevel moveup and luxury buyers across most of our markets our affordable entrylevel homes have experienced very strong demand from homebuyers as the entrylevel segment of the new home market remains underserved with low inventory levels relative to demand since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 we have been introducing affordable homes in communities designed for active adult buyers seeking a lowmaintenance lifestyle we plan to continue to expand our product offerings across more of our operating markets 

we believe our business is well positioned because of our broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings our ample supply of finished lots land and homes our strong balance sheet and liquidity and our experienced personnel across our operating markets we remain focused on growing our revenues and profitability generating positive annual cash flows from operations and managing our product offerings pricing sales pace and inventory levels to optimize the return on our inventory investments 

in fiscal 2017  our number of homes closed and home sales revenues increased   14  and 16  respectively compared to the prior year our pretax income grew to 16 billion  in fiscal 2017  compared to 14 billion  in fiscal 2016  and 11 billion  in fiscal 2015  our pretax operating margin increased to 114  in fiscal 2017  compared to 111  in fiscal 2016  and 104  in fiscal 2015  cash provided by operations was 4351 million  in fiscal 2017  compared to 6180 million  in fiscal 2016  and 7004 million  in fiscal 2015  in fiscal 2017  our homebuilding return on inventory roi improved to 166  compared to 154  in fiscal 2016  and 128  in fiscal 2015  homebuilding roi is calculated as homebuilding pretax income for the year divided by average inventory average inventory in the roi calculation is the sum of ending inventory balances for the trailing five quarters divided by five 

during the year we also made significant progress in increasing our lots controlled under option purchase contracts to 50  of our total lots owned and controlled compared to 45  in the prior year the transaction with forestar group inc forestar which closed subsequent to year end is expected to advance our strategy of increasing our access to highquality optioned land and lot positions  

we believe that housing demand in our individual operating markets is tied closely to each market’s economy therefore we expect that housing market conditions will vary across our markets if the us economy continues to improve we expect to see slow to moderate growth in housing demand concentrated in markets where job growth is occurring the pace and sustainability of new home demand and our future results could be negatively affected by weakening economic conditions decreases in the level of employment and housing demand decreased home affordability significant increases in mortgage interest rates or tightening of mortgage lending standards 

strategy 

our operating strategy focuses on leveraging our financial and competitive position to increase the returns on our inventory investments and generate strong profitability and cash flows while managing risk this strategy includes the following initiatives 

 

we believe our operating strategy which has produced positive results in recent years will allow us to maintain and improve our financial and competitive position and balance sheet strength however we cannot provide any assurances that the initiatives listed above will continue to be successful and we may need to adjust components of our strategy to meet future market conditions 

key results 

key financial results as of and for our fiscal year ended september 30 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  were as follows 

homebuilding 

 

financial services and other 

 

consolidated results 



results of operations — homebuilding 

our operating segments are our 41  homebuilding operating divisions which we aggregate into six  reporting segments these reporting segments which we also refer to as reporting regions have homebuilding operations located in the following states 



the following tables and related discussion set forth key operating and financial data for our homebuilding operations by reporting segment as of and for the fiscal years ended september 30 2017  2016  and 2015  



 





 

 

net sales orders 

2017 versus 2016 

the value of net sales orders increased   16  to 139 billion   46605  homes in 2017  from 120 billion   40814  homes in 2016  with increases in all of our regions the increase in the value of sales orders was due to increased volume and to a lesser extent increased selling prices in some regions 

the number of net sales orders increased   14  and the average price of net sales orders increased   2  to 299100  during 2017  compared to 2016  the increase in net sales orders reflects the continued stable to moderately improved market conditions in most of our markets our phoenix market contributed the most to the higher volume in our southwest region and our carolina markets contributed most to the higher volume in our east region our sales order cancellation rate cancelled sales orders divided by gross sales orders for the period was 22  in fiscal 2017  compared to 23  in 2016  

we believe our business is well positioned to continue to generate increased sales volumes however our future sales volumes will depend on the economic strength of each of our operating markets and our ability to successfully implement our operating strategies 

2016 versus 2015 

the value of net sales orders increased   12  to 120 billion   40814  homes in 2016  from 107 billion   37380  homes in 2015  with increases in all of our regions the increase in the value of sales orders was due to increased volume and to a lesser extent increased selling prices in most regions 

the number of net sales orders increased   9  and the average price of net sales orders increased   2  to 294000  during 2016  compared to 2015  our florida markets contributed most to the higher volume in our southeast region and our las vegas market contributed most to the higher volume in our west region 



sales order backlog 

sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies including mortgage loan approval and buyers selling their existing homes which can result in cancellations a portion of the contracts in backlog will not result in closings due to cancellations 



2017 versus 2016 

revenues from home sales increased   16  to 137 billion   45751  homes closed in 2017  from 118 billion   40309  homes closed in 2016  the increase in home sales revenues reflects the continued stable to moderately improved market conditions in most of our markets 

the number of homes closed in fiscal 2017   increased   14  from 2016  due to increases in all of our regions our phoenix florida and carolina markets contributed the most to higher closing volumes in our southwest southeast and east regions respectively the average selling price of homes closed during fiscal 2017  was 298400  up 2  from the prior year 

2016 versus 2015 

revenues from home sales increased   13  to 118 billion   40309  homes closed in 2016  from 105 billion   36648  homes closed in 2015  

the number of homes closed in fiscal 2016   increased   10  from 2015  due to increases in most of our regions our florida and phoenix markets contributed the most to higher closing volumes in our southeast and southwest regions respectively the decrease in homes closed in our midwest region was primarily due to lower volume in our chicago and denver markets 

homebuilding operating margin analysis 



home sales gross profit 

2017 versus 2016 

gross profit from home sales increased   15  to 27 billion  in 2017  from 24 billion in 2016  and decreased   20 basis points to 200  as a percentage of home sales revenues the 20  basis point decrease  in the home sales gross profit percentage resulted from a decrease of 50  basis points due to an increase  in warranty and construction defect expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues partially offset by an improvement of 30  basis points due to a decrease  in the amortization of capitalized interest and property taxes 

2016 versus 2015 

gross profit from home sales increased   15  to 24 billion  in 2016  from 21 billion  in 2015  and increased   40 basis points to 202  as a percentage of home sales revenues the 40  basis point increase  in the home sales gross profit percentage resulted from improvements of 30  basis points due to the average selling price of our homes closed increasing by more than the average cost and 10  basis points due to a decrease  in the amortization of capitalized interest and property taxes as a percentage of home sales revenues 

we remain focused on managing the pricing incentives and sales pace in each of our communities to optimize the returns on our inventory investments and adjust to local market conditions our gross profit margins have remained relatively stable in recent years and based on current market conditions we expect continued stability however our gross profit margins could fluctuate in future periods 

land sales and other revenues 

land sales and other revenues were 883 million  787 million  and 896 million  in fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively we continually evaluate our land and lot supply and fluctuations in revenues and profitability from land sales occur based on how we manage our inventory levels in various markets we generally purchase land and lots with the intent to build and sell homes on them however some of the land that we purchase includes commercially zoned parcels that we may sell to commercial developers we may also sell residential lots or land parcels to manage our supply or for other strategic reasons as of september 30 2017  we had 104 million  of land held for sale that we expect to sell in the next twelve months 

inventory and land option charges 

at the end of each quarter during fiscal 2017  we reviewed the performance and outlook for all of our communities and land inventories for indicators of potential impairment and performed detailed impairment evaluations and analyses when necessary as of september 30 2017  we performed detailed impairment evaluations of communities and land inventories with a combined carrying value of 1053 million  and recorded impairment charges of 128 million  during the fourth  quarter to reduce the carrying value of impaired communities and land to their estimated fair value total impairment charges during fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  were 232 million  203 million  and 449 million  respectively 

as we manage our inventory investments across our operating markets to optimize returns and cash flows we may modify our pricing and incentives construction and development plans or land sale strategies in individual active communities and land held for development which could result in the affected communities being evaluated for potential impairment also if housing or economic conditions weaken in specific markets in which we operate or if conditions weaken in the broader economy or homebuilding industry we may be required to evaluate additional communities for potential impairment these evaluations could result in additional impairment charges 

during fiscal 2017  we wrote off 170 million  of earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs related to land option contracts that we have terminated or expect to terminate earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs for fiscal 2016  and 2015  were 111 million  and 154 million  respectively 

selling general and administrative sga expense 

sga expense related to homebuilding activities was 12 billion  11 billion  and 10 billion  in fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively increasing   11  in 2017  and 10  in 2016  from the respective prior years as a percentage of homebuilding revenues sga expense decreased   40 basis points to 89  in 2017  and decreased   20  basis points to 93  in 2016  from the respective prior years this improvement in sga expense as a percentage of homebuilding revenues was achieved primarily through leverage of our fixed overhead costs resulting from the increase in homebuilding revenues 

employee compensation and related costs were 8602 million  7487 million  and 6794 million  in fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively compensation costs represented 70  of sga costs in fiscal 2017  and 68  of sga costs in both fiscal 2016  and 2015  these costs increased   15  in 2017  and 10  in 2016  due to increases in the number of employees and the amount of incentive compensation as compared to the respective prior years our homebuilding operations employed 5876  5366 and 4888  employees at september 30 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

we attempt to control our sga costs while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports our operations however we cannot make assurances that we will be able to maintain or improve upon the current sga expense as a percentage of revenues 

interest incurred 

we capitalize interest costs incurred to inventory during active development and construction active inventory capitalized interest is charged to cost of sales as the related inventory is delivered to the buyer interest incurred decreased   15  to 1293 million  in fiscal 2017  and decreased   10  to 1523 million  in fiscal 2016  compared to the respective prior years these decreases were due to decreases in our average debt of 12  and 9  in fiscal 2017  and 2016  respectively and lower average interest rates on outstanding debt during the periods interest charged to cost of sales was 14  18  and 19  of total cost of sales excluding inventory and land option charges in fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

other income 

other income net of other expenses included in our homebuilding operations was 110 million  127 million  and 78 million  in fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively other income in fiscal 2016  included a 45 million  gain from the sale of an investment in debt securities other income consists of interest income rental income and various other types of ancillary income gains expenses and losses not directly associated with sales of homes land and lots the activities that result in this ancillary income or expense are not significant either individually or in the aggregate 

goodwill impairment 

we performed our annual goodwill impairment evaluation in the fourth  quarters of fiscal 2017  and 2016  as a result of the 2017  evaluation no  impairment charges were recorded as a result of the 2016  evaluation a 72 million  impairment charge was recorded to reduce the goodwill in the huntsville operating segment in our southeast reporting region this operating segment had experienced lower levels of profitability than anticipated primarily due to difficult market conditions see note a 

business acquisitions 

in september 2016  we acquired the homebuilding operations of wilson parker homes for 919 million  wilson parker homes operated in atlanta and augusta georgia raleigh north carolina columbia south carolina and phoenix arizona the assets acquired included approximately 380  homes in inventory 490  lots and control of approximately 1850  additional lots through option contracts we also acquired a sales order backlog of 308  homes valued at 741 million  

subsequent to september 30 2017 we acquired 75  of the outstanding shares of forestar for 5583 million  in cash pursuant to the terms of the june 2017 merger agreement forestar is and will continue to be a publiclytraded residential and real estate development company listed on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol “for” with operations currently in 14  markets and 10  states where it owns directly or through joint ventures interests in 44  residential and mixeduse projects our alignment with forestar advances our strategy of increasing our access to highquality optioned land and lot positions to enhance operational efficiency and returns both companies are identifying land development opportunities to expand forestar’s platform and we plan to acquire a large portion of forestar’s finished lots in accordance with the master supply agreement between the two companies as the controlling shareholder of forestar we will have significant influence in guiding the strategic direction and driving the growth and operational execution necessary to increase the future value potential of forestar

results of operations — financial services and other 

the following tables and related discussion set forth key operating and financial data for our financial services and other operations comprising dhi mortgage our subsidiary title companies and other businesses for the fiscal years ended september 30 2017  2016  and 2015  





financial services and other operating margin analysis 



 



mortgage loan activity 

the volume of loans originated by our mortgage operations is directly related to the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations in fiscal 2017  and 2016  the volume of firstlien loans originated or brokered by dhi mortgage for our homebuyers increased   16  and 17  from the respective prior years primarily as a result of increases  in the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations of 14  and 10  respectively the percentages of total home closings by our homebuilding operations for which dhi mortgage handled the homebuyers’ financing were 56  55  and 51  in fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively these increases also contributed to our higher loan volumes 

home closings from our homebuilding operations constituted 95  93  and 89  of dhi mortgage loan originations in fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively these rates reflect dhi mortgage’s consistent focus on the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations 

the number of loans sold increased   14  in fiscal 2017  and 16  in fiscal 2016  compared to the respective prior years virtually all of the mortgage loans held for sale on september 30 2017  were eligible for sale to fannie mae freddie mac or ginnie mae approximately 84  of the mortgage loans sold by dhi mortgage during fiscal 2017  were sold to three  major financial entities one of which purchased 45  of the total loans sold 

financial services and other revenues and expenses 

revenues from our financial services and other operations increased   18  to 3495 million  in fiscal 2017  from 2956 million  in fiscal 2016  while the number of loan originations increased   13  over that same period revenues from our financial services and other operations increased 12  to 2956 million  in fiscal 2016  from 2650 million  in fiscal 2015  and the number of loan originations also increased 12  in fiscal 2017  revenues increased at a higher rate than origination volume primarily due to improved loan sale execution in the secondary market and increased revenue from title operations 

our mortgage operations revenues were reduced by 29 million  and 85 million  in fiscal 2017  and 2016  respectively to increase our loss reserves for estimated future recourse obligations and other mortgage loans and to adjust certain mortgage loans held for sale to fair value our mortgage operations revenues were increased by 98 million  in fiscal 2015  due to reductions in our loss reserves our loss reserves for loan recourse obligations are estimated based upon analysis of the volume of mortgages originated loan repurchase requests received actual repurchases and losses through the disposition of such loans or requests and discussions with our mortgage purchasers actual losses on mortgage loans may differ from our estimates which may result in future changes to our loss reserves 

general and administrative ga expense related to financial services and other operations was 2512 million  2200 million  and 1830 million  in fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively increasing   14  in 2017  and 20  in 2016  from the respective prior years these increases were primarily due to increases in employee related costs due to both increased volume and the cost of compliance with mortgage industry regulations our financial services and other operations employed 1859  1610  and 1342  employees at september 30 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

as a percentage of financial services and other revenues excluding the effects of recourse expense or benefit ga expense was 713  723  and 717  in fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively fluctuations in financial services ga expense as a percentage of revenues can be expected to occur as some components of revenue may fluctuate differently than loan volumes and some expenses are not directly related to mortgage loan volume or to changes in the amount of revenue earned 

interest and other income net of other expense included in our financial services and other operations consists primarily of the interest income of our mortgage subsidiary 

results of operations — consolidated 

income before income taxes 

pretax income was 16 billion  14 billion  and 11 billion  in fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively the increase in our operating income over the threeyear period is primarily due to higher revenues from increased home closings 

income taxes 

our income tax expense was 5637 million  4672 million  and 3727 million  in fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively and our effective tax rate was 352  345  and 332  respectively in those years the effective tax rate for all years includes an expense for state income taxes reduced by tax benefits for the domestic production activities deduction and federal energy tax credits the effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 also includes a tax benefit for a reduction in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 

we previously filed three requests for advance consent for a change in tax accounting method with the internal revenue service irs relating to changes in the timing of income and expense recognition for tax purposes we agreed to and signed consent agreements for two of the three requests during the quarter ended june 30 2017 the impact of the approved tax accounting method changes was reflected in our consolidated financial statements as of june 30 2017 as a reduction in income taxes payable of 582 million  a reduction in the deferred tax asset related to inventory costs of 501 million  an increase in the deferred tax liability related to the deferral of profit on home sales of 134 million  and income tax expense of 53 million  the third request for advance consent for a change in tax accounting method will be recognized in the period in which a consent agreement is issued by the irs and agreed to and signed by us 

at september 30 2017  and 2016  we had deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities of 3762 million  and 4866 million  respectively partially offset by valuation allowances of 112 million  and 103 million  respectively we had tax benefits of 262 million  that exist for state net operating loss nol carryforwards that will expire at various times depending on the tax jurisdiction of the total amount 38 million  of the tax benefits will expire from fiscal years 2018 to 2022 27 million  will expire from fiscal years 2023 to 2027 and 197 million  will expire from fiscal years 2028 to 2036 we also had tax benefits for state tax credit carryforwards of 14 million  that will expire from fiscal years 2018 to 2019 and 11 million  of tax benefits for state tax credit carryforwards that have no expiration date the accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future results could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position also changes in existing federal and state tax laws and tax rates could affect future tax results and the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities 

when assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income in future periods we record a valuation allowance when we determine it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the valuation allowance for both years relates to our state deferred tax assets for nol carryforwards as of september 30 2017  we believe it is more likely than not that a portion of our state nol carryforwards will not be realized because some state nol carryforward periods are too brief to realize the related deferred tax assets we will continue to evaluate both the positive and negative evidence in determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to our remaining state nol carryforwards 

unrecognized tax benefits are the differences between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefits recognized for accounting purposes we had no  unrecognized tax benefits and no  accrued interest or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits at september 30 2017  and 2016  

we are subject to federal income tax and to income tax in multiple states the statute of limitations for our major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for fiscal years 2014 through 2017 we are currently being audited by various states however to date we are not aware of any significant findings identified by the taxing authorities 

capital resources and liquidity 

we have historically funded our homebuilding and financial services and other operations with cash flows from operating activities borrowings under bank credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities our current levels of cash borrowing capacity and balance sheet leverage provide us with the operational flexibility to adjust to changes in homebuilding market conditions and allow us to increase our investments in homes finished lots land and land development to expand our operations and grow our profitability 

at september 30 2017  our ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital homebuilding notes payable divided by total equity plus homebuilding notes payable was 240  compared to 292  at september 30 2016  over the long term we intend to maintain our ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital below 35  and we expect it to remain significantly lower than 35  throughout fiscal 2018  we believe that the ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital is useful in understanding the leverage employed in our homebuilding operations and comparing our capital structure with other homebuilders we exclude the debt of our financial services business because it is separately capitalized and its obligation under its repurchase facility is substantially collateralized and not guaranteed by our parent company or any of our homebuilding entities 

we regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund growth in our business repay debt obligations and support other general corporate and operational needs and we regularly evaluate our opportunities to raise additional capital we have an automatically effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec in august 2015 registering debt and equity securities that we may issue from time to time in amounts to be determined as market conditions permit we may issue new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets or obtain additional bank financing to fund our projected capital requirements or provide additional liquidity in october 2017  we used cash on hand to purchase 75  of the outstanding shares of forestar for 5583 million  we believe that our existing cash resources our revolving credit facility our mortgage repurchase facility and our ability to access the capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our working capital needs and debt obligations including the maturity of 400 million  principal amount of senior notes in fiscal 2018

mortgage repurchase facility  — our mortgage subsidiary dhi mortgage has a mortgage repurchase facility that is accounted for as a secured financing the mortgage repurchase facility provides financing and liquidity to dhi mortgage by facilitating purchase transactions in which dhi mortgage transfers eligible loans to the counterparties against the transfer of funds by the counterparties thereby becoming purchased loans dhi mortgage then has the right and obligation to repurchase the purchased loans upon their sale to thirdparty purchasers in the secondary market or within specified time frames from 45  to 60 days  in accordance with the terms of the mortgage repurchase facility in february 2017 the mortgage repurchase facility was amended to increase its capacity to 600 million  and extend its maturity date to february 23 2018  the capacity of the facility increases without requiring additional commitments to 725 million  for approximately 30 days at each quarter end and to 800 million  for approximately 45 days at fiscal year end the capacity can also be increased to 10 billion  subject to the availability of additional commitments 

as of september 30 2017  5401 million  of mortgage loans held for sale with a collateral value of 5200 million  were pledged under the mortgage repurchase facility as a result of advance paydowns totaling 1000 million  dhi mortgage had an obligation of 4200 million  outstanding under the mortgage repurchase facility at september 30 2017  at a 33  annual interest rate 

the mortgage repurchase facility is not guaranteed by dr horton inc or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt the facility contains financial covenants as to the mortgage subsidiary’s minimum required tangible net worth its maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and its minimum required liquidity these covenants are measured and reported to the lenders monthly at september 30 2017  dhi mortgage was in compliance with all of the conditions and covenants of the mortgage repurchase facility 

in the past our mortgage subsidiary has been able to renew or extend its mortgage credit facility at a sufficient capacity and on satisfactory terms prior to its maturity and obtain temporary additional commitments through amendments to the credit facility during periods of higher than normal volumes of mortgages held for sale the liquidity of our financial services business depends upon its continued ability to renew and extend the mortgage repurchase facility or to obtain other additional financing in sufficient capacities 

operating cash flow activities 

in fiscal 2017  net cash provided by operating activities was 4351 million  compared to 6180 million  in fiscal 2016  we used 5844 million  of cash to increase our construction in progress and finished home inventory compared to 4962 million  in fiscal 2016  in both years the expenditures were made to support the current year increase in sales and closing volumes as well as the expected increase in the subsequent year cash used to increase residential land and lots inventory to fund future growth was 3623 million  in fiscal 2017  compared to 103 million  in fiscal 2016  the most significant source of cash provided by operating activities in both years was net income

financing cash flow activities 

we expect the shortterm financing needs of our operations will be funded with existing cash cash generated from operations and borrowings under our homebuilding and financial services credit facilities longterm financing needs for the growth of our operations have historically been funded with the issuance of senior unsecured debt securities through the public capital markets 

in fiscal 2017  net cash used in financing activities was 5595 million  consisting primarily of note repayments payments of cash dividends and repurchases of common stock partially offset by note proceeds note repayments of 12 billion  included the repayment of 350 million  principal amount of our 475  senior notes at maturity and repayments of amounts drawn on the revolving credit facility and the mortgage repurchase facility of 8350 million  and 530 million  respectively proceeds from notes payable included draws of 8350 million  on the revolving credit facility during fiscal 2017  we also used cash to repurchase 1850000  shares of our common stock for 606 million  during fiscal 2016  net cash used in financing activities was 5860 million  consisting primarily of note repayments and payments of cash dividends note repayments of 5497 million  included the repayment of 1702 million  principal amount of our 5625 senior notes and 3727 million  principal amount of our 65 senior notes at maturity

contractual cash obligations commercial commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

our primary contractual cash obligations are payments under our debt agreements and lease payments under operating leases we expect to fund our contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business through a combination of our existing cash resources cash flows generated from profits our homebuilding and financial services credit facilities or other bank financing and the issuance of new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets as market conditions may permit 

our future cash requirements for contractual obligations as of september 30 2017  are presented below 



 

 

at september 30 2017  our homebuilding operations had outstanding letters of credit of 968 million  and surety bonds of 12 billion  issued by third parties to secure performance under various contracts we expect that our performance obligations secured by these letters of credit and bonds will generally be completed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms when we complete our performance obligations the related letters of credit and bonds are generally released shortly thereafter leaving us with no continuing obligations we have no material thirdparty guarantees 

our mortgage subsidiary enters into various commitments related to the lending activities of our mortgage operations further discussion of these commitments is provided in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” under part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

seasonality 

although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again in the future we generally close more homes and generate greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year the seasonal nature of our business can also cause significant variations in our working capital requirements in both our homebuilding and financial services operations as a result of seasonal activity our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year 

inflation 

we may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation primarily because of higher financing land labor and material construction costs we attempt to pass cost increases through to our customers through increased sales prices however during periods when housing market conditions are challenging we may not be able to offset cost increases with higher selling prices in addition higher mortgage interest rates reduce the affordability of our homes to prospective homebuyers

we include proceeds from home closings held for our benefit at title companies in homebuilding cash when we execute sales contracts with our homebuyers or when we require advance payment from homebuyers for custom changes upgrades or options related to their homes we record the cash deposits received as liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are cancelled we either retain or refund to the homebuyer deposits on cancelled sales contracts depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances 

we recognize financial services revenues associated with our title operations as closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued both of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed we transfer substantially all underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies to thirdparty insurers we typically elect the fair value option for our mortgage loan originations mortgage loans held for sale are initially recorded at fair value based on either sale commitments or current market quotes and are adjusted for subsequent changes in fair value until the loans are sold net origination costs and fees associated with mortgage loans are recognized at the time of origination the expected net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of a loan are included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings at the time of commitment we generally sell the mortgages we originate and the related servicing rights to thirdparty purchasers within 30 days of origination interest income is earned from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold 

some mortgage loans are sold with limited recourse provisions which can result in repurchases of loans previously sold to investors or payments to reimburse investors for loan losses based on historical experience discussions with our mortgage purchasers analysis of the mortgages we originated and current housing and credit market conditions we estimate and record a loss reserve for mortgage loans held in portfolio and mortgage loans held for sale as well as known and projected mortgage loan repurchase requests 

inventories and cost of sales  — inventory includes the costs of direct land acquisition land development and home construction capitalized interest real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and home construction costs that we incur after development projects or homes are substantially complete such as utilities maintenance and cleaning are charged to sga expense as incurred all indirect overhead costs such as compensation of sales personnel division and region management and the costs of advertising and builder’s risk insurance are charged to sga expense as incurred 

land and development costs are typically allocated to individual residential lots on a prorata basis and the costs of residential lots are transferred to construction in progress when home construction begins home construction costs are specifically identified and recorded to individual homes cost of sales for homes closed includes the specific construction costs of each home and all applicable land acquisition land development and related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred allocated to each residential lot based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each community any changes to the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial home closings in a community are generally allocated on a prorata basis to the remaining homes in the community associated with the relevant development activity 

when a home is closed we generally have not paid all incurred costs necessary to complete the home we record a liability and a charge to cost of sales for the amount estimated to ultimately be paid related to completed homes that have been closed we compare our home construction budgets to actual recorded costs to determine the additional costs remaining to be paid on each closed home we monitor the accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on closed homes in subsequent months to the amounts previously accrued although actual costs to be paid in the future on previously closed homes could differ from our current accruals such differences have not been significant 

each quarter we review our communities and land inventories for indicators of potential impairment we generally review our inventory for impairment indicators at the community level and the inventory within each community is categorized as land held for development residential land and lots developed and under development land held for sale and construction in progress and finished homes based on the stage of production or plans for future development or sale a particular community often includes inventory in more than one category in certain situations inventory may be analyzed separately for impairment purposes based on its product type or future plans in reviewing each of our communities we determine if impairment indicators exist on inventory held and used by analyzing a variety of factors including but not limited to the following 

 

if indicators of impairment are present for a community we perform an impairment evaluation of the community which includes an analysis to determine if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts if so impairment charges are recorded to cost of sales if the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying amounts these estimates of cash flows are significantly impacted by community specific factors including estimates of the amounts and timing of future revenues and estimates of the amount of land development materials and labor costs which in turn may be impacted by the following local market conditions 

 

for those assets deemed to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets our determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams when an impairment charge for a community is determined the charge is then allocated to each lot in the community in the same manner as land and development costs are allocated to each lot impairment charges are also recorded on finished homes in substantially completed communities when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values are greater than the fair values less estimated costs to sell these homes 

for the inventory impairment analyses performed during fiscal 2017  we assumed that for the majority of communities sales prices in future periods will be equal to or lower than current sales order prices in each community or in comparable communities in order to generate an acceptable absorption rate the remaining lives of the communities evaluated were estimated to be in a range from six months  to two years  and we utilized a range of discount rates for communities from 12  to 18  

we rarely purchase land for resale however when we own land or communities under development that do not fit into our development and construction plans and we determine that we will sell the asset the project is accounted for as land held for sale if certain criteria are met we record land held for sale at the lesser of its carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell in performing the impairment evaluation for land held for sale we consider several factors including but not limited to recent offers received to purchase the property prices for land in recent comparable sales transactions and market analysis studies which include the estimated price a willing buyer would pay for the land if the estimated fair value less costs to sell an asset is less than the current carrying value the asset is written down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell 

the key assumptions relating to inventory valuations are impacted by local market and economic conditions and are inherently uncertain although our quarterly assessments reflect management’s best estimates due to uncertainties in the estimation process actual results could differ from such estimates 

business acquisitions  — we account for acquisitions of businesses by allocating the purchase price of the business to the various assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired particularly intangible assets these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and our estimates of significant assumptions that a market participant would use when determining fair value while we believe the estimates and assumptions are reasonable they are inherently uncertain unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions 

goodwill  — we record goodwill associated with our acquisitions of businesses when the purchase price of the business exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired we evaluate our goodwill balances for potential impairment on at least an annual basis by comparing the carrying value of each of our operating segments with goodwill to their estimated fair values the estimated fair value is determined by discounting the future cash flows of the operating segment to their present value if the carrying value of the operating segment exceeds its fair value we determine if an impairment exists based on the implied fair value of the operating segment’s goodwill as a result of the goodwill evaluation performed in fiscal 2017  no  impairment charges were recorded as a result of the goodwill evaluation performed in fiscal 2016  an impairment charge of 72 million  was recorded to write off the remaining goodwill associated with the huntsville operating segment in the southeast reporting region this operating segment experienced lower levels of profitability than anticipated primarily due to difficult market conditions our total goodwill balance was 800 million  at both september 30 2017  and 2016  

warranty claims  — we typically provide our homebuyers with a tenyear limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems a twoyear limited warranty on major mechanical systems and a oneyear limited warranty on other construction components since we subcontract our construction work to subcontractors who typically provide us with an indemnity and a certificate of insurance prior to receiving payments for their work claims relating to workmanship and materials are generally the primary responsibility of the subcontractors warranty liabilities have been established by charging cost of sales for each home delivered the amounts charged are based on management’s estimate of expected warrantyrelated costs under all unexpired warranty obligation periods our warranty liability is based upon historical warranty cost experience in each market in which we operate and is adjusted to reflect qualitative risks associated with the types of homes we build and the geographic areas in which we build them actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts a 10 change in the historical warranty rates used to estimate our warranty accrual would not result in a material change in our accrual 

legal claims and insurance  — we are named as a defendant in various claims complaints and other legal actions in the ordinary course of business at any point in time we are managing several hundred individual claims related to construction defect matters personal injury claims employment matters land development issues contract disputes and other matters we have established reserves for these contingencies based on the estimated costs of pending claims and the estimated costs of anticipated future claims related to previously closed homes approximately 98  and 95  of these reserves related to construction defect matters at september 30 2017  and 2016  respectively 

our reserves for construction defect claims include the estimated costs of both known claims and anticipated future claims at both september 30 2017  and 2016  we had reserves for approximately 140  pending construction defect claims and no individual existing claim was material to our financial statements during fiscal 2017  we established reserves for approximately 75  new construction defect claims and resolved 75  construction defect claims for a total cost of 526 million  we have closed a significant number of homes during recent years and we may be subject to future construction defect claims on these homes although regulations vary from state to state construction defect issues can generally be reported for up to ten years after the home has closed in many states in which we operate historical data and trends regarding the frequency of claims incurred and the costs to resolve claims relative to the types of products and markets where we operate are used to estimate the construction defect liabilities for both existing and anticipated future claims these estimates are subject to ongoing revision as the circumstances of individual pending claims and historical data and trends change adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the accounting period in which the change in estimate occurs 

historical trends in construction defect claims have been inconsistent and we believe they may continue to fluctuate housing market conditions have been volatile across most of our markets over the past ten years and we believe such conditions can affect the frequency and cost of construction defect claims we closed a significant number of homes over the past ten years if the ultimate resolution of construction defect claims resulting from our home closings in prior years varies from current expectations it could significantly change our estimates regarding the frequency and timing of claims incurred and the costs to resolve existing and anticipated future claims which would impact the construction defect reserves in the future if the frequency of claims incurred or costs of existing and future legal claims significantly exceed our current estimates they will have a significant negative impact on our future earnings and liquidity 

we estimate and record receivables under the applicable insurance policies related to our estimated contingencies for known claims and anticipated future construction defect claims on previously closed homes and other legal claims and lawsuits incurred in the ordinary course of business when recovery is probable additionally we may have the ability to recover a portion of our losses from our subcontractors and their insurance carriers when we have been named as an additional insured on their insurance policies 

the estimation of losses related to these reserves and the related estimates of recoveries from insurance policies are subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends in construction defect claims relative to our markets and the types of products built claim frequency claim settlement costs and patterns insurance industry practices and legal interpretations among others due to the high degree of judgment required in establishing reserves for these contingencies actual future costs and recoveries from insurance could differ significantly from current estimated amounts a 10 increase in the claim frequency and the average cost per claim used to estimate the reserves would result in an increase of approximately 714 million  in our reserves and a 361 million  increase in our receivable resulting in additional expense of 353 million  a 10 decrease in the claim frequency and the average cost per claim would result in a decrease of approximately 639 million  in our reserves and a 286 million  decrease in our receivable resulting in a reduction in expense of 353 million  

income taxes  — we calculate our income tax expense benefit using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and attributable to net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards when assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income in future periods and in the jurisdictions in which those temporary differences become deductible we record a valuation allowance when we determine it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized the accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future results could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position also changes in existing federal and state tax laws and tax rates could affect future tax results and the valuation of our deferred tax assets 

interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in the financial statements as a component of income tax expense significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions we evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis our evaluations are based upon a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change 

stockbased compensation  — our stockholders formally authorize shares of our common stock to be available for future grants of stockbased compensation awards from time to time the compensation committee of our board of directors authorizes the grant of stockbased compensation to our employees and directors from these available shares at september 30 2017  our outstanding stockbased compensation awards include stock options and restricted stock units grants of restricted stock units may vest immediately or over a certain number of years as determined by the compensation committee of our board of directors restricted stock units outstanding at september 30 2017  have a remaining vesting period of 1  to 5 years  stock options are granted at exercise prices which equal the market value of our common stock at the date of the grant the stock options outstanding at september 30 2017  vest over periods of 2  to 975 years from the initial grant date and expire 10 years  after the dates on which they were granted 

the compensation expense for stockbased awards is based on the fair value of the award and is recognized on a straightline basis over the remaining vesting period the fair values of restricted stock units are based on our stock price at the date of grant the fair values of stock options granted are calculated on the date of grant using a blackscholes option pricing model determining the fair value of stock options requires judgment in developing assumptions and involves a number of estimates these estimates include but are not limited to the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards the expected dividend yield and expected stock option exercise behavior in addition we also use judgment in estimating the number of stock options that are expected to be forfeited the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense are reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows as a financing cash flow 

fair value measurements  — the financial accounting standards board’s fasb authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes a threelevel hierarchy based upon the inputs to the valuation model of an asset or liability the fair value hierarchy and its application to our assets and liabilities is as follows 

 

when available we use quoted market prices in active markets to determine fair value we consider the principal market and nonperformance risk associated with our counterparties when determining the fair value measurements if applicable fair value measurements are used for our mortgage loans held for sale debt securities collateralized by residential real estate interest rate lock commitments irlcs and other derivative instruments on a recurring basis and are used for inventories certain other mortgage loans rental properties and real estate owned on a nonrecurring basis when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers” which is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance the core principle of this guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2018 and allows for full retrospective or modified retrospective methods of adoption we currently plan to adopt this standard using the modified retrospective method and are continuing to evaluate its effect 

in july 2015 the fasb issued asu 201511 “simplifying the measurement of inventory” which simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventory excluding inventory measured using the lastin firstout or retail inventory methods the guidance specifies that inventory currently measured at the lower of cost or market where market could be determined with different methods should now be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2017 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in january 2016 the fasb issued asu 201601 “financial instruments  recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities” which addresses certain aspects of recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instruments the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2018 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

in june 2016 the fasb issued asu 201613 “financial instruments  credit losses” which replaces the current incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information in determining credit loss estimates the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2020 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in august 2016 the fasb issued asu 201615 “statement of cash flows  classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments” which amends and clarifies the current guidance to reduce diversity in practice of the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2018 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated statements of cash flows 

in november 2016 the fasb issued asu 201618 “statement of cash flows  restricted cash” which requires amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the total beginning and ending amounts for the periods shown on the statement of cash flows the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2018 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or cash flows

in january 2017 the fasb issued asu 201704 “intangibles  goodwill and other” the guidance simplifies the measurement of goodwill impairment by removing the second step of the goodwill impairment test which requires the determination of the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit under the new guidance goodwill impairment is measured as the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value with the loss recognized limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2020 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in may 2017 the fasb issued asu 201709 “compensation  stock compensation scope of modification accounting” which clarifies which changes to the terms or conditions of a sharebased payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting under the new guidance modification accounting is required if the fair value vesting conditions or classification equity or liability of the new award are different from the original award immediately before the original award is modified the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2018 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

we are subject to interest rate risk on our longterm debt we monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and utilize both fixed and variable rate debt for fixed rate debt changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows conversely for variable rate debt changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument but may affect our future earnings and cash flows except in very limited circumstances we do not have an obligation to prepay fixedrate debt prior to maturity and as a result interest rate risk and changes in fair value would not have a significant impact on our cash flows related to our fixedrate debt until such time as we are required to refinance repurchase or repay such debt 

we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with our mortgage loan origination services we manage interest rate risk through the use of forward sales of mortgagebacked securities mbs which are referred to as “hedging instruments” in the following discussion we do not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate lock commitments irlcs are extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and who meet defined credit and underwriting criteria typically the irlcs have a duration of less than six months some irlcs are committed immediately to a specific purchaser through the use of bestefforts whole loan delivery commitments while other irlcs are funded prior to being committed to thirdparty purchasers the hedging instruments related to irlcs are classified and accounted for as derivative instruments in an economic hedge with gains and losses recognized in financial services revenues in the consolidated statements of operations hedging instruments related to funded uncommitted loans are accounted for at fair value with changes recognized in financial services revenues in the consolidated statements of operations along with changes in the fair value of the funded uncommitted loans the fair value change related to the hedging instruments generally offsets the fair value change in the uncommitted loans the net fair value change which for the years ended september 30 2017  and 2016  was not significant is recognized in current earnings at september 30 2017  hedging instruments used to mitigate interest rate risk related to uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale and uncommitted irlcs totaled a notional amount of 7200 million  uncommitted irlcs totaled a notional amount of approximately 4193 million  and uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale totaled a notional amount of approximately 3307 million  at september 30 2017  

the following table sets forth principal cash flows by scheduled maturity effective weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value of our debt obligations as of september 30 2017  because the mortgage repurchase facility is effectively secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale which are typically sold within 60 days its outstanding balance is included in the most current period presented the interest rate for our variable rate debt represents the weighted average interest rate in effect at september 30 2017

operating structure and processes 

following is an overview of our company’s operating structure and the significant processes that support our business controls strategies and performance 

homebuilding markets 

our homebuilding business began in the dallasfort worth area which is still one of our largest homebuilding operations and home to our corporate headquarters we currently operate in 26 states and 78  markets which provides us with geographic diversification in our homebuilding inventory investments and our sources of revenues and earnings we believe our geographic diversification lowers our operational risks by mitigating the effects of local and regional economic cycles and it also enhances our earnings potential by providing more diverse opportunities to invest in our business 

we conduct our homebuilding operations in the geographic regions states and markets listed below and we conduct our mortgage and title operations in many of these markets our homebuilding operating divisions are aggregated into six  reporting segments also referred to as reporting regions which comprise the markets below our financial statements contain additional information regarding segment performance 



when evaluating new or existing homebuilding markets for purposes of capital allocation we consider local marketspecific factors including among others 

 

economies of scale 

we are the largest homebuilding company in the united states in fiscal 2016  as measured by number of homes closed and revenues and we are also one of the largest builders in many of the markets in which we operate we believe that our national regional and local scale of operations provides us with benefits that may not be available to the same degree to some other smaller homebuilders such as 

 

decentralized homebuilding operations 

we view homebuilding as a local business therefore most of our direct homebuilding activities are decentralized to provide flexibility to our local managers on operational decisions we believe that our local management teams who are familiar with local conditions have the best information on which to base many decisions regarding their operations at september 30 2016  we had 39  separate homebuilding operating divisions many of which operate in more than one market area generally each operating division consists of a division president a controller land entitlement acquisition and development personnel a sales manager and sales and marketing personnel a construction manager and construction superintendents customer service personnel a purchasing manager and office staff our division presidents receive performance based compensation if they achieve targeted financial and operating metrics related to their operating divisions following is a summary of our homebuilding activities that are decentralized in our local operating divisions and the control and oversight functions that are centralized in our regional and corporate offices 

operating division responsibilities 

each operating division is responsible for 

 — a feasibility study 

— soil and environmental reviews 

— review of existing zoning and other governmental requirements 

— review of the need for and extent of offsite work required to obtain project entitlements and 

— financial analysis of the potential project 

 

centralized controls 

we centralize many important risk elements of our homebuilding business through our regional and corporate offices we have five separate homebuilding regional offices generally each regional office consists of a region president legal counsel a chief financial officer and limited office support staff each of our region presidents and their management teams are responsible for oversight of the operations of a number of homebuilding operating divisions including 

 

our corporate executives and corporate office departments are responsible for establishing our operational policies and internal control standards and for monitoring compliance with established policies and controls throughout our operations the corporate office also has primary responsibility for direct management of certain key risk elements and initiatives through the following centralized functions 

 

landlot acquisition and inventory management 

we acquire land for use in our homebuilding operations after we have completed due diligence and generally after we have obtained the rights known as entitlements to begin development or construction work resulting in an acceptable number of residential lots before we acquire lots or tracts of land we complete a feasibility study which includes soil tests independent environmental studies other engineering work and financial analysis we also evaluate the status of necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements required to develop and use the property for home construction although we purchase and develop land primarily to support our homebuilding activities we may sell land and lots to other developers and homebuilders where we have excess land and lot positions 

we also enter into landlot option contracts in which we obtain the right but generally not the obligation to buy land or lots at predetermined prices on a defined schedule commensurate with anticipated home closings or planned development our option contracts generally are nonrecourse which limits our financial exposure to our earnest money deposited into escrow under the terms of the contract and any preacquisition due diligence costs we incur this enables us to control land and lot positions with limited capital investment which substantially reduces the risks associated with land ownership and development 

we directly acquire almost all of our land and lot positions we are a party to a small number of joint ventures all of which are consolidated in our financial statements 

we attempt to mitigate our exposure to real estate inventory risks by 

 

land development and home construction 

substantially all of our land development and home construction work is performed by subcontractors subcontractors typically are selected after a competitive bidding process and are retained for a specific subdivision or series of house plans pursuant to a contract that obligates the subcontractor to complete the scope of work at an agreedupon price we employ land development managers and construction superintendents to monitor land development and home construction activities participate in major design and building decisions coordinate the activities of subcontractors and suppliers review the work of subcontractors for quality and cost controls and monitor compliance with zoning and building codes in addition our construction superintendents interact with our homebuyers during the construction process and instruct buyers on postclosing home maintenance 

our home designs are selected or prepared in each of our markets to appeal to the preferences of local homebuyers in each community our local management teams regularly adjust our product offerings to address our customers’ expectations for affordability home size and features in most communities we offer optional interior and exterior features to homebuyers for an additional charge construction time for our homes depends on the availability of labor materials and supplies the weather the size of the home and other factors we complete the construction of most homes within three  to six months  

we typically do not maintain significant inventories of land development or construction materials except for work in progress materials for active development projects and homes under construction generally the construction materials used in our operations are readily available from numerous sources we have contracts exceeding one year with certain suppliers of building materials that are cancelable at our option 

we are subject to governmental regulations that affect our land development and construction operations at times we have experienced delays in receiving the proper approvals from municipalities or other government agencies that have delayed our anticipated development and construction activities in individual communities 

cost controls 

we control construction costs by designing our homes efficiently and by obtaining competitive bids for construction materials and labor we also competitively bid and negotiate pricing from our subcontractors and suppliers based on the volume of services and products we purchase on a local regional and national basis we monitor our land development expenditures and construction costs versus budgets for each house and community and we review our inventory levels margins expenses profitability and returns for each operating market compared to both its business plan and our performance expectations 

we control overhead costs by centralizing certain accounting and administrative functions and by monitoring staffing and compensation levels we review other general and administrative costs to identify efficiencies and savings opportunities in our operating divisions and our regional and corporate offices we also direct many of our promotional activities toward local real estate brokers and digital marketing initiatives which we believe are an efficient use of our marketing expenditures 

marketing and sales 

in most of our markets we use the dr horton emerald homes and express homes brand names to market and sell our homes our dr horton branded communities are the core of our business and account for the majority of our home closings focusing on the first time and first time moveup homebuyer our emerald branded communities appeal to buyers in search of higherend moveup and luxury homes our express branded communities primarily accommodate a segment of entrylevel buyers who are focused on affordability in fiscal 2016  homes marketed under our express homes brand represented 26  of our home closings and 18  of our home sales revenue and homes marketed under our emerald homes brand represented 4  of our home closings and 9  of our home sales revenue 

we also use the pacific ridge homes brand in our seattle market following our acquisition of their homebuilding operations in fiscal 2015 and their product offerings are similar to our dr horton communities we introduced our freedom homes brand in late fiscal 2016 to offer affordable homes specifically for the active adult buyer seeking a lowmaintenance lifestyle in an agerestricted or agetargeted community 

we market and sell our homes primarily through commissioned employees and the majority of our home closings also involve an independent real estate broker we typically conduct home sales from sales offices located in furnished model homes in each subdivision and we generally do not offer our model homes for sale until the completion of a subdivision our sales personnel assist prospective homebuyers by providing floor plans and price information demonstrating the features and layouts of our homes and assisting with the selection of options we train and inform our sales personnel as to the availability of financing construction schedules and marketing and advertising plans as market conditions warrant we may provide potential homebuyers with incentives such as discounts or free upgrades to be competitive in a particular market 

we market our homes and communities to prospective homebuyers and real estate brokers through digital media including email search engine marketing social networking sites and our company website as well as through print media and advertisement we also use billboards radio television magazine and newspaper advertising as necessary in each local market we attempt to position our subdivisions in locations that are desirable to potential homebuyers and convenient to or visible from local traffic patterns which helps to reduce advertising costs model homes play a substantial role in our marketing efforts and we expend significant effort and resources to create an attractive atmosphere in our model homes 

we also build speculative homes in most of our subdivisions these homes enhance our marketing and sales efforts to prospective homebuyers who are renters or who are relocating to these markets and require a home within a short time frame as well as to independent brokers who represent these homebuyers we determine our speculative homes strategy in each market based on local market factors such as new job growth the number of job relocations housing demand and supply seasonality current sales contract cancellation trends and our past experience in the market we maintain a level of speculative home inventory in each subdivision based on our current and planned sales pace and we monitor and adjust speculative home inventory on an ongoing basis as conditions warrant speculative homes allow us to compete effectively with existing homes available in the market and improve our profits and returns 

sales contracts and backlog 

our sales contracts require an earnest money deposit which varies in amount across our markets and subdivisions additionally customers are generally required to pay additional deposits when they select options or upgrade features for their homes our sales contracts include a financing contingency which permits customers to cancel and receive a refund of their deposit if they cannot obtain mortgage financing at prevailing or specified interest rates within a specified period our contracts may include other contingencies such as the sale of an existing home we either retain or refund customer deposits on cancelled sales contracts depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances 

sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period at september 30 2016  the value of our backlog of sales orders was 34 billion   11475  homes an increase  of 9  from 31 billion   10662  homes at september 30 2015  the average sales price of homes in backlog was 299600  at september 30 2016  up   2  from the 295100  average at september 30 2015  many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies such as those described above which can result in cancellations a portion of the contracts in backlog will not result in closings due to cancellations as a percentage of gross sales orders cancellations of sales contracts were 23  in both fiscal 2016  and 2015  

the length of time between the signing of a sales contract for a home and delivery of the home to the buyer closing is generally from two  to six months  therefore substantially all of the homes in our sales backlog at september 30 2016  are scheduled to close in fiscal year 2017  further discussion of our backlog is provided in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

customer service and quality control 

our operating divisions are responsible for preclosing quality control inspections and responding to customers’ postclosing needs we believe that a prompt and courteous response to homebuyers’ needs during and after construction reduces postclosing repair costs enhances our reputation for quality and service and ultimately leads to repeat and referral business from the real estate community and homebuyers we typically provide our homebuyers with a tenyear limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems a twoyear limited warranty on major mechanical systems and a oneyear limited warranty on other construction components the subcontractors who perform the actual construction also provide us with warranties on workmanship and are generally prepared to respond to us and the homeowner promptly upon request in addition some of our suppliers provide manufacturer’s warranties on specified products installed in the home 

customer mortgage financing 

we provide mortgage financing services principally to purchasers of our homes in the majority of our homebuilding markets through dhi mortgage our 100 owned subsidiary dhi mortgage assists in the sales transaction by coordinating the mortgage application mortgage commitment and home closing processes to facilitate a timely and efficient home buying experience for our buyers dhi mortgage originates mortgage loans for a substantial portion of our homebuyers during the year ended september 30 2016  dhi mortgage provided mortgage financing services for approximately 55  of our total homes closed and approximately 93  of dhi mortgage’s loan volume related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations most of our homebuilding divisions also work with a number of additional mortgage lenders that offer a range of mortgage financing programs to our homebuyers 

to limit the risks associated with our mortgage operations dhi mortgage originates loan products that we believe can be sold to thirdparty purchasers of mortgage loans the majority of which are eligible for sale to the federal national mortgage association fannie mae the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac or the government national mortgage association ginnie mae dhi mortgage sells substantially all of the loans and their servicing rights to thirdparty purchasers shortly after origination with limited recourse provisions dhi mortgage centralizes most of its control and oversight functions including those related to loan underwriting quality control regulatory compliance secondary marketing of loans hedging activities accounting and financial reporting 

title services 

through our subsidiary title companies we serve as a title insurance agent in selected markets by providing title insurance policies examination and closing services primarily to our homebuilding customers we currently assume little or no underwriting risk associated with these title policies 

employees 

at september 30 2016  we employed 6976 persons of whom 1588  were sales and marketing personnel 1903  were involved in construction 1910  were office personnel and 1575  worked in mortgage and title operations we focus significant attention toward attracting and retaining talented and experienced individuals to manage and support our operations and we believe that we have good relations with our employees 

recent business acquisitions 

we routinely evaluate opportunities to profitably expand our operations including potential acquisitions of other homebuilding or related businesses in april 2015  we acquired the homebuilding operations of pacific ridge homes which operates in seattle washington in september 2016  we acquired the homebuilding operations of wilson parker homes which operates in atlanta and augusta georgia raleigh north carolina columbia south carolina and phoenix arizona 

acquisitions of homebuilding businesses usually provide us with immediate land and home inventories and control of additional land and lot positions through option contracts also employees of acquired businesses generally have specialized knowledge of local market conditions including existing relationships with municipalities land owners developers subcontractors and suppliers these inventory positions and local market knowledge and relationships could take us several years to develop through our own efforts we seek to limit the risks associated with acquiring other companies by conducting extensive operational financial and legal due diligence on each acquisition and by performing financial analysis to determine that each acquisition will have a positive impact on our earnings within an acceptable period of time 

competition 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous other national regional and local homebuilders for homebuyers desirable land raw materials skilled labor employees management talent and financing we also compete with resales of existing and foreclosed homes and with the rental housing market our homes compete on the basis of quality price location design and mortgage financing terms 

the competitors to our financial services businesses include other title companies and mortgage lenders including national regional and local mortgage bankers and other financial institutions some of these competitors are subject to fewer governmental regulations and may have greater access to capital than we do and some of them may operate with different lending criteria and may offer a broader array of financing and other products and services to consumers than we do 

governmental regulation and environmental matters 

the homebuilding industry is subject to extensive and complex regulations we and the subcontractors we use must comply with many federal state and local laws and regulations these include zoning density and development requirements and building environmental advertising labor and real estate sales rules and regulations these regulations and requirements affect substantially all aspects of our land development and home design construction and sales processes in varying degrees across our markets our homes are inspected by local authorities where required and homes eligible for insurance or guarantees provided by the federal housing administration fha and the department of veteran affairs va are subject to inspection by them these regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities in addition our new housing developments may be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets utilities and other public improvements 

our homebuilding operations are also subject to an extensive array of local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning protection of health safety and the environment the particular environmental laws for each site vary greatly according to location environmental condition and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties 

our mortgage company must comply with extensive state and federal laws and regulations which are administered by numerous agencies including but not limited to the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb federal housing finance agency us department of housing and urban development fha va united states department of agriculture usda fannie mae freddie mac and ginnie mae these laws and regulations include many compliance requirements including but not limited to licensing consumer disclosures fair lending and real estate settlement procedures as a result our operations are subject to regular extensive examinations by the applicable agencies 

seasonality 

although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again in the future we generally close more homes and generate greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year the seasonal nature of our business can also cause significant variations in our working capital requirements in both our homebuilding and financial services operations as a result of seasonal activity our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend 

discussion of our business and operations included in this annual report on form 10k should be read together with the risk factors set forth below they describe various risks and uncertainties we are or may become subject to many of which are difficult to predict or beyond our control these risks and uncertainties together with other factors described elsewhere in this report have the potential to affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner 

the homebuilding industry is cyclical and affected by changes in economic real estate or other conditions that could adversely affect our business or financial results 

the homebuilding industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic and real estate conditions such as 

 

adverse changes in these general and local economic conditions or deterioration in the broader economy would cause a negative impact on our business and financial results and increase the risk for asset impairments and writeoffs changes in these economic conditions may affect some of our regions or markets more than others if adverse conditions affect our larger markets they could have a proportionately greater impact on us than on some other homebuilding companies 

in recent years concerns regarding the us government’s fiscal policies and economic stimulus actions have created uncertainty in the financial markets and caused volatility in interest rates which has impacted business and consumer confidence federal government actions related to economic stimulus taxation and spending levels borrowing limits and new federal legislation along with the related political debates conflicts and compromises associated with such actions may negatively impact the financial markets and consumer spending such events could hurt the us economy and the housing market and in turn could adversely affect the operating results of our homebuilding financial services and other businesses 

weather conditions and natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes volcanic activity droughts and floods heavy or prolonged precipitation or wildfires can harm our homebuilding business these can delay our development work home construction and home closings adversely affect the cost or availability of materials or labor or damage homes under construction the climates and geology of many of the states in which we operate including california florida texas and other coastal areas where we have some of our larger operations present increased risks of adverse weather or natural disasters 

deployments of us military personnel to foreign regions terrorist attacks other acts of violence or threats to national security and any corresponding response by the united states or others related domestic or international instability or civil unrest may cause an economic slowdown in the markets where we operate which could adversely affect our homebuilding business 

public health issues such as a major epidemic or pandemic could adversely affect our business the us and other countries have experienced and may experience in the future outbreaks of contagious diseases that affect public perception of health risk in the event of a widespread prolonged actual or perceived outbreak of a contagious disease our operations could be negatively impacted by a reduction in customer traffic or other factors which could reduce demand for new homes 

if we experience any of the foregoing potential customers may be less willing or able to buy our homes in the future our pricing and product strategies may also be limited by market conditions we may be unable to change the mix of our home offerings reduce the costs of the homes we build offer more affordable homes or satisfactorily address changing market conditions in other ways without adversely affecting our profit margins in addition cancellations of home sales contracts in backlog may increase if homebuyers do not honor their contracts due to any of the factors discussed above 

our financial services business is closely related to our homebuilding business as it originates mortgage loans principally to purchasers of the homes we build a decrease in the demand for our homes because of the foregoing matters will also adversely affect the financial results of this segment of our business an increase in the default rate on the mortgages we originate may adversely affect our ability to sell the mortgages or the pricing we receive upon the sale of mortgages or may increase our recourse obligations for previous originations we may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to thirdparty purchasers in the event of errors or omissions relating to certain representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the type of collateral the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in the connection with the loan we establish reserves related to mortgages we have sold however actual future obligations related to these mortgages could differ significantly from our current estimated amounts 

constriction of the credit markets could limit our ability to access capital and increase our costs of capital 

during economic and housing downturns in prior years the credit markets constricted and reduced some sources of liquidity that were previously available to us consequently we relied principally on our cash on hand to meet our working capital needs and repay outstanding indebtedness during those years there likely will be periods in the future when financial market upheaval will increase our cost of capital or limit our ability to access the public debt markets or obtain bank financing 

we have a 975 million  senior unsecured revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to 125 billion  subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments the facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit equal to approximately 50  of the revolving credit commitment the maturity date of the commitments under the facility is september 7 2020  also our mortgage subsidiary utilizes a mortgage repurchase facility to finance the majority of the loans it originates at september 30 2016  the capacity of the facility was 700 million  and can be increased to 800 million  subject to the availability of additional commitments the mortgage repurchase facility must be renewed annually and currently expires on february 24 2017  we expect to renew and extend the term of the mortgage repurchase facility with similar terms prior to its maturity adverse changes in market conditions could make the renewal of these facilities more difficult or could result in an increase in the cost of these facilities or a decrease in the committed amounts such changes affecting our mortgage repurchase facility may also make it more difficult or costly to sell the mortgages that we originate 

we believe that our existing cash resources our revolving credit facility and our mortgage repurchase facility provide sufficient liquidity to fund our nearterm working capital needs and debt obligations we regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund future growth in our business repay future debt obligations and support other general corporate and operational needs and we regularly evaluate our opportunities to raise additional capital as market conditions permit we may issue new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets or obtain additional bank financing to fund our projected capital requirements or provide additional liquidity adverse changes in economic homebuilding or capital market conditions could negatively affect our business liquidity and financial results restrict our ability to obtain additional capital or increase our costs of capital 

reductions in the availability of mortgage financing provided by government agencies changes in government financing programs a decrease in our ability to sell mortgage loans on attractive terms or an increase in mortgage interest rates could decrease our buyers’ ability to obtain financing and adversely affect our business or financial results 

the mortgage lending industry has experienced significant change over the past decade including volatility in the secondary market and a number of new government regulations since the secondary market continues to primarily desire securities backed by fannie mae freddie mac or ginnie mae we believe the liquidity these agencies provide to the mortgage industry is important to the housing market there have been ongoing discussions by the government with regard to the longterm structure and viability of fannie mae and freddie mac which could result in adjustments to the size of their loan portfolios and to guidelines for their loan products any reduction in the availability of the financing provided by these institutions could adversely affect interest rates mortgage availability and sales of new homes and mortgage loans 

the fha insures mortgage loans that generally have lower credit requirements and is an important source for financing the sale of our homes changes restrictions or premium increases in fha programs in the future may negatively affect the availability or affordability of fha financing which could adversely affect our ability to sell homes 

some of our customers may qualify for 100 financing through programs offered by the va usda and certain housing finance agencies these programs are subject to changes in regulations lending standards and government funding levels there can be no assurances that these programs or other programs will continue to be available in our homebuilding markets or that they will be as attractive to our customers as the programs currently offered which could negatively affect our sales 

the mortgage loans originated by our financial services operations are primarily eligible for sale to fannie mae freddie mac and ginnie mae and are sold to thirdparty purchasers during fiscal 2016  approximately 92  of our mortgage loans were sold to four  financial entities one of which purchased 27  of the total loans sold on an ongoing basis we seek to establish loan purchase arrangements with additional financial entities if we are unable to sell mortgage loans to purchasers on attractive terms our ability to originate and sell mortgage loans at competitive prices could be limited which would negatively affect our profitability 

even if potential customers do not need financing changes in the availability of mortgage products may make it more difficult for them to sell their current homes to potential buyers who need financing 

mortgage rates are currently low as compared to most historical periods when interest rates increase the cost of owning a home will increase which will likely reduce the number of potential homebuyers who can obtain mortgage financing and could result in a decline in the demand for our homes 

the risks associated with our land and lot inventory could adversely affect our business or financial results 

inventory risks are substantial for our homebuilding business there are risks inherent in controlling owning and developing land if housing demand declines we may not be able to build and sell homes profitably in some of our communities and we may not be able to fully recover the costs of some of the land and lots we own also the values of our owned undeveloped land lots and housing inventories may fluctuate significantly due to changes in market conditions as a result our deposits for lots controlled under option or similar contracts may be put at risk we may have to sell homes or land for a lower profit margin or record inventory impairment charges on our land and lots a significant deterioration in economic or homebuilding industry conditions may result in substantial inventory impairment charges 

homebuilding is subject to home warranty and construction defect claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant 

we are subject to home warranty and construction defect claims arising in the ordinary course of our homebuilding business we rely on subcontractors to perform the actual construction of our homes and in many cases to select and obtain construction materials despite our detailed specifications and monitoring of the construction process our subcontractors occasionally do not meet adequate quality standards in the construction of our homes when we find these issues we repair them in accordance with our warranty obligations we spend significant resources to repair items in homes we have sold to fulfill the warranties we issued to our homebuyers additionally we are subject to construction defect claims which can be costly to defend and resolve in the legal system warranty and construction defect matters can also result in negative publicity in the media and on the internet which can damage our reputation and adversely affect our ability to sell homes 

based on the large number of homes we have sold over the years our potential liabilities related to warranty and construction defect claims are significant as a consequence we maintain product liability insurance and we seek to obtain indemnities and certificates of insurance from subcontractors covering claims related to their workmanship and materials we establish warranty and other reserves for the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built because of the uncertainties inherent to these matters we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will be adequate to address all of our future warranty and construction defect claims contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce we may be responsible for applicable selfinsured retentions and some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits additionally the coverage offered by and the availability of product liability insurance for construction defects is limited and costly we have responded to increases in insurance costs and coverage limitations by increasing our selfinsured retentions and claim reserves there can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted or become more costly if costs to resolve our future warranty and construction defect claims exceed our estimates our financial results and liquidity could be adversely affected 

a health and safety incident relating to our operations could be costly in terms of potential liabilities and reputational damage 

  

building sites are inherently dangerous and operating in the homebuilding industry poses certain inherent health and safety risks due to health and safety regulatory requirements and the number of projects we work on health and safety performance is critical to the success of all areas of our business any failure in health and safety performance may result in penalties for noncompliance with relevant regulatory requirements and a failure that results in a major or significant health and safety incident is likely to be costly and could expose us to liability that could be costly such a failure could generate significant negative publicity and have a corresponding impact on our reputation our relationships with relevant regulatory agencies or governmental authorities and our ability to attract customers and employees which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and liquidity 

damage to our corporate reputation or brands from negative publicity could adversely affect our business financial results andor stock price 

adverse publicity related to our company industry personnel operations or business performance may cause damage to our corporate reputation or brands and may generate negative sentiment potentially affecting the performance of our business or our stock price regardless of its accuracy or inaccuracy negative publicity can be disseminated rapidly through digital platforms including social media websites blogs and newsletters customers and other interested parties value readily available information and often act on such information without further investigation and without regard to its accuracy the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction and our success in preserving our brand image depends on our ability to recognize respond to and effectively manage negative publicity in a rapidly changing environment adverse publicity or unfavorable commentary from any source could damage our reputation reduce the demand for our homes or negatively impact the morale and performance of our employees which could adversely affect our business 

supply shortages and other risks related to acquiring land building materials and skilled labor could increase our costs and delay deliveries 

the homebuilding industry has from time to time experienced significant difficulties that can affect the cost or timing of construction including 

 

these factors cause us to take longer or incur more costs to build our homes and adversely affect our revenues and profitability if the level of new home demand increases significantly in future periods the risk of shortages in residential lots labor and materials available to the homebuilding industry will likely increase in some markets where we operate 

our business and financial results could be adversely affected by significant inflation higher interest rates or deflation 

inflation can adversely affect us by increasing costs of land materials and labor in addition significant inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates which have a negative impact on housing affordability in a highly inflationary environment depending on industry and other economic conditions we may be precluded from raising home prices enough to keep up with the rate of inflation which could reduce our profit margins moreover with inflation the costs of capital labor and materials can increase and the purchasing power of our cash resources can decline current or future efforts by the government to stimulate the economy may increase the risk of significant inflation and its adverse impact on our business or financial results 

alternatively a significant period of deflation could cause a decrease in overall spending and borrowing levels this could lead to deterioration in economic conditions including an increase in the rate of unemployment deflation could also cause the value of our inventories to decline or reduce the value of existing homes below the related mortgage loan balance which could potentially increase the supply of existing homes if oil prices remain low or decline further the economic conditions in markets that have significant exposure to the energy sector may weaken these or other factors that increase the risk of significant deflation could have a negative impact on our business or financial results 

we are required to obtain performance bonds the unavailability of which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

we often are required to provide surety bonds to secure our performance or obligations under construction contracts development agreements and other arrangements at september 30 2016  we had 11 billion  of outstanding surety bonds our ability to obtain surety bonds primarily depends upon our credit rating financial condition past performance and other factors including the capacity of the surety market and the underwriting practices of surety bond issuers the ability to obtain surety bonds also can be impacted by the willingness of insurance companies to issue performance bonds for construction and development activities if we are unable to obtain surety bonds when required our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

increases in the costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business or financial results 

significant expenses of owning a home including mortgage interest and real estate taxes generally are deductible expenses for an individual’s federal and in some cases state income taxes subject to various limitations under current tax law and policy if the federal government or a state government changes its income tax laws as has been discussed from time to time to eliminate or substantially modify these income tax deductions the aftertax cost of owning a new home would increase for many of our potential customers the loss or reduction of homeowner tax deductions if such tax law changes were enacted without offsetting provisions could adversely affect demand for and sales prices of new homes 

in addition increases in property tax rates by local governmental authorities as experienced in some areas in response to reduced federal and state funding could adversely affect the amount of financing our potential customers could obtain or their desire to purchase new homes 

governmental regulations and environmental matters could increase the cost and limit the availability of our development and homebuilding projects and adversely affect our business or financial results 

we are subject to extensive and complex regulations that affect land development and home construction including zoning density restrictions building design and building standards these regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities as to the conditions we must meet prior to development or construction being approved if approved at all we are subject to determinations by these authorities as to the adequacy of water or sewage facilities roads or other local services new housing developments may also be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets and other public improvements in addition in many markets government authorities have implemented no growth or growth control initiatives any of these can limit delay or increase the costs of development or home construction 

we are also subject to a significant number and variety of local state and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of health safety labor standards and the environment the impact of environmental laws varies depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available these matters may result in delays may cause us to incur substantial compliance remediation mitigation and other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas government agencies also routinely initiate audits reviews or investigations of our business practices to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations which can cause us to incur costs or create other disruptions in our business that can be significant for example we have received notices of violation from the united states environmental protection agency related to stormwater compliance at certain of our sites in the southeast this matter could potentially result in requirements for us to perform additional compliance procedures and to pay monetary sanctions 

the subcontractors we rely on to perform the actual construction of our homes are also subject to a significant number of local state and federal laws and regulations including laws involving matters that are not within our control if the subcontractors who construct our homes fail to comply with all applicable laws we can suffer reputational damage and may be exposed to possible liability 

we are also subject to an extensive number of laws and regulations because our common stock and debt securities are publicly traded in the capital markets these regulations govern our communications with our shareholders and the capital markets our financial statement disclosures and our legal processes and they also impact the work required to be performed by our independent registered public accounting firm and our legal counsel changes in these laws and regulations including the subsequent implementation of rules by the administering government authorities can require us to incur additional compliance costs and such costs can be significant 

governmental regulation of our financial services operations could adversely affect our business or financial results 

our financial services operations are subject to extensive state and federal laws and regulations which are administered by numerous agencies including but not limited to the cfpb federal housing finance agency us department of housing and urban development fha va usda fannie mae freddie mac and ginnie mae these laws and regulations include many compliance requirements including but not limited to licensing consumer disclosures fair lending and real estate settlement procedures as a result our operations are subject to regular extensive examinations by the applicable agencies 

in july 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act was enacted to establish new requirements related to residential mortgage lending practices in 2011 the cfpb was created to regulate consumer protection with regard to financial products and services in 2014 the cfpb implemented rules regarding the creation and definition of a “qualified mortgage” qm these rules created standards for lender practices regarding assessing borrowers’ ability to repay and limitations on certain fees and incentive arrangements in 2015 the cfpb’s new truth in lending  real estate settlement procedures act integrated disclosure rule trid became effective this rule implemented additional disclosure timeline requirements and fee tolerances the cfpb is currently conducting its initial examination of our subsidiary mortgage company 

in fiscal 2013 our subsidiary mortgage company was subpoenaed by the united states department of justice doj regarding the adequacy of underwriting criteria and documentation surrounding certain fha loans originated and sold in prior years we have provided information related to these loans to the   doj and communications are ongoing the doj has not asserted any claims nor provided any indication of the amount of any potential claims or penalties 

due to the significant increases in regulations operating costs have increased for our mortgage operations the possibility of additional future regulations changing rule interpretations and examinations by regulatory agencies may result in more stringent compliance standards and could adversely affect the results of our operations 

we have significant amounts of consolidated debt and may incur additional debt our debt obligations and our ability to comply with related covenants restrictions or limitations could adversely affect our financial condition 

as of september 30 2016  our consolidated debt was 33 billion  and we had 8316 million  principal amount of our debt maturing before the end of fiscal 2017  the indenture governing our senior notes does not restrict the incurrence of future unsecured debt by us or our homebuilding subsidiaries or the incurrence of secured or unsecured debt by our financial services subsidiaries and the agreement governing our revolving credit facility allows us to incur a substantial amount of future unsecured debt also the indenture governing our senior notes and the agreement governing our revolving credit facility impose restrictions on our ability and on that of the guarantors to incur debt secured by certain assets but still permit us and our homebuilding subsidiaries to incur significant amounts of additional secured debt 

possible consequences the amount and the maturities of our debt could have important consequences for example they could 

 

in addition our debt obligations and the restrictions imposed by the instruments governing those obligations expose us to additional risks including 

dependence on future performance our ability to meet our debt service and other obligations and the financial covenants under our revolving credit and mortgage repurchase facilities will depend in part upon our future financial performance our future results are subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report our revenues and earnings vary with the level of general economic activity in the markets we serve our businesses are also affected by financial political business and other factors many of which are beyond our control the factors that affect our ability to generate cash can also affect our ability to raise additional funds for these purposes through the sale of debt or equity the refinancing of debt or the sale of assets changes in prevailing interest rates may affect the cost of our debt service obligations because borrowings under our revolving credit facility and mortgage repurchase facility bear interest at floating rates 

revolving credit facility our revolving credit facility contains financial covenants requiring the maintenance of a minimum level of tangible net worth a maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and a borrowing base restriction if our ratio of debt to tangible net worth exceeds a certain level a failure to comply with these requirements could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under our revolving credit facility or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity 

mortgage repurchase facility and other restrictions the mortgage repurchase facility for our mortgage subsidiary requires the maintenance of a minimum level of tangible net worth a maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and a minimum level of liquidity by our mortgage subsidiary a failure to comply with these requirements could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds to our mortgage subsidiary or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity any difficulty experienced in complying with these covenants could make the renewal of the facility more difficult or costly 

in addition although our financial services business is conducted through subsidiaries that are not restricted by the indenture governing our senior notes or the agreement governing our revolving credit facility the ability of our financial services subsidiaries to distribute funds to our homebuilding operations would be restricted in the event such distribution would cause an event of default under the mortgage repurchase facility or if an event of default had occurred under this facility moreover our right to receive assets from these subsidiaries upon their liquidation or recapitalization is subject to the prior claims of the creditors of these subsidiaries any claims we may have to funds from our financial services subsidiaries would be subordinate to subsidiary indebtedness to the extent of any security for such indebtedness and to any indebtedness otherwise recognized as senior to our claims 

changes in debt ratings our senior unsecured debt is currently rated investment grade by two of the three major rating agencies however there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain this rating any lowering of our debt ratings could make accessing the public capital markets or obtaining additional credit from banks more difficult andor more expensive 

change of control purchase options and change of control default  upon the occurrence of both a change of control and a ratings downgrade event each as defined in the indenture governing our senior notes we will be required to offer to repurchase such notes at 101  of their principal amount together with all accrued and unpaid interest if any moreover a change of control as defined in our revolving credit facility would constitute an event of default under our revolving credit facility which could result in the acceleration of the repayment of any borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility a requirement to cash collateralize all letters of credit outstanding thereunder and the termination of the commitments thereunder if repayment of more than 50 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility were accelerated and such acceleration were not rescinded or such indebtedness were not satisfied in either case within 30 days an event of default would result under the indenture governing our senior notes entitling the trustee for the notes or holders of at least 25 percent in principal amount of the relevant series of notes then outstanding to declare all such notes to be due and payable immediately if purchase offers were required under the indenture for our notes repayment of the borrowings under our revolving credit facility were required or if our senior notes were accelerated we can give no assurance that we would have sufficient funds to pay the required amounts 

homebuilding and financial services are very competitive industries and competitive conditions could adversely affect our business or financial results 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive homebuilders compete not only for homebuyers but also for desirable properties financing raw materials and skilled labor we compete with local regional and national homebuilders and also with existing home sales foreclosures and rental properties the competitive conditions in the homebuilding industry can negatively affect our sales volumes selling prices and incentive levels reduce our profit margins and cause the value of our inventory or other assets to be impaired competition can also affect our ability to acquire suitable land raw materials and skilled labor at acceptable prices or terms or cause delays in the construction of our homes 

the competitors to our financial services businesses include other title companies and mortgage lenders including national regional and local mortgage banks and other financial institutions some of these competitors are subject to fewer governmental regulations and have greater access to capital than we do and some of them may operate with different lending criteria than we do these competitors may offer a broader or more attractive array of financing and other products and services to potential customers than we do 

our homebuilding and financial services businesses compete with other companies across all industries to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced employees managers and executives competition for the services of these individuals increases as business conditions improve in the homebuilding and financial services industries and in the general economy if we are unable to attract and retain key employees managers or executives our business could be adversely affected 

we cannot make any assurances that our growth strategies acquisitions or investments will be successful or will not expose us to additional risks 

we have primarily focused on internal growth in recent years by increasing our investments in land lot and home inventories in our existing homebuilding markets we have also expanded our business through investments in new product offerings and geographic markets investments in land lots and home inventories can expose us to risks of economic loss and inventory impairments if housing conditions weaken or if we are unsuccessful in implementing our growth strategies 

additionally we have acquired the homebuilding operations of five companies since fiscal 2012 and we may make strategic acquisitions of or investments in other companies operations or assets in the future such acquisitions and investments may have similar risks related to land lots and home inventories but they also involve the integration and oversight of the acquired operations which may require us to devote significant resources and management time and attention toward these investments we can give no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify acquire and integrate strategic acquisitions or investments in the future acquisitions can result in dilution to existing stockholders if we issue our common stock as consideration or reduce our liquidity if we fund them with cash in addition acquisitions can expose us to valuation risks including the risk of writing off goodwill or impairing inventory and other assets related to such acquisitions the risk of goodwill and asset impairments will increase during a cyclical housing downturn when our profitability may decline 

our business could be adversely affected by the loss of key personnel 

we rely on our key personnel to effectively operate and manage our homebuilding and financial services businesses specifically our success depends heavily on the performance of our homebuilding division and region presidents and their management teams our financial services management team our corporate office management teams and our executive officers these key personnel have significant experience and skills in the homebuilding and financial services industries as well as leadership and management abilities that are important to our success we seek to retain our key personnel and to have succession plans in place to address the potential loss of key personnel however if our retention and succession planning efforts are unsuccessful or if we fail to attract suitable replacements the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business 

information technology failures and data security breaches could harm our business 

we use information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational and marketing activities and to maintain our business records these information technology systems are dependent upon global communications providers web browsers thirdparty software and data storage providers and other aspects of the internet infrastructure that have experienced security breaches cyberattacks significant systems failures and service outages in the past a material breach in the security of our information technology systems or other data security controls could include the theft or release of customer employee or company data a data security breach a significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems or a breach of any of our data security controls could disrupt our business operations damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers adversely impact our sales and revenue and require us to incur significant expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve these kinds of issues the release of confidential information as a result of a security breach could also lead to litigation or other proceedings against us by affected individuals or business partners or by regulators and the outcome of such proceedings which could include penalties or fines could have a significant negative impact on our business we may also be required to incur significant costs to protect against damages caused by information technology failures or security breaches in the future we routinely utilize information technology security experts to assist us in our evaluations of the effectiveness of the security of our information technology systems and we regularly enhance our security measures to protect our systems and data however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures consequently we cannot provide assurances that a security breach cyberattack data theft or other significant systems or security failures will not occur in the future and such occurrences could have a material and adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position

in may and july of 2014 we received notices of violation from the united states environmental protection agency related to stormwater compliance at certain of our sites in the southeast this matter could potentially result in monetary sanctions to the company in an amount which we do not currently expect would be material as we cannot reasonably estimate the potential costs that may be associated with the eventual resolution of this matter we have not recorded any associated liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend 

results of operations — fiscal year 2016  overview 

during fiscal 2016  demand for new homes continued to reflect the stable to moderately improved trends we have seen across most of our operating markets over the past year we continue to see varying levels of strength in new home demand and home prices across our markets with demand in each market generally reflecting the relative strength of each market’s economy as measured by job growth household incomes household formations and consumer confidence 

our position as the largest and most geographically diverse homebuilder in the united states provides a strong platform for us to compete for new home sales in recent years we have focused on expanding our product offerings to more consistently include a broad range of homes for entrylevel moveup and luxury buyers across most of our markets our affordable entrylevel homes have experienced very strong demand from homebuyers as the entrylevel segment of the new home market remains underserved with low inventory levels relative to demand in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 we began introducing affordable homes for the active adult buyer seeking a lowmaintenance lifestyle in an agerestricted or agetargeted community we plan to continue to expand our product offerings across more of our operating markets during fiscal 2017 

in fiscal 2016  the number and value of our net sales orders increased   9  and 12  respectively compared to the prior year and the number of homes closed and home sales revenues increased   10  and 13  respectively our pretax income was 14 billion  in fiscal 2016  compared to 11 billion  and 8142 million  in fiscal 2015  and 2014  respectively our pretax operating margin was 111  in fiscal 2016  compared to 104  and 101  in fiscal 2015  and 2014  respectively during fiscal 2016  cash provided by operations was 6180 million  compared to cash provided by operations of 7004 million  in fiscal 2015  and cash used in operations of 6614 million  in fiscal 2014  in fiscal 2016 our homebuilding return on inventory roi improved to 154  compared to 128  in fiscal 2015  and 111  in fiscal 2014  homebuilding roi is calculated as homebuilding pretax income for the year divided by average inventory average inventory in the roi calculation is the sum of ending inventory balances for the trailing five quarters divided by five 

we believe our business is well positioned for the future because of our broad geographic operating base and product offerings our inventory of finished lots land and homes our strong balance sheet and liquidity and our experienced personnel across our operating markets we are focused on growing our profitability generating positive annual cash flows from operations and managing our product offerings pricing sales pace and inventory levels to optimize the return on our inventory investments 

we believe that housing demand in our individual operating markets is tied closely to each market’s economy therefore we expect that housing market conditions will vary across our markets if the us economy continues to improve we would expect to see slow to moderate growth in housing demand concentrated in markets where job growth is occurring the pace and sustainability of new home demand and our future results could be negatively affected by weakening economic conditions decreases in the level of employment and housing demand decreased home affordability significant increases in mortgage interest rates or tightening of mortgage lending standards 

strategy 

our operating strategy is focused on leveraging our financial and competitive position to increase the returns on our inventory investments while generating strong profitability and cash flows this strategy includes the following initiatives 

 

we expect our operating strategy will allow us to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity position while continuing to increase our revenues and profitability our operating strategy has produced positive results in recent years however we cannot provide any assurances that the initiatives listed above will continue to be successful and we may need to adjust components of our strategy to meet future market conditions 

key results 

key financial results as of and for our fiscal year ended september 30 2016  as compared to fiscal 2015  were as follows

financial services and other 

 

consolidated results 



results of operations — homebuilding 

our operating segments are our 39  homebuilding operating divisions which we aggregate into six  reporting segments these reporting segments which we also refer to as reporting regions have homebuilding operations located in the following states 



the following tables and related discussion set forth key operating and financial data for our homebuilding operations by reporting segment as of and for the fiscal years ended september 30 2016  2015  and 2014  as described in note a the prior year amounts presented throughout this discussion reflect certain reclassifications made to conform to the classifications used in the current year 



 





 

 

net sales orders 

2016 versus 2015 

the value of net sales orders increased   12  to 120 billion   40814  homes in 2016  from 107 billion   37380  homes in 2015  with increases in all of our regions the increases in the value of sales orders were primarily due to increases in volume and to a lesser extent increases in selling prices in most regions 

the number of net sales orders increased   9  and the average price of net sales orders increased   2  to 294000  during 2016  compared to 2015  our florida markets contributed most to the higher volume in our southeast region and our las vegas market contributed most to the higher volume in our west region the volume increases in our other regions reflect continued stable to moderately improved market conditions in these markets we believe our business is well positioned to continue to generate increased sales volume however our future sales volumes will depend on the economic strength of each of our operating markets and our ability to successfully implement our operating strategies in each market 

2015 versus 2014 

the value of net sales orders increased   29  to 107 billion   37380  homes in 2015  from 83 billion   29709  homes in 2014  with increases in all of our regions the increases in sales order value were primarily due to increases in volume as we expanded our operations and increased our market share in many of our markets to a lesser extent an increase in selling prices in our south central region also contributed to the increase in sales order value 

the number of net sales orders increased   26  and the average price of our net sales orders increased   3  to 287300  during 2015  compared to 2014  the increases in our east and southeast regions reflect the positive impact of our may 2014  acquisition of the homebuilding operations of crown communities crown communities added 527  net sales orders to the east region’s results in 2015  compared to 236  net sales orders in 2014  and added 1359  net sales orders to the southeast region’s results in 2015  compared to 508  net sales orders in 2014  



sales order backlog 

sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies including mortgage loan approval and buyers selling their existing homes which can result in cancellations a portion of the contracts in backlog will not result in closings due to cancellations 



2016 versus 2015 

revenues from home sales increased   13  to 118 billion   40309  homes closed in 2016  from 105 billion   36648  homes closed in 2015  the overall increase in home sales revenues reflects the continued stable to moderately improved market conditions in most of our markets 

the number of homes closed in fiscal 2016   increased   10  from 2015  due to increases in most of our regions our florida markets contributed most to the higher volume in our southeast region and our phoenix market contributed most to the higher volume in our southwest region the decrease in homes closed in our midwest region was primarily due to lower volume in our chicago and denver markets 

2015 versus 2014 

revenues from home sales increased   34  to 105 billion   36648  homes closed in 2015  from 78 billion   28670  homes closed in 2014  during fiscal 2015  home sales revenues increased in all of our regions as we expanded our operations and increased our market share in many of our markets 

the number of homes closed increased   28  and the average selling price of those homes increased   5  to 285700  during 2015  compared to 2014  the increases in our east and southeast regions reflect the positive impact of our may 2014  acquisition of the homebuilding operations of crown communities crown communities added 585  closings to the east region’s results in 2015  compared to 213  closings in 2014  and added 1292  closings to the southeast region’s results in 2015  compared to 508  closings in 2014  excluding the impact of crown communities the increase in homes closed in our east region was primarily due to increases in our carolina markets and in our southeast region was primarily due to increases in our florida markets the increase in our midwest region was due to increases in our chicago and denver markets in our south central region the highest percentage increases in homes closed occurred in our houston austin and fort worth markets our phoenix market contributed the most to the increase in our southwest region the increase in our west region was primarily due to increases in most of our california markets 

homebuilding operating margin analysis 



 

 

home sales gross profit 

2016 versus 2015 

gross profit from home sales increased   15  to 24 billion  in 2016  from 21 billion in 2015  and increased   40 basis points to 202  as a percentage of home sales revenues the 40  basis point increase  in the home sales gross profit percentage resulted from improvements of 30  basis points due to the average selling price of our homes closed increasing by more than the average cost and 10  basis points due to a decrease  in the amortization of capitalized interest and property taxes as a percentage of home sales revenues 

2015 versus 2014 

gross profit from home sales increased   25  to 21 billion  in 2015  from 17 billion  in 2014  and decreased   150 basis points to 198  as a percentage of home sales revenues approximately 150  basis points of the decrease  in the home sales gross profit percentage resulted from the average cost of our homes closed increasing by more than the average selling price additionally our home sales gross margin decreased approximately 20  basis points due to an increase in warranty and construction defect expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues these decreases were partially offset by a 10  basis point improvement from a decrease in the amortization of capitalized interest and property taxes as a percentage of homes sales revenues and a 10  basis point improvement related to a decrease in the amount of purchase accounting adjustments for recent acquisitions 

our gross profit margins have remained relatively stable since fiscal 2015 based on current market conditions we expect continued stability in our gross margins we remain focused on managing the pricing incentives and sales pace in each of our communities to optimize the returns on our inventory investments and adjust to local market conditions these actions could cause our gross profit margins to fluctuate in future periods 

land sales and other revenues 

land sales and other revenues were 787 million  896 million  and 538 million  in fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively we continually evaluate our land and lot supply and fluctuations in revenues and profitability from land sales can occur based on how we manage our inventory levels in various markets we generally purchase land and lots with the intent to build and sell homes on them however some of the land that we purchase includes commercially zoned parcels that we may sell to commercial developers we may also sell residential lots or land parcels to manage our supply or for other strategic reasons as of september 30 2016  we had 332 million  of land held for sale that we expect to sell in the next twelve months 

inventory and land option charges 

at the end of each quarter during fiscal 2016  we reviewed the performance and outlook for all of our land inventories and communities for indicators of potential impairment and performed detailed impairment evaluations and analyses when necessary as of september 30 2016  we performed detailed impairment evaluations of communities and land inventories with a combined carrying value of 1609 million  and recorded impairment charges of 114 million  during the fourth  quarter to reduce the carrying value of impaired communities and land to their estimated fair value total impairment charges during fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  were 203 million  449 million  and 752 million  respectively impairments in fiscal 2016  and 2015  primarily related to strategic decisions to sell inactive parcels of land most of which were in our east and southwest regions during fiscal 2016  and in our east southeast and west regions during fiscal 2015  impairments in fiscal 2014  primarily related to underperforming projects in the chicago market of our midwest region and in the suburban washington dc market of our east region 

as we manage our inventory investments across our operating markets to optimize returns and cash flows we may modify our pricing and incentives construction and development plans or land sale strategies in individual active communities and land held for development which could result in the affected communities being evaluated for potential impairment also if housing or economic conditions weaken in specific markets in which we operate or if conditions weaken in the broader economy or homebuilding industry we may be required to evaluate additional communities for potential impairment these evaluations could result in additional impairment charges

results of operations — financial services and other 

the following tables and related discussion set forth key operating and financial data for our financial services and other operations comprising dhi mortgage our subsidiary title companies and other businesses for the fiscal years ended september 30 2016  2015  and 2014  as described in note a the prior year amounts presented throughout this discussion reflect certain reclassifications made to conform to the classifications used in the current year 





financial services and other operating margin analysis 



 



mortgage loan activity 

the volume of loans originated and brokered by our mortgage operations is related to the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations in fiscal 2016  the volume of firstlien loans originated or brokered by dhi mortgage for our homebuyers increased  by 17  corresponding to the 10   increase  in the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations combined with an increase in our mortgage capture rate the percentage of total home closings by our homebuilding operations for which dhi mortgage handled the homebuyers’ financing in fiscal 2015  the volume of firstlien loans originated or brokered by dhi mortgage for our homebuyers increased by 32  corresponding to the 28   increase  in the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations our mortgage capture rate was 55  51  and 50  in fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

home closings from our homebuilding operations constituted 93  89  and 88  of dhi mortgage loan originations in fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively these rates reflect dhi mortgage’s consistent focus on the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations 

the number of loans sold increased   16  in fiscal 2016  and 30  in fiscal 2015  as compared to the respective prior years virtually all of the mortgage loans originated during recent years and mortgage loans held for sale on september 30 2016  were eligible for sale to fannie mae freddie mac or ginnie mae approximately 92  of the mortgage loans sold by dhi mortgage during fiscal 2016  were sold to four  major financial entities one of which purchased 27  of our total loans sold 

financial services and other revenues and expenses 

revenues from our financial services and other operations increased   12  to 2956 million  in fiscal 2016  from 2650 million  in fiscal 2015  and the number of loan originations also increased   12  over that same period revenues from our financial services and other operations increased 59  to 2650 million  in fiscal 2015  from 1664 million  in fiscal 2014  and the number of loan originations increased 32  in fiscal 2015  revenues increased at a higher rate than origination volume primarily due to improved loan sale execution in the secondary market and higher average loan amounts 

our mortgage operations revenues in fiscal 2016  were reduced by 85 million  to increase our loss reserves for estimated future recourse obligations and other mortgage loans and to adjust certain mortgage loans held for sale to fair value our mortgage operations revenues in fiscal 2015  and 2014  were increased by 98 million  and 22 million  respectively from decreases to our loss reserves our loss reserves for loan recourse obligations are estimated based upon analysis of the volume of mortgages originated loan repurchase requests received actual repurchases and losses through the disposition of such loans or requests and discussions with our mortgage purchasers actual losses on mortgage loans may differ from our estimates which may result in future changes to our loss reserves 

general and administrative ga expense from financial services and other operations was 2200 million  1830 million  and 1385 million  in fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively increasing   20  in 2016  and 32  in 2015  from the respective prior years these increases were primarily due to increases in employee compensation costs to support the growth in our homebuilding closing volume also new federal regulations that have recently become effective required our mortgage operations to incur significant costs for additional personnel to implement and maintain compliance with these regulations our financial services and other operations employed 1610  1342  and 1096  employees at september 30 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

as a percentage of financial services and other revenues excluding the effects of recourse expense or benefit ga expense was 723  717  and 843  in fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively the improvement during fiscal 2016 and 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was due to the relative increase in revenue and leverage of fixed overhead costs fluctuations in financial services ga expense as a percentage of revenues can be expected to occur as some components of revenue may fluctuate differently than loan volumes and some expenses are not directly related to mortgage loan volume or to changes in the amount of revenue earned 

interest and other income net of other expense included in our financial services and other operations consists primarily of the interest income of our mortgage subsidiary interest and other income in fiscal 2016  was lower than previous years due to expenses related to our other business activities which include subsidiaries that conduct insurancerelated operations construct and own incomeproducing rental properties own nonresidential real estate including ranch land and improvements and own and operate oil and gas related assets 

results of operations — consolidated 

income before income taxes 

pretax income was 14 billion  11 billion  and 8142 million  in fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively the increase in our operating income over the threeyear period is primarily due to higher revenues and home sales gross profits from increased home closings 

income taxes 

our income tax expense was 4672 million  3727 million  and 2807 million  in fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively and our effective tax rate was 345  332  and 345  respectively in those years the effective tax rate for all years includes an expense for state income taxes reduced by tax benefits for the domestic production activities deduction and federal energy tax credits the effective tax rate for fiscal 2015  also includes a tax benefit for a reduction in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and the effective tax rate for fiscal 2014  includes a tax benefit for the reduction in unrecognized tax benefits and related interest 

at september 30 2016  and 2015  we had deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities of 4866 million  and 5682 million  respectively partially offset by valuation allowances of 103 million  and 101 million  respectively we had tax benefits of 401 million  that exist for state net operating loss nol carryforwards that will expire at various times depending on the tax jurisdiction of the total amount 03 million  of the tax benefits will expire from fiscal years 2017 to 2021 129 million  will expire from fiscal years 2022 to 2026 and 269 million  will expire from fiscal years 2027 to 2036 we also had tax benefits for state tax credit carryforwards of 16 million  that will expire from fiscal years 2018 to 2019 and 13 million  of tax benefits for state tax credit carryforwards that have no expiration date the accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future results could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position also changes in existing federal and state tax laws and tax rates could affect future tax results and the valuation of our deferred tax assets 

when assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income in future periods we record a valuation allowance when we determine it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized during the fourth  quarter of fiscal 2015  we reduced the valuation allowance by 175 million  because we concluded it was more likely than not that we would realize more of our deferred tax assets related to state nol carryforwards than previously anticipated we based this conclusion on additional positive evidence related to the actual taxable income achieved during fiscal 2015  and higher levels of forecasted profitability for future years the remaining valuation allowance at september 30 2015  related to our state deferred tax assets for nol carryforwards and certain tax credit carryforwards the valuation allowance at september 30 2016  relates to our state deferred tax assets for nol carryforwards only we believe it is more likely than not that a portion of these state nol carryforwards will not be realized because some state nol carryforward periods are too brief to realize the related deferred tax assets we will continue to evaluate both the positive and negative evidence in determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to our remaining state nol carryforwards 

unrecognized tax benefits are the differences between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefits recognized for accounting purposes we had no  unrecognized tax benefits and no  accrued interest or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits at september 30 2016  and 2015  

we are subject to federal income tax and to income tax in multiple states the statute of limitations for our major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for fiscal years 2010 through 2016 we are currently being audited by various states 

capital resources and liquidity 

we have historically funded our homebuilding and financial services and other operations with cash flows from operating activities borrowings under bank credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities our current levels of cash borrowing capacity and balance sheet leverage provide us with the operational flexibility to adjust to changes in homebuilding market conditions and allow us to increase our investments in homes finished lots land and land development to expand our operations and grow our profitability 

at september 30 2016  our ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital homebuilding notes payable divided by total equity plus homebuilding notes payable was 292  compared to 361  at september 30 2015  we intend to maintain our ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital below 40  over the long term but we may choose to operate at higher levels for shortterm periods therefore future homebuilding debt to total capital ratios may be higher than the current level we believe that the ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital is useful in understanding the leverage employed in our homebuilding operations and comparing our capital structure with other homebuilders we exclude the debt of our financial services business because it is separately capitalized and its obligation under its repurchase facility is substantially collateralized and not guaranteed by our parent company or any of our homebuilding entities 

we believe that our existing cash resources our revolving credit facility and our mortgage repurchase facility provide sufficient liquidity to fund our nearterm working capital needs and debt obligations including the maturity of 3500 million  principal amount of senior notes during fiscal 2017  we regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund future growth in our business repay future debt obligations and support other general corporate and operational needs and we regularly evaluate our opportunities to raise additional capital we have an automatically effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec in august 2015 registering debt and equity securities which we may issue from time to time in amounts to be determined as market conditions permit we may issue new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets or obtain additional bank financing to fund our projected capital requirements or provide additional liquidity

in the past our mortgage subsidiary has been able to renew or extend its mortgage credit facility at a sufficient capacity and on satisfactory terms prior to its maturity and obtain temporary additional commitments through amendments to the credit agreement during periods of higher than normal volumes of mortgages held for sale the liquidity of our financial services business depends upon its continued ability to renew and extend the mortgage repurchase facility or to obtain other additional financing in sufficient capacities

in fiscal 2016  cash provided by operating activities was 6180 million  compared to 7004 million  in fiscal 2015  the most significant source of cash provided by operating activities in both years was net income 

cash used to increase our construction in progress and finished home inventory was 4962 million  compared to 631 million  of cash provided from a decrease in construction in progress and finished home inventory in fiscal 2015  the increase in our construction in progress and finished homes inventory is due to the increase in our number of homes under construction to support an expected increase in sales and closings volumes cash used to increase residential land and lots inventory was 103 million  compared to 1526 million  in fiscal 2015  

investing cash flow activities 

in fiscal 2016  net cash used in investing activities was 1126 million  compared to 954 million  in fiscal 2015  in september 2016  we acquired the homebuilding operations of wilson parker homes for 919 million  we paid 822 million  of the purchase price in cash during fiscal 2016  and expect the remaining purchase price to be paid in fiscal 2017 during fiscal 2015  we used cash to acquire the homebuilding operations of pacific ridge homes for 709 million  

we used 861 million  and 561 million  in fiscal 2016  and 2015  respectively to purchase property and equipment including model home furniture office and technology equipment and office buildings to support our operations investing cash flows during fiscal 2016  include proceeds of 358 million  from the sale of our investment in debt securities which resulted in a 45 million  gain during fiscal 2015  we used 148 million  of cash to increase our investment in the debt securities 

in fiscal 2015  we sold 177000  acres of ranch land in new mexico and all related assets including the livestock grazing rights under longterm leases on approximately 114000  acres of land to donald r horton our chairman for 560 million  in cash we recognized a gain of 23 million  related to the sale 

financing cash flow activities 

we expect the shortterm financing needs of our operations will be funded with existing cash cash generated from operations and borrowings available under our homebuilding and financial services credit facilities longterm financing needs for the growth of our operations have historically been funded with the issuance of senior unsecured debt securities through the public capital markets 

in fiscal 2016  net cash used in financing activities was 5860 million  consisting primarily of note payments and payments of cash dividends note repayments of 5497 million  included our repayment of 1702 million  principal amount of our 5625 senior notes and 3727 million  principal amount of our 65 senior notes at maturity during fiscal 2015  net cash provided by financing activities was 1170 million  consisting primarily of note proceeds partially offset by repayments of notes payable and payments of cash dividends proceeds from notes payable of 16 billion  related to our issuance of 500 million  principal amount of 40 senior notes in february 2015 draws of 9750 million  on our revolving credit facility and borrowings of 1187 million  under our mortgage repurchase facility note repayments of 15 billion  included our repayment of 13 billion  drawn on our revolving credit facility and repayment of the 1577 million  principal amount of our 525 senior notes at maturity 

our board of directors approved and paid quarterly cash dividends of 008  per common share and 00625  per common share in fiscal 2016  and 2015  respectively in november 2016  our board of directors approved a cash dividend of 010  per common share payable on december 12 2016  to stockholders of record on november 28 2016  the declaration of future cash dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon among other things our future earnings cash flows capital requirements financial condition and general business conditions 

contractual cash obligations commercial commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

our primary contractual cash obligations are payments under our debt agreements and lease payments under operating leases we expect to fund our contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business through a combination of our existing cash resources cash flows generated from profits our homebuilding and financial services credit facilities or other bank financing and the issuance of new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets as market conditions may permit 

our future cash requirements for contractual obligations as of september 30 2016  are presented below 



 

 

at september 30 2016  our homebuilding operations had outstanding letters of credit of 964 million  and surety bonds of 11 billion  issued by third parties to secure performance under various contracts we expect that our performance obligations secured by these letters of credit and bonds will generally be completed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms when we complete our performance obligations the related letters of credit and bonds are generally released shortly thereafter leaving us with no continuing obligations we have no material thirdparty guarantees 

our mortgage subsidiary enters into various commitments related to the lending activities of our mortgage operations further discussion of these commitments is provided in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” under part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

seasonality 

although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again in the future we generally close more homes and generate greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year the seasonal nature of our business can also cause significant variations in our working capital requirements in both our homebuilding and financial services operations as a result of seasonal activity our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year 

inflation 

we may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation primarily because of higher financing land labor and material construction costs we attempt to pass through to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices however during periods when housing market conditions are challenging we may not be able to offset cost increases with higher selling prices in addition higher mortgage interest rates reduce the affordability of our homes to prospective homebuyers

critical accounting policies 

general  — a comprehensive enumeration of the significant accounting policies of dr horton inc and subsidiaries is presented in note a  to the accompanying financial statements as of september 30 2016  and 2015  and for the years ended september 30 2016  2015  and 2014  each of our accounting policies has been chosen based upon current authoritative literature that collectively comprises us generally accepted accounting principles gaap in instances where alternative methods of accounting are permissible under gaap we have chosen the method that most appropriately reflects the nature of our business the results of our operations and our financial condition and have consistently applied those methods over each of the periods presented in the financial statements the audit committee of our board of directors has reviewed and approved the accounting policies selected 

revenue recognition  — we generally recognize homebuilding revenue and related profit at the time of the closing of a sale when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer in situations where the buyer’s financing is originated by dhi mortgage our 100 owned mortgage subsidiary and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment the profit is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a thirdparty purchaser has been completed any profit on land sales is deferred until the full accrual method criteria are met when appropriate revenue and profit on longterm construction projects are recognized under the percentageofcompletion method 

we include proceeds from home closings held for our benefit at title companies in homebuilding cash when we execute sales contracts with our homebuyers or when we require advance payment from homebuyers for custom changes upgrades or options related to their homes we record the cash deposits received as liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are cancelled we either retain or refund to the homebuyer deposits on cancelled sales contracts depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances 

we recognize financial services revenues associated with our title operations as closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued both of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed we transfer substantially all underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies to thirdparty insurers we typically elect the fair value option for our mortgage loan originations mortgage loans held for sale are initially recorded at fair value based on either sale commitments or current market quotes and are adjusted for subsequent changes in fair value until the loans are sold net origination costs and fees associated with mortgage loans are recognized at the time of origination the expected net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of a loan are included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings at the time of commitment we generally sell the mortgages we originate and the related servicing rights to thirdparty purchasers interest income is earned from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold 

some mortgage loans are sold with limited recourse provisions which can result in repurchases of loans previously sold to investors or payments to reimburse investors for loan losses based on historical experience discussions with our mortgage purchasers analysis of the mortgages we originated and current housing and credit market conditions we estimate and record a loss reserve for mortgage loans held in portfolio and mortgage loans held for sale as well as known and projected mortgage loan repurchase requests 

inventories and cost of sales  — inventory includes the costs of direct land acquisition land development and home construction capitalized interest real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and home construction costs that we incur after development projects or homes are substantially complete such as utilities maintenance and cleaning are charged to sga expense as incurred all indirect overhead costs such as compensation of sales personnel division and region management and the costs of advertising and builder’s risk insurance are charged to sga expense as incurred 

land and development costs are typically allocated to individual residential lots on a prorata basis and the costs of residential lots are transferred to construction in progress when home construction begins home construction costs are specifically identified and recorded to individual homes cost of sales for homes closed includes the specific construction costs of each home and all applicable land acquisition land development and related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred allocated to each residential lot based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each community any changes to the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial home closings in a community are generally allocated on a prorata basis to the remaining homes in the community associated with the relevant development activity 

when a home is closed we generally have not paid all incurred costs necessary to complete the home we record as a liability and as a charge to cost of sales the amount estimated to ultimately be paid related to completed homes that have been closed we compare our home construction budgets to actual recorded costs to determine the additional costs remaining to be paid on each closed home we monitor the accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on closed homes in subsequent months to the amounts previously accrued although actual costs to be paid in the future on previously closed homes could differ from our current accruals such differences have not been significant 

each quarter we review our communities and land inventory for indicators of potential impairment we generally review our inventory for impairment indicators at the community level and the inventory within each community is categorized as land held for development residential land and lots developed and under development land held for sale and construction in progress and finished homes based on the stage of production or plans for future development or sale a particular community often includes inventory in more than one category in certain situations inventory may be analyzed separately for impairment purposes based on its product type or future plans in reviewing each of our communities we determine if impairment indicators exist on inventory held and used by analyzing a variety of factors including but not limited to the following 

 

if indicators of impairment are present for a community we perform an impairment evaluation of the community which includes an analysis to determine if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts if so impairment charges are recorded to cost of sales if the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying amounts these estimates of cash flows are significantly impacted by community specific factors including estimates of the amounts and timing of future revenues and estimates of the amount of land development materials and labor costs which in turn may be impacted by the following local market conditions 



for those assets deemed to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets our determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams when an impairment charge for a community is determined the charge is then allocated to each lot in the community in the same manner as land and development costs are allocated to each lot impairment charges are also recorded on finished homes in substantially completed communities when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values are greater than the fair values less estimated costs to sell these homes 

for the inventory impairment analyses performed during fiscal 2016  we assumed that for the majority of communities sales prices in future periods will be equal to or lower than current sales order prices in each community or in comparable communities in order to generate an acceptable absorption rate the remaining lives of the communities evaluated were estimated to be in a range from seven months  to three years  and we utilized a range of discount rates for communities from 10  to 14  

we rarely purchase land for resale however when we own land or communities under development that do not fit into our development and construction plans and we determine that we will sell the asset the project is accounted for as land held for sale if certain criteria are met we record land held for sale at the lesser of its carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell in performing the impairment evaluation for land held for sale we consider several factors including but not limited to recent offers received to purchase the property prices for land in recent comparable sales transactions and market analysis studies which include the estimated price a willing buyer would pay for the land if the estimated fair value less costs to sell an asset is less than the current carrying value the asset is written down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell 

the key assumptions relating to inventory valuations are impacted by local market and economic conditions and are inherently uncertain although our quarterly assessments reflect management’s best estimates due to uncertainties in the estimation process actual results could differ from such estimates 

business acquisitions  — we account for acquisitions of businesses by allocating the purchase price of the business to the various assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired particularly intangible assets these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies while we believe the estimates and assumptions are reasonable they are inherently uncertain unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions 

goodwill  — we record goodwill associated with our acquisitions of businesses when the purchase price of the business exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired we evaluate our goodwill balances for potential impairment on at least an annual basis by comparing the carrying value of each of our operating segments with goodwill to their estimated fair values the estimated fair value is determined by discounting the future cash flows of the operating segment to their present value if the carrying value of the operating segment exceeds its fair value we determine if an impairment exists based on the implied fair value of the operating segment’s goodwill as a result of the goodwill evaluations performed in fiscal 2016  and 2015  impairment charges of 72 million  and 98 million  were recorded to reduce the goodwill in the huntsville operating segment in the southeast reporting region this operating segment has experienced lower levels of profitability than anticipated primarily due to difficult market conditions at september 30 2016  there was no goodwill remaining in the huntsville operating segment at september 30 2016  and 2015  our goodwill balance was 800 million  and 872 million  respectively 

warranty claims  — we typically provide our homebuyers with a tenyear limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems a twoyear limited warranty on major mechanical systems and a oneyear limited warranty on other construction components since we subcontract our construction work to subcontractors who typically provide us with an indemnity and a certificate of insurance prior to receiving payments for their work claims relating to workmanship and materials are generally the primary responsibility of the subcontractors warranty liabilities have been established by charging cost of sales for each home delivered the amounts charged are based on management’s estimate of expected warrantyrelated costs under all unexpired warranty obligation periods our warranty liability is based upon historical warranty cost experience in each market in which we operate and is adjusted to reflect qualitative risks associated with the types of homes we build and the geographic areas in which we build them actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts a 10 change in the historical warranty rates used to estimate our warranty accrual would not result in a material change in our accrual 

legal claims and insurance  — we are named as a defendant in various claims complaints and other legal actions in the ordinary course of business at any point in time we are managing several hundred individual claims related to construction defect matters personal injury claims employment matters land development issues and contract disputes we have established reserves for these contingencies based on the estimated costs of pending claims and the estimated costs of anticipated future claims related to previously closed homes approximately 93  and 99  of these reserves related to construction defect matters at september 30 2016  and 2015  respectively 

our reserves for construction defect claims include the estimated costs of both known claims and anticipated future claims as of september 30 2016  and 2015  we had reserves for approximately 140  and 185  pending construction defect claims respectively and no individual existing claim was material to our financial statements during fiscal 2016  we established reserves for approximately 90  new construction defect claims and resolved 135  construction defect claims for a total cost of 440 million  we have closed a significant number of homes during recent years and we may be subject to future construction defect claims on these homes although regulations vary from state to state construction defect issues can generally be reported for up to ten years after the home has closed in many states in which we operate historical data and trends regarding the frequency of claims incurred and the costs to resolve claims relative to the types of products and markets where we operate are used to estimate the construction defect liabilities for both existing and anticipated future claims these estimates are subject to ongoing revision as the circumstances of individual pending claims and historical data and trends change adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the accounting period in which the change in estimate occurs 

historical trends in construction defect claims have been inconsistent and we believe they may continue to fluctuate housing market conditions have been volatile across most of our markets over the past ten years and we believe such conditions can affect the frequency and cost of construction defect claims we closed a significant number of homes over the past ten years if the ultimate resolution of construction defect claims resulting from our home closings in prior years varies from current expectations it could significantly change our estimates regarding the frequency and timing of claims incurred and the costs to resolve existing and anticipated future claims which would impact the construction defect reserves in the future if the frequency of claims incurred or costs of existing and future legal claims significantly exceed our current estimates they will have a significant negative impact on our future earnings and liquidity 

we estimate and record receivables under the applicable insurance policies related to our estimated contingencies for known claims and anticipated future construction defect claims on previously closed homes and other legal claims and lawsuits incurred in the ordinary course of business when recovery is probable additionally we may have the ability to recover a portion of our losses from our subcontractors and their insurance carriers when we have been named as an additional insured on their insurance policies 

the estimation of losses related to these reserves and the related estimates of recoveries from insurance policies are subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends in construction defect claims relative to our markets and the types of products built claim frequency claim settlement costs and patterns insurance industry practices and legal interpretations among others due to the high degree of judgment required in establishing reserves for these contingencies actual future costs and recoveries from insurance could differ significantly from current estimated amounts a 10 increase in the claim frequency and the average cost per claim used to estimate the reserves would result in an increase of approximately 657 million  in our reserves and a 348 million  increase in our receivable resulting in additional expense of 309 million  a 10 decrease in the claim frequency and the average cost per claim would result in a decrease of approximately 592 million  in our reserves and a 259 million  decrease in our receivable resulting in a reduction in expense of 333 million  

income taxes  — we calculate our income tax expense benefit using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and attributable to net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards when assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income in future periods and in the jurisdictions in which those temporary differences become deductible we record a valuation allowance when we determine it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized the accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future results could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position also changes in existing federal and state tax laws and tax rates could affect future tax results and the valuation of our deferred tax assets 

interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in the financial statements as a component of income tax expense significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions we evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis our evaluations are based upon a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change 

stockbased compensation  — our stockholders formally authorize shares of our common stock to be available for future grants of stockbased compensation awards from time to time the compensation committee of our board of directors authorizes the grant of stockbased compensation to our employees and directors from these available shares at september 30 2016  our outstanding stockbased compensation awards include stock options and restricted stock units grants of restricted stock units may vest immediately or over a certain number of years as determined by the compensation committee of our board of directors restricted stock units outstanding at september 30 2016  have a remaining vesting period of 1  to 5 years  stock options are granted at exercise prices which equal the market value of our common stock at the date of the grant the stock options outstanding at september 30 2016  vest over periods of 2  to 975 years from the initial grant date and expire 10 years  after the dates on which they were granted 

the compensation expense for stockbased awards is based on the fair value of the award and is recognized on a straightline basis over the remaining vesting period the fair values of restricted stock units are based on our stock price at the date of grant the fair values of stock options granted are calculated on the date of grant using a blackscholes option pricing model determining the fair value of stock options requires judgment in developing assumptions and involves a number of estimates these estimates include but are not limited to the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards the expected dividend yield and expected stock option exercise behavior in addition we also use judgment in estimating the number of stock options that are expected to be forfeited the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense are reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows as a financing cash flow 

fair value measurements  — the fasb’s authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes a threelevel hierarchy based upon the inputs to the valuation model of an asset or liability the fair value hierarchy and its application to our assets and liabilities is as follows 

 

when available we use quoted market prices in active markets to determine fair value we consider the principal market and nonperformance risk associated with our counterparties when determining the fair value measurements if applicable fair value measurements are used for our mortgage loans held for sale debt securities collateralized by residential real estate interest rate lock commitments irlcs and other derivative instruments on a recurring basis and are used for inventories certain other mortgage loans rental properties and real estate owned on a nonrecurring basis when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers” which is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance the core principle of this guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2018 and allows for full retrospective or modified retrospective methods of adoption we are continuing to evaluate the effect of adopting asu 201409 and the manner in which we will adopt the new standard 

in august 2014 the fasb issued asu 201415 “presentation of financial statements  going concern” which provides guidance about management’s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures this guidance is intended to reduce the diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures the guidance is effective for us in our fiscal year ending september 30 2017 and is not expected to have any impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in february 2015 the fasb issued asu 201502 “consolidation” which changes the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2016 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in july 2015 the fasb issued asu 201511 “simplifying the measurement of inventory” which simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventory excluding inventory measured using the lastin firstout or retail inventory methods the guidance specifies that inventory currently measured at the lower of cost or market where market could be determined with different methods should now be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2017 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in september 2015 the fasb issued asu 201516 “business combinations simplifying the accounting for measurementperiod adjustments” which requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2016 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu 201602 “leases” which requires that lease assets and liabilities be recognized on the balance sheet and that key information about leasing arrangements be disclosed the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2019 although early adoption is permitted we are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in march 2016 the fasb issued asu 201609 “compensation  stock compensation” which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for sharebased payment transactions including the income tax consequences classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2017 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in august 2016 the fasb issued asu 201615 “statement of cash flows  classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments” which amends and clarifies the current guidance to reduce diversity in practice of the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2018 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend 

we are subject to interest rate risk on our longterm debt we monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and utilize both fixed and variable rate debt for fixed rate debt changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows conversely for variable rate debt changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument but may affect our future earnings and cash flows except in very limited circumstances we do not have an obligation to prepay fixedrate debt prior to maturity and as a result interest rate risk and changes in fair value would not have a significant impact on our cash flows related to our fixedrate debt until such time as we are required to refinance repurchase or repay such debt 

we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with our mortgage loan origination services we manage interest rate risk through the use of forward sales of mortgagebacked securities mbs which are referred to as “hedging instruments” in the following discussion we do not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate lock commitments irlcs are extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and who meet defined credit and underwriting criteria typically the irlcs have a duration of less than six months some irlcs are committed immediately to a specific purchaser through the use of bestefforts whole loan delivery commitments while other irlcs are funded prior to being committed to thirdparty purchasers the hedging instruments related to irlcs are classified and accounted for as derivative instruments in an economic hedge with gains and losses recognized in financial services revenues in the consolidated statements of operations hedging instruments related to funded uncommitted loans are accounted for at fair value with changes recognized in financial services revenues in the consolidated statements of operations along with changes in the fair value of the funded uncommitted loans the fair value change related to the hedging instruments generally offsets the fair value change in the uncommitted loans the net fair value change which for the years ended september 30 2016  and 2015  was not significant is recognized in current earnings at september 30 2016  hedging instruments used to mitigate interest rate risk related to uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale and uncommitted irlcs totaled a notional amount of 6700 million  uncommitted irlcs totaled a notional amount of approximately 4304 million  and uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale totaled a notional amount of approximately 2845 million  at september 30 2016  

the following table sets forth principal cash flows by scheduled maturity effective weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value of our debt obligations as of september 30 2016  because the mortgage repurchase facility is effectively secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale which are typically sold within 60 days its outstanding balance is included in the most current period presented the interest rate for our variable rate debt represents the weighted average interest rate in effect at september 30 2016

operating structure and processes 

following is an overview of our companys operating structure and the significant processes that support our business controls strategies and performance 

homebuilding markets 

our homebuilding business began in the dallasfort worth area which is still one of our largest local homebuilding operations and home to our corporate headquarters we currently operate in 27 states and 79  markets which provides us with geographic diversification in our homebuilding inventory investments and our sources of revenues and earnings we believe our geographic diversification lowers our operational risks by mitigating the effects of local and regional economic cycles and it also enhances our earnings potential by providing more diverse opportunities to invest in our business 

we conduct our homebuilding operations in the geographic regions states and markets listed below and we conduct our mortgage and title operations in many of these markets our homebuilding operating divisions are aggregated into six  reporting segments also referred to as reporting regions which comprise the markets below our financial statements contain additional information regarding segment performance 



when evaluating new or existing homebuilding markets for purposes of capital allocation we consider local marketspecific factors including among others 

 

economies of scale 

we are the largest homebuilding company in the united states in fiscal 2015  as measured by number of homes closed and revenues and we are also one of the largest builders in many of the markets in which we operate we believe that our national regional and local scale of operations provides us with benefits that may not be available to the same degree to some other smaller homebuilders such as 

 

decentralized homebuilding operations 

we view homebuilding as a local business therefore most of our direct homebuilding activities are decentralized to provide flexibility to our local managers on operational decisions we believe that our local management teams who are familiar with local conditions have the best information on which to base many decisions regarding their operations at september 30 2015  we had 39  separate homebuilding operating divisions many of which operate in more than one market area generally each operating division consists of a division president a controller land entitlement acquisition and development personnel a sales manager and sales and marketing personnel a construction manager and construction superintendents customer service personnel a purchasing manager and office staff our division presidents receive performance based compensation if they achieve targeted financial and operating metrics related to their operating divisions following is a summary of our homebuilding activities that are decentralized in our local operating divisions and the control and oversight functions that are centralized in our regional and corporate offices 

operating division responsibilities 

each operating division is responsible for 

 — a feasibility study 

— soil and environmental reviews 

— review of existing zoning and other governmental requirements 

— review of the need for and extent of offsite work required to obtain project entitlements and 

— financial analysis of the potential project 

 

centralized controls 

we centralize many important risk elements of our homebuilding business through our regional and corporate offices we have five separate homebuilding regional offices generally each regional office consists of a region president legal counsel a chief financial officer and limited office support staff each of our region presidents and their management teams are responsible for oversight of the operations of a number of homebuilding operating divisions including 

 

our corporate executives and corporate office departments are responsible for establishing our operational policies and internal control standards and for monitoring compliance with established policies and controls throughout our operations the corporate office also has primary responsibility for direct management of certain key risk elements and initiatives through the following centralized functions 

 

landlot acquisition and inventory management 

we acquire land for use in our homebuilding operations after we have completed due diligence and generally after we have obtained the rights known as entitlements to begin development or construction work resulting in an acceptable number of residential lots before we acquire lots or tracts of land we complete a feasibility study which includes soil tests independent environmental studies other engineering work and financial analysis we also evaluate the status of necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements required to develop and use the property for home construction although we purchase and develop land primarily to support our homebuilding activities we may sell land and lots to other developers and homebuilders where we have excess land and lot positions 

we also enter into landlot option contracts in which we obtain the right but generally not the obligation to buy land or lots at predetermined prices on a defined schedule commensurate with anticipated home closings or planned development our option contracts generally are nonrecourse which limits our financial exposure to our earnest money deposited into escrow under the terms of the contract and any preacquisition due diligence costs we incur this enables us to control land and lot positions with limited capital investment which substantially reduces the risks associated with land ownership and development 

we directly acquire almost all of our land and lot positions we are a party to a small number of joint ventures all of which are consolidated in our financial statements 

we attempt to mitigate our exposure to real estate inventory risks by 

 

land development and home construction 

substantially all of our land development and home construction work is performed by subcontractors subcontractors typically are selected after a competitive bidding process and are retained for a specific subdivision or series of house plans pursuant to a contract that obligates the subcontractor to complete the scope of work at an agreedupon price we employ land development managers and construction superintendents to monitor land development and home construction activities participate in major design and building decisions coordinate the activities of subcontractors and suppliers review the work of subcontractors for quality and cost controls and monitor compliance with zoning and building codes in addition our construction superintendents interact with our homebuyers during the construction process and instruct buyers on postclosing home maintenance 

our home designs are selected or prepared in each of our markets to appeal to the tastes and preferences of local homebuyers in each community our local management teams regularly adjust our product offerings to address our customers’ expectations for affordability home size and features in most communities we offer optional interior and exterior features to homebuyers for an additional charge construction time for our homes depends on the availability of labor materials and supplies the weather the size of the home and other factors we complete the construction of most homes within three  to six months  

we typically do not maintain significant inventories of land development or construction materials except for work in progress materials for active development projects and homes under construction generally the construction materials used in our operations are readily available from numerous sources we have contracts exceeding one year with certain suppliers of building materials that are cancelable at our option 

we are subject to governmental regulations that affect our land development and construction operations at times we have experienced delays in receiving the proper approvals from municipalities or other government agencies that have delayed our anticipated development and construction activities in individual communities 

cost controls 

we control construction costs by designing our homes efficiently and by obtaining competitive bids for construction materials and labor we also competitively bid and negotiate pricing from our subcontractors and suppliers based on the volume of services and products we purchase on a local regional and national basis we monitor our land development expenditures and construction costs versus budgets for each house and community and we review our inventory levels margins expenses profitability and returns for each operating market compared to both its business plan and our performance expectations 

we control overhead costs by centralizing certain accounting and administrative functions and by monitoring staffing and compensation levels we review other general and administrative costs to identify efficiencies and savings opportunities in our operating divisions and our regional and corporate offices we also direct many of our promotional activities toward local real estate brokers and digital marketing initiatives which we believe is an efficient use of our marketing expenditures 

marketing and sales 

in most of our markets we use the dr horton emerald homes and express homes brand names to market and sell our homes our dr horton branded communities are the core of our business and account for the substantial majority of our home closings focusing on the first time and first time moveup homebuyer our emerald branded communities introduced in fiscal 2013 appeal to buyers in search of higherend moveup and luxury homes our express branded communities were introduced in fiscal 2014 to accommodate a segment of entrylevel buyers whose focus is primarily on affordability in several markets we also use the crown communities pacific ridge homes and regent homes brands after we acquired their homebuilding operations crown and pacific ridges product offerings are similar to our dr horton communities and regents communities are similar to our express homes communities in fiscal 2015  homes marketed under our express homes and regent homes brands together represented 15  of our home closings and 10  of our home sales revenue and homes marketed under our emerald homes brand represented 3  of our home closings and 6  of our home sales revenue 

we market and sell our homes primarily through commissioned employees and the majority of our home closings also involve an independent real estate broker we typically conduct home sales from sales offices located in furnished model homes in each subdivision and we generally do not offer our model homes for sale until the completion of a subdivision our sales personnel assist prospective homebuyers by providing floor plans and price information demonstrating the features and layouts of model homes and assisting with the selection of options and other custom features we train and inform our sales personnel as to the availability of financing construction schedules and marketing and advertising plans as market conditions warrant we may provide potential homebuyers with incentives such as discounts or free upgrades to be competitive in a particular market 

we market our homes and communities to prospective homebuyers and real estate brokers through digital media including email search engine marketing social networking sites and our company website as well as through print media and advertisement we also use billboards radio television magazine and newspaper advertising as necessary in each local market we attempt to position our subdivisions in locations that are desirable to potential homebuyers and convenient to or visible from local traffic patterns which helps to reduce advertising costs model homes play a substantial role in our marketing efforts and we expend significant effort and resources to create an attractive atmosphere in our model homes 

we also build speculative homes in most of our subdivisions these homes enhance our marketing and sales efforts to prospective homebuyers who are renters or who are relocating to these markets as well as to independent brokers who often represent homebuyers requiring a home within a short time frame we determine our speculative homes strategy in each market based on local market factors such as new job growth the number of job relocations housing demand and supply seasonality current sales contract cancellation trends and our past experience in the market we maintain a level of speculative home inventory in each subdivision based on our current and planned sales pace and we monitor and adjust speculative home inventory on an ongoing basis as conditions warrant speculative homes compete effectively with existing homes available in the market and improve our profits and returns 

sales contracts and backlog 

our sales contracts require an earnest money deposit which varies in amount across our markets and subdivisions additionally customers are generally required to pay additional deposits when they select options or upgrade features for their homes our sales contracts include a financing contingency which permits customers to cancel and receive a refund of their deposit if they cannot obtain mortgage financing at prevailing or specified interest rates within a specified period our contracts may include other contingencies such as the sale of an existing home we either retain or refund customer deposits on cancelled sales contracts depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances 

sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period at september 30 2015  the value of our backlog of sales orders was 31468 million   10662  homes an increase  of 10  from 28588 million   9888  homes at september 30 2014  the average sales price of homes in backlog was 295100  at september 30 2015  up   2  from the 289100  average at september 30 2014  many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies such as those described above which can result in cancellations a portion of the contracts in backlog will not result in closings due to cancellations as a percentage of gross sales orders cancellations of sales contracts were 23  in both fiscal 2015  and 2014  

the length of time between the signing of a sales contract for a home and delivery of the home to the buyer closing is generally from two  to six months  therefore substantially all of the homes in our sales backlog at september 30 2015  are scheduled to close in fiscal year 2016  further discussion of our backlog is provided in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

customer service and quality control 

our operating divisions are responsible for preclosing quality control inspections and responding to customers’ postclosing needs we believe that a prompt and courteous response to homebuyers’ needs during and after construction reduces postclosing repair costs enhances our reputation for quality and service and ultimately leads to repeat and referral business from the real estate community and homebuyers we typically provide our homebuyers with a tenyear limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems a twoyear limited warranty on major mechanical systems and a oneyear limited warranty on other construction components the subcontractors who perform the actual construction also provide us with warranties on workmanship and are generally prepared to respond to us and the homeowner promptly upon request in addition some of our suppliers provide manufacturer’s warranties on specified products installed in the home 

customer mortgage financing 

we provide mortgage financing services principally to purchasers of our homes in the majority of our homebuilding markets through our 100 owned subsidiary dhi mortgage dhi mortgage assists in the sales transaction by coordinating the mortgage application mortgage commitment and home closing processes to facilitate a timely and efficient home buying experience for our buyers dhi mortgage originates mortgage loans for a substantial portion of our homebuyers during the year ended september 30 2015  dhi mortgage provided mortgage financing services for approximately 51  of our total homes closed and approximately 89  of dhi mortgage’s loan volume related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations most of our homebuilding divisions also work with a number of additional mortgage lenders that offer a range of mortgage financing programs to our homebuyers 

to limit the risks associated with our mortgage operations dhi mortgage originates loan products that we believe can be sold to thirdparty purchasers of mortgage loans dhi mortgage sells substantially all of the loans and their servicing rights to thirdparty purchasers shortly after origination with limited recourse provisions dhi mortgage centralizes most of its control and oversight functions including those related to loan underwriting quality control regulatory compliance secondary marketing of loans hedging activities accounting and financial reporting 

title services 

through our subsidiary title companies we serve as a title insurance agent in selected markets by providing title insurance policies examination and closing services primarily to our homebuilding customers we currently assume little or no underwriting risk associated with these title policies 

employees 

at september 30 2015  we employed 6230 persons of whom 1480  were sales and marketing personnel 1681  were involved in construction 1748  were office personnel and 1321  worked in mortgage and title operations we believe that we have good relations with our employees 

business acquisitions 

we routinely evaluate opportunities to profitably expand our operations including potential acquisitions of other homebuilding or related businesses in october 2013  we acquired the homebuilding operations of regent homes inc which operates in charlotte greensboro and winstonsalem north carolina in may 2014  we acquired the homebuilding operations of crown communities which operates in georgia south carolina and eastern alabama in april 2015  we acquired the homebuilding operations of pacific ridge homes which operates in seattle washington 

acquisitions of homebuilding businesses usually provide us with immediate land and home inventories and control of additional land and lot positions through option contracts also employees of acquired businesses generally have specialized knowledge of local market conditions including existing relationships with municipalities land owners developers subcontractors and suppliers these inventory positions and local market knowledge and relationships could take us several years to develop through our own startup efforts we seek to limit the risks associated with acquiring other companies by conducting extensive operational financial and legal due diligence on each acquisition and by performing financial analysis to determine that each acquisition will have a positive impact on our earnings within an acceptable period of time 

competition 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous other national regional and local homebuilders for homebuyers desirable properties raw materials skilled labor employees management talent and financing we also compete with resales of existing and foreclosed homes and with the rental housing market our homes compete on the basis of quality price location design and mortgage financing terms 

the competitors to our financial services businesses include other title companies and mortgage lenders including national regional and local mortgage bankers and other financial institutions some of these competitors are subject to fewer governmental regulations and have greater access to capital than we do and some of them may operate with different lending criteria and may offer a broader array of financing and other products and services to consumers than we do 

governmental regulation and environmental matters 

the homebuilding industry is subject to extensive and complex regulations we and the subcontractors we use must comply with many federal state and local laws and regulations these include zoning density and development requirements and building environmental advertising labor and real estate sales rules and regulations these regulations and requirements affect substantially all aspects of our land development and home design construction and sales processes in varying degrees across our markets our homes are inspected by local authorities where required and homes eligible for insurance or guarantees provided by the federal housing administration fha and the department of veteran affairs va are subject to inspection by them these regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities in addition our new housing developments may be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets utilities and other public improvements 

our homebuilding operations are also subject to an extensive variety of local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning protection of health safety and the environment the particular environmental laws for each site vary greatly according to location environmental condition and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties 

our mortgage company and title insurance agencies must comply with extensive federal and state laws and regulations as administered by numerous federal and state government agencies these include eligibility and other requirements for participation in the programs offered by the fha va government national mortgage association ginnie mae federal national mortgage association fannie mae federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac and the united states department of agriculture usda these laws and regulations also require compliance with consumer lending laws and other regulations governing disclosure requirements prohibitions against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures these laws and regulations subject our operations to regular extensive examinations by the applicable agencies 

seasonality 

although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again in the future we generally close more homes and generate greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year the seasonal nature of our business can also cause significant variations in our working capital requirements in both our homebuilding and financial services operations as a result of seasonal activity our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend 

discussion of our business and operations included in this annual report on form 10k should be read together with the risk factors set forth below they describe various risks and uncertainties we are or may become subject to many of which are difficult to predict or beyond our control these risks and uncertainties together with other factors described elsewhere in this report have the potential to affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner 

the homebuilding industry is cyclical and affected by changes in economic real estate or other conditions that could adversely affect our business or financial results 

the homebuilding industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic and real estate conditions such as 

 

adverse changes in these general and local economic conditions or deterioration in the broader economy would cause a negative impact on our business and financial results and increase the risk for asset impairments and writeoffs changes in these economic conditions may affect some of our regions or markets more than others if adverse conditions affect our larger markets they could have a proportionately greater impact on us than on some other homebuilding companies 

in recent years concerns regarding the us government’s fiscal policies and economic stimulus actions have created uncertainty in the financial markets and caused volatility in interest rates which has impacted business and consumer confidence federal government actions related to economic stimulus taxation and spending levels borrowing limits potential government shutdowns the implementation of federal healthcare legislation and the related political debates conflicts and compromises associated with such actions may negatively impact the financial markets and consumer confidence and spending which could hurt the us economy and the housing market such events could adversely affect our homebuilding and financial services businesses and operating results 

weather conditions and natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes wildfires volcanic activity droughts and floods can harm our homebuilding business these can delay our development work home construction and home closings adversely affect the cost or availability of materials or labor or damage homes under construction the climates and geology of many of the states in which we operate including california florida texas and other coastal areas where we have some of our larger operations present increased risks of adverse weather or natural disasters 

deployments of us military personnel to foreign regions terrorist attacks other acts of violence or threats to national security and any corresponding response by the united states or others or related domestic or international instability may cause an economic slowdown in the markets where we operate which could adversely affect our homebuilding business 

public health issues such as a major epidemic or pandemic could adversely affect our business the us and other countries have experienced and may experience in the future outbreaks of contagious diseases that affect public perception of health risk in the event of a widespread prolonged actual or perceived outbreak of a contagious disease our operations could be negatively impacted by a reduction in customer traffic or other factors which could reduce demand for new homes 

if we experience any of the foregoing potential customers may be less willing or able to buy our homes in the future our pricing and product strategies may also be limited by market conditions we may be unable to change the mix of our home offerings reduce the costs of the homes we build offer more affordable homes or satisfactorily address changing market conditions in other ways without adversely affecting our profit margins in addition cancellations of home sales contracts in backlog may increase if homebuyers do not honor their contracts due to any of the factors discussed above 

our financial services business is closely related to our homebuilding business as it originates mortgage loans principally to purchasers of the homes we build a decrease in the demand for our homes because of the foregoing matters will also adversely affect the financial results of this segment of our business an increase in the default rate on the mortgages we originate may adversely affect our ability to sell the mortgages or the pricing we receive upon the sale of mortgages or may increase our recourse obligations for previous originations we establish reserves related to mortgages we have sold however actual future obligations related to these mortgages could differ significantly from our current estimated amounts 

constriction of the credit markets could limit our ability to access capital and increase our costs of capital 

during economic and housing downturns in prior years the credit markets constricted and reduced some sources of liquidity that were previously available to us consequently we relied principally on our cash on hand to meet our working capital needs and repay outstanding indebtedness during those years there likely will be periods in the future when financial market upheaval will increase our cost of capital or limit our ability to access the public debt markets or obtain bank financing 

we have a 975 million  senior unsecured revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to 125 billion  subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments the maturity date of the commitments under the facility is september 7 2020  also our mortgage subsidiary utilizes a 400 million  mortgage repurchase facility to finance the majority of the loans it originates the capacity of the facility can be increased to 550 million  subject to the availability of additional commitments the mortgage repurchase facility must be renewed annually and currently expires on february 26 2016  we expect to renew and extend the term of the mortgage repurchase facility with similar terms prior to its maturity adverse changes in market conditions could make the renewal of these facilities more difficult or could result in an increase in the cost of these facilities or a decrease in the committed amounts such changes affecting our mortgage repurchase facility may also make it more difficult or costly to sell the mortgages that we originate 

we believe that our existing cash resources our revolving credit facility and our mortgage repurchase facility provide sufficient liquidity to fund our nearterm working capital needs and debt obligations we regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund future growth in our business repay our longerterm debt obligations and support our other general corporate and operational needs and we regularly evaluate our opportunities to raise additional capital as market conditions permit we may issue new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets or obtain additional bank financing to fund our projected capital requirements or provide additional liquidity adverse changes in economic homebuilding or capital market conditions could negatively affect our business liquidity and financial results 

reductions in the availability of mortgage financing and the liquidity provided by governmentsponsored enterprises the effects of government programs a decrease in our ability to sell mortgage loans on attractive terms or an increase in mortgage interest rates could adversely affect our business or financial results 

the mortgage lending industry has experienced significant change and contraction over the past decade credit requirements have tightened and investor demand for mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities has been predominantly limited to securities backed by fannie mae freddie mac or ginnie mae we believe that the liquidity provided by fannie mae freddie mac and ginnie mae to the mortgage industry is important to the housing market fannie mae and freddie mac received substantial injections of capital from the federal government and are still controlled by the federal government there has been ongoing discussion by the government with regard to the long term structure and viability of fannie mae and freddie mac which could result in adjustments to the size of their loan portfolios and to guidelines for their loan products any reduction in the availability of the financing provided by these institutions could adversely affect interest rates mortgage availability and sales of new homes and mortgage loans 

in addition increased lending volume and losses insured by the fha have resulted in a reduction of its insurance fund the fha insures mortgage loans that generally have lower credit requirements and is an important source for financing the sale of our homes in recent years more restrictive guidelines have been placed on fha insured loans affecting minimum down payment and availability for condominium financing and the fha has raised the premium charged to borrowers for insuring loans which has increased the cost of fha financing additional future restrictions or premium increases may negatively affect the availability or affordability of fha financing which could adversely affect our ability to sell homes 

while the use of down payment assistance programs by our homebuyers has decreased significantly some of our customers still utilize 100 financing through programs offered by the va and the usda these governmentsponsored loan programs are subject to changes in regulations lending standards and government funding levels there can be no assurances that these programs or other programs will continue to be available in our homebuilding markets or that they will be as attractive to our customers as the programs currently offered which could negatively affect our sales 

the mortgage loans originated by our financial services operations are generally sold to thirdparty purchasers during fiscal 2015  approximately 82  of our mortgage loans were sold to three  major financial entities one of which purchased 34  of the total loans sold on an ongoing basis we seek to establish loan purchase arrangements with multiple financial entities if we are unable to sell mortgage loans to purchasers on attractive terms our ability to originate and sell mortgage loans at competitive prices could be limited which would negatively affect our profitability 

even if potential customers do not need financing changes in the availability of mortgage products may make it more difficult for them to sell their current homes to potential buyers who need financing 

mortgage rates are currently low as compared to most historical periods when interest rates increase the costs of owning a home will be affected which could result in a decline in the demand for our homes 

the risks associated with our land and lot inventory could adversely affect our business or financial results 

inventory risks are substantial for our homebuilding business there are risks inherent in controlling owning and developing land if housing demand declines we may not be able to build and sell homes profitably in some of our communities and we may not be able to fully recover the costs of some of the land and lots we own also the values of our owned undeveloped land building lots and housing inventories may fluctuate significantly due to changes in market conditions as a result our deposits for lots controlled under option or similar contracts may be put at risk we may have to sell homes or land for a lower profit margin or we may have to record inventory impairment charges on our developed and undeveloped land and lots a significant deterioration in economic or homebuilding industry conditions may result in substantial inventory impairment charges 

homebuilding is subject to home warranty and construction defect claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant 

we are subject to home warranty and construction defect claims arising in the ordinary course of our homebuilding business we rely on subcontractors to perform the actual construction of our homes and in many cases to select and obtain construction materials despite our detailed specifications and monitoring of the construction process our subcontractors occasionally use improper construction processes or defective materials in the construction of our homes when we find these issues we repair them in accordance with our warranty obligations we spend significant resources to repair items in homes we have sold to fulfill the warranties we issued to our homebuyers additionally we are subject to construction defect claims which can be costly to defend and resolve in the legal system warranty and construction defect matters can also result in negative publicity in the media and on the internet which can damage our reputation and adversely affect our ability to sell homes 

based on the large number of homes we have sold over the years our potential liabilities related to warranty and construction defect claims are significant as a consequence we maintain product liability insurance and we seek to obtain indemnities and certificates of insurance from subcontractors covering claims related to their workmanship and materials we establish warranty and other reserves for the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built because of the uncertainties inherent to these matters we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will be adequate to address all of our future warranty and construction defect claims contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce we may be responsible for applicable selfinsured retentions and some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits additionally the coverage offered by and the availability of product liability insurance for construction defects is limited and costly we have responded to increases in insurance costs and coverage limitations by increasing our selfinsured retentions and claim reserves there can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted or become more costly if costs to resolve our future warranty and construction defect claims exceed our estimates our financial results and liquidity could be adversely affected 

supply shortages and other risks related to acquiring land building materials and skilled labor could increase our costs and delay deliveries 

the homebuilding industry has from time to time experienced significant difficulties that can affect the cost or timing of construction including 

 

these factors may cause us to take longer or incur more costs to build our homes and adversely affect our revenues and margins if the level of new home demand increases significantly in future periods the risk of shortages in residential lots labor and materials available to the homebuilding industry could increase in some markets where we operate 

we are required to obtain performance bonds the unavailability of which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

we often are required to provide surety bonds to secure our performance or obligations under construction contracts development agreements and other arrangements at september 30 2015  we had 10 billion  of outstanding surety bonds our ability to obtain surety bonds primarily depends upon our credit rating financial condition past performance and other factors including the capacity of the surety market and the underwriting practices of surety bond issuers the ability to obtain surety bonds also can be impacted by the willingness of insurance companies to issue performance bonds for construction and development activities if we are unable to obtain surety bonds when required our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

increases in the costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business or financial results 

significant expenses of owning a home including mortgage interest and real estate taxes generally are deductible expenses for an individual’s federal and in some cases state income taxes subject to various limitations under current tax law and policy if the federal government or a state government changes its income tax laws as has been discussed from time to time to eliminate or substantially modify these income tax deductions the aftertax cost of owning a new home would increase for many of our potential customers the loss or reduction of homeowner tax deductions if such tax law changes were enacted without offsetting provisions could adversely affect demand for and sales prices of new homes 

in addition increases in property tax rates by local governmental authorities as experienced in some areas in response to reduced federal and state funding could adversely affect the amount of financing our potential customers could obtain or their desire to purchase new homes 

our business and financial results could be adversely affected by significant inflation higher interest rates or deflation 

inflation can adversely affect us by increasing costs of land materials and labor in addition significant inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates which have a negative impact on housing affordability in a highly inflationary environment depending on industry and other economic conditions we may be precluded from raising home prices enough to keep up with the rate of inflation which could reduce our profit margins moreover with inflation the costs of capital increase and the purchasing power of our cash resources can decline current or future efforts by the government to stimulate the economy may increase the risk of significant inflation and its adverse impact on our business or financial results 

alternatively a significant period of deflation could cause a decrease in overall spending and borrowing levels this could lead to deterioration in economic conditions including an increase in the rate of unemployment deflation could also cause the value of our inventories to decline or reduce the value of existing homes below the related mortgage loan balance which could potentially increase the supply of existing homes the recent decline in oil prices may cause weaker economic conditions in markets that have significant exposure to the energy sector these or other factors that increase the risk of significant deflation could have a negative impact on our business or financial results 

governmental regulations and environmental matters could increase the cost and limit the availability of our development and homebuilding projects and adversely affect our business or financial results 

we are subject to extensive and complex regulations that affect land development and home construction including zoning density restrictions building design and building standards these regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities as to the conditions we must meet prior to development or construction being approved if approved at all we are subject to determinations by these authorities as to the adequacy of water or sewage facilities roads or other local services new housing developments may also be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets and other public improvements in addition in many markets government authorities have implemented no growth or growth control initiatives any of these can limit delay or increase the costs of development or home construction 

we are also subject to a significant number and variety of local state and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of health safety labor standards and the environment the impact of environmental laws varies depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available these matters may result in delays may cause us to incur substantial compliance remediation mitigation and other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas government agencies also routinely initiate audits reviews or investigations of our business practices to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations which can cause us to incur costs or create other disruptions in our business that can be significant for example we have received notices of violation from the united states environmental protection agency related to stormwater compliance at certain of our sites in the southeast this matter is in the early stages but could potentially result in requirements for us to perform additional compliance procedures and to pay monetary sanctions 

the subcontractors we rely on to perform the actual construction of our homes are also subject to a significant number of local state and federal laws and regulations including laws involving matters that are not within our control if the subcontractors who construct our homes fail to comply with all applicable laws we can suffer reputational damage and may be exposed to possible liability 

we are also subject to an extensive number of laws and regulations because our common stock and debt securities are publicly traded in the capital markets these regulations govern our communications with our shareholders and the capital markets our financial statement disclosures and our legal processes and they also impact the work required to be performed by our independent registered public accounting firm and our legal counsel changes in these laws and regulations including the subsequent implementation of rules by the administering government authorities can require us to incur additional compliance costs and such costs can be significant 

governmental regulation of our financial services operations could adversely affect our business or financial results 

our financial services operations are subject to a significant number of federal state and local laws and regulations any of which may limit our ability to provide mortgage financing or title services to potential purchasers of our homes these include eligibility requirements for participation in federal loan programs compliance with consumer lending laws and other regulations governing disclosure requirements prohibitions against discrimination real estate settlement procedures and foreclosure and servicing policies in recent years there has been a significant increase in regulations of the financial services industry which has increased the operating costs of our financial services companies 

in july 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act was enacted providing for a number of new requirements related to residential mortgage lending practices in 2011 the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb was created to regulate consumer protection with regard to financial products and services in january 2014 the cfpb implemented rules regarding the creation and definition of a “qualified mortgage” qm these rules created standards for lender practices regarding assessing borrowers’ ability to repay and limitations on certain fees and incentive arrangements on october 3 2015 the cfpb’s new truth in lending  real estate settlement procedures act tilarespa integrated disclosure rule became effective this rule implemented additional disclosure timeline requirements and fee tolerances which could negatively impact closing timelines adversely affecting the costs and financial results of financial services and homebuilding companies 

we have substantial amounts of consolidated debt and may incur additional debt our debt obligations and our ability to comply with related covenants restrictions or limitations could adversely affect our financial condition 

as of september 30 2015  our consolidated debt was 38 billion  and we had 10 billion  principal amount of our debt maturing before the end of fiscal 2016  the indentures governing our senior notes do not restrict the incurrence of future unsecured debt by us or our homebuilding subsidiaries or the incurrence of secured or unsecured debt by our financial services subsidiaries and the agreement governing our revolving credit facility allows us to incur a substantial amount of future unsecured debt also the indentures governing our senior notes and the agreement governing our revolving credit facility impose restrictions on our ability and on that of the guarantors to incur debt secured by certain assets but still permit us and our homebuilding subsidiaries to incur significant amounts of additional secured debt 

possible consequences the amount and the maturities of our debt could have important consequences for example they could 

 

in addition the magnitude of our debt and the restrictions imposed by the instruments governing these obligations expose us to additional risks including 

dependence on future performance our ability to meet our debt service and other obligations and the financial covenants under our revolving credit and mortgage repurchase facilities will depend in part upon our future financial performance our future results are subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report our revenues and earnings vary with the level of general economic activity in the markets we serve our businesses are also affected by financial political business and other factors many of which are beyond our control the factors that affect our ability to generate cash can also affect our ability to raise additional funds for these purposes through the sale of debt or equity the refinancing of debt or the sale of assets changes in prevailing interest rates may affect our ability to meet our debt service obligations because borrowings under our revolving credit facility and mortgage repurchase facility bear interest at floating rates 

revolving credit facility our revolving credit facility contains financial covenants requiring the maintenance of a minimum level of tangible net worth a maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and a borrowing base restriction if our ratio of debt to tangible net worth exceeds a certain level a failure to comply with these requirements could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under our revolving credit facility or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity 

mortgage repurchase facility and other restrictions the mortgage repurchase facility for our mortgage subsidiary requires the maintenance of a minimum level of tangible net worth a maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and a minimum level of liquidity by our mortgage subsidiary a failure to comply with these requirements could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds to our mortgage subsidiary or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity any difficulty experienced in complying with these covenants could make the renewal of the facility more difficult or costly 

in addition although our financial services business is conducted through subsidiaries that are not restricted by the indentures governing our senior notes or the agreement governing our revolving credit facility the ability of our financial services subsidiaries to provide funds to our homebuilding operations would be restricted in the event such distribution of funds would cause an event of default under the mortgage repurchase facility or if an event of default had occurred under this facility moreover our right to receive assets from these subsidiaries upon their liquidation or recapitalization is subject to the prior claims of the creditors of these subsidiaries any claims we may have to funds from our financial services subsidiaries would be subordinate to subsidiary indebtedness to the extent of any security for such indebtedness and to any indebtedness otherwise recognized as senior to our claims 

changes in debt ratings our senior unsecured debt is currently rated below investment grade any lowering of our debt ratings could make accessing the public capital markets or obtaining additional credit from banks more difficult andor more expensive 

change of control purchase options and change of control default  upon the occurrence of both a change of control and a ratings downgrade event each as defined in the indentures governing 28 billion  principal amount of our senior notes as of september 30 2015  we will be required to offer to repurchase such notes at 101  of their principal amount together with all accrued and unpaid interest if any moreover a change of control as defined in our revolving credit facility would constitute an event of default under our revolving credit facility which could result in the acceleration of the repayment of any borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility a requirement to cash collateralize all letters of credit outstanding thereunder and the termination of the commitments thereunder if repayment of more than 50 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility were accelerated and such acceleration were not rescinded or such indebtedness were not satisfied in either case within 30 days an event of default would result under the indentures governing our senior notes entitling the trustee for the notes or holders of at least 25 percent in principal amount of the relevant series of notes then outstanding to declare all such notes to be due and payable immediately if purchase offers were required under the indentures for such notes repayment of the borrowings under our revolving credit facility were required or if our senior notes were accelerated we can give no assurance that we would have sufficient funds to pay the required amounts 

homebuilding and financial services are very competitive industries and competitive conditions could adversely affect our business or financial results 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive homebuilders compete not only for homebuyers but also for desirable properties financing raw materials and skilled labor we compete with local regional and national homebuilders often within larger subdivisions designed planned and developed by such homebuilders we also compete with existing home sales foreclosures and rental properties the competitive conditions in the homebuilding industry can negatively affect our sales volumes selling prices and incentive levels reduce our profit margins and cause impairments in the value of our inventory or other assets competition can also affect our ability to acquire suitable land raw materials and skilled labor at acceptable prices or terms or cause delays in the construction of our homes 

the competitors to our financial services businesses include other title companies and mortgage lenders including national regional and local mortgage banks and other financial institutions some of these competitors are subject to fewer governmental regulations and have greater access to capital than we do and some of them may operate with different lending criteria than we do these competitors may offer a broader or more attractive array of financing and other products and services to potential customers than we do 

our homebuilding and financial services businesses compete with other companies across all industries to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced employees managers and executives competition for the services of these individuals will likely increase as business conditions improve in the homebuilding and financial services industries or in the general economy if we are unable to attract and retain key employees managers or executives our business could be adversely affected 

we cannot make any assurances that our growth strategies or acquisitions will be successful or not expose us to additional risks 

we have primarily focused on internal growth in recent years by increasing our investments in land lot and home inventories in our existing homebuilding markets we have also expanded our business through selected investments in new geographic markets investments in land lots and home inventories can expose us to risks of economic loss and inventory impairments if housing conditions weaken or if we are unsuccessful in implementing our growth strategies 

additionally we have acquired the homebuilding operations of four companies since fiscal 2012 and we may make strategic acquisitions of other companies or their assets in the future such acquisitions have similar risks as our other investments in land lots and home inventories but they also require the integration of the acquired operations and management we can give no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify acquire and integrate strategic acquisitions in the future acquisitions can result in dilution to existing stockholders if we issue our common stock as consideration or reduce our liquidity if we fund them with cash in addition acquisitions can expose us to valuation risks including the risk of writing off goodwill or impairing inventory and other assets related to such acquisitions the risk of goodwill and asset impairments will increase during a cyclical housing downturn when our profitability may decline 

our business could be adversely affected by the loss of key personnel 

we rely on our key personnel to effectively operate and manage our homebuilding and financial services businesses specifically our success depends heavily on the performance of our homebuilding division and region presidents and their management teams our financial services management team our corporate office management teams and our executive officers these key personnel have significant experience and skills in the homebuilding and financial services industries as well as leadership and management abilities that are important to our success we seek to have succession plans in place when we lose the services of key personnel however if we lose the services of key personnel and our succession planning efforts are unsuccessful our business could be adversely affected 

negative publicity could adversely affect our reputation as well as our business financial results and stock price 

unfavorable media related to our industry company brands marketing personnel operations business performance or customers may generate negative sentiment potentially affecting our stock price and the performance of our business regardless of its accuracy or inaccuracy the speed at which negative publicity can be disseminated has increased dramatically with the capabilities of digital communication including social media outlets websites blogs and newsletters our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt and respond to such occurrences in a rapidly changing environment overall negative sentiment resulting from adverse publicity or unfavorable commentary from any source could damage our reputation and reduce the demand for our homes which would adversely affect our business 

information technology failures and data security breaches could harm our business 

we use information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational and marketing activities and to maintain our business records these information technology systems are dependent upon global communications providers web browsers telephone systems and other aspects of the internet infrastructure that have experienced security breaches cyberattacks significant systems failures and service outages in the past a material breach in the security of our information technology systems or other data security controls could include the theft or release of customer employee or company data a data security breach a significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems or a breach of any of our data security controls could disrupt our business operations damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers adversely impact our sales and revenue and require us to incur significant expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve these kinds of issues the release of confidential information as a result of a security breach could also lead to litigation or other proceedings against us by affected individuals or business partners or by regulators and the outcome of such proceedings which could include penalties or fines could have a significant negative impact on our business we may also be required to incur significant costs to protect against damages caused by information technology failures or security breaches in the future we routinely utilize information technology security experts to assist us in our evaluations of the effectiveness of the security of our information technology systems and we regularly enhance our security measures to protect our systems and data however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures consequently we cannot provide assurances that a security breach cyberattack data theft or other significant systems or security failures will not occur in the future and such occurrences could have a material and adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position

during may and july of 2014 we received notices of violation from the united states environmental protection agency related to stormwater compliance at certain of our sites in the southeast this matter is in its early stages but could potentially result in monetary sanctions to the company in an amount which we do not currently expect would be material as we cannot reasonably estimate the potential costs that may be associated with the eventual resolution of this matter we have not recorded any associated liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend 

results of operations — fiscal year 2015  overview 

during fiscal 2015  demand for new homes reflected stable to moderately improved trends across most of our operating markets we also saw varying levels of strength in new home demand and home prices across our markets with demand in each market generally reflecting the relative strength of each market’s economy as measured by job growth household incomes household formations and consumer confidence 

our position as the largest and most geographically diverse homebuilder in the united states provides a strong platform for us to compete for new home sales in recent years we significantly increased our land lot and home inventories across our markets while maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity position in fiscal 2013 we introduced our emerald homes brand to expand our product offerings to include more moveup and luxury homes in fiscal 2014 we introduced our express homes brand to offer more affordable homes for entrylevel buyers who we believe have been underserved in the new home market in recent years these inventory investments and product introductions supported our significant growth in revenues and profitability in fiscal 2015  

in fiscal 2015  the number and value of our net sales orders increased   26  and 29  respectively compared to the prior year and the number of homes closed and home sales revenues increased   28  and 34  respectively our pretax income was 11 billion  in fiscal 2015  compared to 8142 million  and 6578 million  in fiscal 2014  and 2013  respectively during fiscal 2015  we generated cash flow from operations of 7004 million  compared to cash used in operations of 6614 million  and 12 billion  in fiscal 2014  and 2013  respectively we believe our business is well positioned for the future because of our broad geographic operating base and product offerings our inventory of finished lots land and homes and our strong balance sheet and liquidity we are focused on growing our profitability generating positive cash flows from operations and managing our product offerings pricing sales pace and inventory levels to optimize the return on our inventory investments 

we believe that housing demand in our individual operating markets is tied closely to each market’s economy therefore we expect that housing market conditions will vary across our markets if the us economy continues to improve we would expect to see slow to moderate growth in housing demand concentrated in markets where job growth is occurring the pace and sustainability of new home demand and our future results could be negatively affected by weakening economic conditions decreases in the level of employment and housing demand decreased home affordability significant increases in mortgage interest rates or tightening of mortgage lending standards 

strategy 

demand for new homes has moderately improved across many of our operating markets with varying levels of strength in demand and home prices across our individual markets based on local economic conditions in recent years we have used our liquidity and balance sheet flexibility to provide the capital to increase our investments in housing and land inventory expand our product offerings and opportunistically pursue business acquisitions we expect our revenues and profitability to increase during fiscal 2016  at a lower growth rate than we experienced in fiscal 2015  and we expect our land and lot inventories in fiscal 2016  will remain relatively consistent to slightly higher than our fiscal 2015  average inventory levels our operating strategy is focused on leveraging our financial and competitive position to increase the returns on our inventory investments and generate strong profitability and cash flows this strategy includes the following initiatives 

 

our operating strategy has produced positive results in recent years however we cannot provide any assurances that the initiatives listed above will continue to be successful and we may need to adjust components of our strategy to meet future market conditions 

key results 

key financial results as of and for our fiscal year ended september 30 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  were as follows 

homebuilding operations 

 

financial services operations 

 

consolidated results 

 

results of operations — homebuilding 

our operating segments are our 39  homebuilding operating divisions which we aggregate into six  reporting segments these reporting segments which we also refer to as reporting regions have homebuilding operations located in the following states 



fiscal year ended september 30 2015  compared to fiscal year ended september 30 2014   

the following tables and related discussion set forth key operating and financial data for our homebuilding operations by reporting segment as of and for the fiscal years ended september 30 2015  and 2014  





 

 

net sales orders 

the value of net sales orders increased   29  to 107387 million   37380  homes in 2015  from 83086 million   29709  homes in 2014  with increases in all of our regions the increases in sales order value were primarily due to increases in volume as we have expanded our operations and increased our market share in many of our markets over the past year to a lesser extent an increase in selling prices in our south central region also contributed to the increase in sales order value 

the number of net sales orders increased   26  and the average price of our net sales orders increased   3  to 287300  during 2015  compared to 2014  the increases in our east and southeast regions reflect the positive impact of our may 2014  acquisition of the homebuilding operations of crown communities crown communities added 527  net sales orders to the east regions results in 2015  compared to 236  net sales orders in 2014  and added 1359  net sales orders to the southeast regions results in 2015  compared to 508  net sales orders in 2014  we believe our business is well positioned to generate increased sales volume in fiscal 2016 at a lower growth rate than in fiscal 2015  however our future sales volumes will depend on the economic strength of each of our operating markets and our ability to successfully implement our operating strategies in each market 



sales order backlog 

sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies including mortgage loan approval and buyers selling their existing homes which can result in cancellations a portion of the contracts in backlog will not result in closings due to cancellations 



home sales revenue 

revenues from home sales increased 34  to 104694 million   36648  homes closed in 2015  from 78047 million   28670  homes closed in 2014  during the current year home sales revenues increased in all of our regions as we have expanded our operations and increased our market share in many of our markets 

the number of homes closed in fiscal 2015   increased   28  from 2014  due to increases in all of our regions the increases in our east and southeast regions reflect the positive impact of our may 2014  acquisition of the homebuilding operations of crown communities crown communities added 585  closings to the east regions results in 2015  compared to 213  closings in 2014  and added 1292  closings to the southeast regions results in 2015  compared to 508  closings in 2014  excluding the impact of crown communities the increase in homes closed in our east region was primarily due to increases in our carolina markets and in our southeast region was primarily due to increases in our florida markets the increase in our midwest region was due to increases in our chicago and denver markets in our south central region the highest percentage increases in homes closed occurred in our houston austin and fort worth markets our phoenix market contributed the most to the increase in our southwest region the increase in our west region was primarily due to increases in most of our california markets 

the average selling price of homes closed during 2015  was 285700  up   5  from the 272200  average in 2014  we are focused on managing our product offerings pricing sales pace and inventory levels in each community to optimize the returns on our inventory investments 

homebuilding operating margin analysis 



home sales gross profit 

gross profit from home sales increased   25  to 21 billion  in 2015  from 17 billion in 2014  and decreased   150 basis points to 198  as a percentage of home sales revenues 

approximately 150  basis points of the decrease  in the home sales gross profit percentage resulted from the average cost of our homes closed increasing by more than the average selling price additionally our home sales gross margin decreased approximately 20  basis points due to an increase in warranty and construction defect expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues these decreases were partially offset by a 10  basis point improvement from a decrease in the amortization of capitalized interest and property taxes as a percentage of homes sales revenues and a 10  basis point improvement related to a decrease in the amount of purchase accounting adjustments for recent acquisitions 

our gross profit margins remained relatively stable throughout all of fiscal 2015 although they declined from the prior year our gross profit margins during fiscal 2014 benefited from favorable market conditions that allowed us to increase sales prices across most of our markets with limited increases in construction costs as housing demand and inventory levels stabilized in most of our markets in the last half of fiscal 2014 and in fiscal 2015 increases in our average sales prices have moderated while our land and construction costs have increased we remain focused on managing the pricing incentives and sales pace in each of our communities to optimize the returns on our inventory investments these factors could cause further declines in our gross profit margins in future periods 

land sales and other revenues 

land sales and other revenues were 896 million  in fiscal 2015  compared to 538 million  in 2014  we continually evaluate our land and lot supply and fluctuations in revenues and profitability from land sales can occur based on how we manage our inventory levels in various markets we generally purchase land and lots with the intent to build and sell homes on them however some of the land that we purchase includes commercially zoned parcels that we may sell to commercial developers we may also sell residential lots or land parcels to manage our supply or for other strategic reasons as of september 30 2015  we had 382 million  of land held for sale that we expect to sell in the next twelve months 

inventory and land option charges 

during fiscal 2015  we reviewed the performance and outlook for all of our land inventories and communities each quarter for indicators of potential impairment and performed detailed impairment evaluations and analyses when necessary as of september 30 2015  we performed detailed impairment evaluations of communities and land inventories with a combined carrying value of 3287 million  and recorded impairment charges of 212 million  during the fourth  quarter to reduce the carrying value of impaired communities to their estimated fair value of the total fourth  quarter impairments charges of 90 million  and 60 million  related to strategic decisions to sell land in the west region and east region respectively total impairment charges during fiscal 2015  and 2014  were 449 million  and 752 million  respectively impairments in fiscal 2015  primarily related to strategic decisions to sell land in the east southeast and west regions these land parcels were purchased from fiscal 2005 through 2006 impairments in fiscal 2014  primarily related to underperforming projects in the chicago market in our midwest region and in the suburban washington dc market in our east region 

as we manage our inventory investments across our operating markets to optimize returns and cash flows we may modify our pricing and incentives construction and development plans or land sale strategies in individual active communities and land held for development which could result in the affected communities being evaluated for potential impairment also if housing or economic conditions are weak in specific markets in which we operate or if conditions weaken in the broader economy or homebuilding industry we may be required to evaluate additional communities for potential impairment these evaluations could result in additional impairment charges 

during fiscal 2015  and 2014  we wrote off 154 million  and 100 million  respectively of earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs related to land option contracts that we expect to terminate at september 30 2015  outstanding earnest money deposits associated with our portfolio of land and lot option purchase contracts totaled 791 million  

selling general and administrative sga expense 

sga expense from homebuilding activities increased   22  to 10 billion  in 2015  from 8342 million  in 2014  as a percentage of homebuilding revenues sga expense decreased   100 basis points to 96  in 2015  from 106  in 2014  this improvement in sga expense as a percentage of revenues was achieved primarily through leverage of our fixed overhead costs resulting from the significant increase in homebuilding revenues 

employee compensation and related costs represented 67  and 64  of sga costs in 2015  and 2014  respectively these costs increased  by 27  to 6816 million  in 2015  from 5369 million  in 2014  due to increases in the number of employees and equity and incentive compensation as compared to the prior year our homebuilding operations employed approximately 4909  and 4525 employees at september 30 2015  and 2014  respectively 

we attempt to control our sga costs while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports our operations however we cannot make assurances that we will be able to maintain or improve upon the current sga expense as a percentage of revenues 

interest incurred 

interest incurred decreased   9  to 1692 million  in fiscal 2015  compared to 2014  while our average debt increased   6  the decrease in interest incurred in the current year was due to a decrease in the average interest rate of our debt as compared to the prior year the decrease in the average interest rate was primarily a result of the conversion of our convertible senior notes into shares of common stock during april and may of 2014 these convertible senior notes had an effective interest rate of 99  

we capitalize interest costs incurred to inventory during active development and construction active inventory capitalized interest is charged to cost of sales as the related inventory is delivered to the buyer during periods in which our active inventory is lower than our debt level a portion of the interest incurred is reflected as interest expense in the period incurred during fiscal 2015 and 2014 our active inventory exceeded our debt level and all interest incurred was capitalized to inventory interest charged to cost of sales declined  to 19  of total cost of sales excluding inventory and land option charges in fiscal 2015  from 20  in fiscal 2014  

other income 

other income net of other expenses included in our homebuilding operations was 184 million  in fiscal 2015  compared to 131 million  in 2014  other income consists of interest income income from insurance related activities rental income income and expenses associated with oil and gas activities income and expenses from other assets and various other types of ancillary income gains expenses and losses not directly associated with our core homebuilding operations the activities that result in this ancillary income or expense are not significant either individually or in the aggregate 

goodwill impairment 

we performed our annual goodwill impairment evaluation in the fourth  quarter of fiscal 2015  as a result of this analysis we determined the goodwill balance related to the huntsville operating segment in our southeast reporting region was impaired this operating segment has experienced lower levels of profitability than anticipated primarily due to difficult market conditions consequently during the fourth quarter we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 98 million  see note a

in october 2013  we acquired the homebuilding operations of regent homes inc for 345 million  in cash regent homes operates in charlotte greensboro and winstonsalem north carolina the assets acquired included approximately 240  homes in inventory 300  lots and control of approximately 600  additional lots through option contracts we also acquired a sales order backlog of 213  homes valued at 311 million

the following tables set forth key operating and financial data for our financial services operations comprising dhi mortgage and our subsidiary title companies for the fiscal years ended september 30 2015  and 2014  





financial services operating margin analysis 



 

 

mortgage loan activity 

the volume of loans originated and brokered by our mortgage operations is related to the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations in fiscal 2015  the volume of firstlien loans originated or brokered by dhi mortgage for our homebuyers increased  by 32  corresponding to the increase  in the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations of 28  our mortgage capture rate the percentage of total home closings by our homebuilding operations for which dhi mortgage handled the homebuyers’ financing was 51  in fiscal 2015  up slightly from 50  in fiscal 2014  

home closings from our homebuilding operations constituted 89  of dhi mortgage loan originations in 2015  compared to 88  in 2014  these rates reflect dhi mortgage’s consistent focus on the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations 

the number of loans sold in 2015   increased   30  from the number sold in 2014  virtually all of the mortgage loans originated during fiscal 2015  and mortgage loans held for sale on september 30 2015  were eligible for sale to fannie mae freddie mac or ginnie mae approximately 82  of the mortgage loans sold by dhi mortgage during fiscal 2015  were sold to three  major financial entities one of which purchased 34  of our total loans sold 

financial services revenues and expenses 

revenues from the financial services segment increased   59  to 2650 million  in fiscal 2015  from 1664 million  in fiscal 2014  the number of loan originations increased   32  while the revenues generated by our mortgage operations increased   67  revenues increased at a higher rate than origination volume primarily due to improved loan sale execution in the secondary market and higher average loan amounts 

our mortgage operations revenues in fiscal 2015  include 98 million  of revenues related to reductions in our estimated future recourse obligations compared to 22 million  in fiscal 2014  the reduction in estimated future recourse obligations in fiscal 2015 was due to pursuing resolutions with various mortgage purchasers for amounts that were lower than had been previously estimated our loss reserve for loan recourse obligations is estimated based upon an analysis of loan repurchase requests received our actual repurchases and losses through the disposition of such loans or requests discussions with our mortgage purchasers and analysis of the mortgages we originated while we believe that we have adequately reserved for losses on known and projected repurchase requests actual repurchase volume or actual losses incurred resolving those repurchases could differ from our expectations which may result in a change in our loss reserves 

financial services general and administrative ga expense increased   31  to 1724 million  in 2015  from 1312 million  in 2014  as a percentage of financial services revenues excluding the effects of recourse benefit ga expense was 676  in 2015  compared to 799  in 2014  the improvement was due to the relative increase in revenue and leverage of fixed overhead costs fluctuations in financial services ga expense as a percentage of revenues can be expected to occur as some components of revenue may fluctuate differently than loan volumes and some expenses are not directly related to mortgage loan volume or to changes in the amount of revenue earned 

results of operations — consolidated 

fiscal year ended september 30 2015  compared to fiscal year ended september 30 2014 

income before income taxes 

pretax income for fiscal 2015  was 11 billion  compared to 8142 million  for fiscal 2014  the increase in our operating income for the current year compared to a year ago is primarily due to higher revenues and home sales gross profits from increased home closings 

income taxes 

our income tax expense in fiscal 2015  was 3727 million  compared to 2807 million  in 2014  our effective tax rate was 332  in fiscal 2015  compared to 345  in fiscal 2014  the effective tax rate for fiscal 2015  includes an expense for state income taxes that was reduced by a tax benefit for the domestic production activities deduction and a tax benefit for a reduction in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets the effective tax rate for fiscal 2014  includes an expense for state income taxes that was reduced by a tax benefit for the domestic production activities deduction and a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits and the related interest 

the accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future results could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position also changes in existing federal and state tax laws and tax rates could affect future tax results and the valuation of our deferred tax assets at september 30 2015  and 2014  we had deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities of 5682 million  and 5961 million  respectively partially offset by valuation allowances of 101 million  and 311 million  respectively we had tax benefits of 585 million  that exist for state net operating loss nol carryforwards that will expire at various times depending on the tax jurisdiction of the total amount 18 million  of the tax benefits will expire from fiscal years 2016 to 2020 198 million  will expire from fiscal years 2021 to 2025 and 369 million  will expire from fiscal years 2026 to 2035 we also had tax benefits for state tax credit carryforwards of 54 million  that will expire from fiscal years 2017 to 2026 and 22 million  of tax benefits for state tax credit carryforwards that have no expiration date 

when assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income in future periods we record a valuation allowance when we determine it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the valuation allowance for both fiscal 2015  and 2014  relates to our state deferred tax assets for nol carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards we believe it is more likely than not that a portion of our state nol carryforwards and state tax credits will not be realized because some state nol and tax credit carryforward periods are too brief to realize the related deferred tax assets during the fourth  quarter of fiscal 2015  we concluded it was more likely than not that we would realize more of our deferred tax assets related to state nol carryforwards than previously anticipated we based this conclusion on additional positive evidence related to the actual taxable income achieved during fiscal 2015  and higher levels of forecasted profitability for future years accordingly during the fourth  quarter we reduced the valuation allowance by 175 million  as a result of this additional positive evidence as of september 30 2015  the remaining valuation allowance on state deferred tax assets is 101 million  we will continue to evaluate both the positive and negative evidence in determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to our remaining state nol carryforwards and state tax credits 

unrecognized tax benefits are the differences between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefits recognized for accounting purposes we had no  unrecognized tax benefits at september 30 2015  and 2014  

we are subject to federal income tax and to income tax in multiple states the statute of limitations for our major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for fiscal years 2010 through 2015 we are currently being audited by various states 

results of operations — homebuilding 

fiscal year ended september 30 2014  compared to fiscal year ended september 30 2013   

the following tables and related discussion set forth key operating and financial data for our homebuilding operations by reporting segment as of and for the fiscal years ended september 30 2014  and 2013  





 

 

net sales orders 

the value of net sales orders increased   27  to 83086 million   29709  homes in 2014  from 65670 million   25120  homes in 2013  with significant increases in four of our six regions the increases in sales order value in those regions were primarily due to increases in volume as we expanded our operations and increased our market share in many of our markets during fiscal 2014  to a lesser extent and to varying degrees increases in selling prices also contributed to the value of net sales orders in each region 

the number of net sales orders increased   18  and the average price of our net sales orders increased   7  to 279700  during 2014  compared to 2013  the largest percentage increase in net sales orders occurred in our east region reflecting the positive impact of our acquisitions of the homebuilding operations of regent homes and crown communities which contributed 714  net sales orders to the east region in 2014  crown communities also contributed 508  net sales orders to the southeast region in 2014  the decreases in net sales orders that occurred in our midwest and southwest regions were primarily due to decreases in sales orders in our minnesota colorado phoenix and albuquerque markets 



sales order backlog 

our homes in backlog at september 30 2014  increased 21  from the prior year the largest percentage increase in our sales order backlog occurred in our east region reflecting the positive impact of our acquisitions of the homebuilding operations of regent homes and crown communities which contributed 377  homes to our east region backlog at september 30 2014  crown communities also contributed 305  homes to our southeast region backlog at september 30 2014  



home sales revenue 

revenues from home sales increased   30  to 78047 million   28670  homes closed in 2014  from 60248 million   24155  homes closed in 2013  during fiscal 2014  home sales revenues increased in most of our regions as we expanded our operations and increased our market share in many of our markets 

the number of homes closed in fiscal 2014   increased   19  from 2013  due to increases in four of our six regions the most significant percentage increase occurred in our east region reflecting the positive impact of our acquisitions of the homebuilding operations of regent homes and crown communities which contributed 676  closings to the east region in 2014  crown communities also contributed 508  closings to the southeast region in 2014  excluding the impact of crown communities the increase in homes closed in our southeast region was primarily due to increases in our jacksonville and atlanta markets in our south central region the highest percentage increases in homes closed occurred in our fort worth dallas and houston markets the increase in our west region was primarily due to increases in our bay area portland and sacramento markets the decrease in home closings in our southwest region was primarily due to weak demand in the phoenix market compared to the prior year and in our midwest region the decrease was attributable to our colorado and chicago markets 

the average selling price of homes closed during 2014  was 272200  up   9  from the 249400  average in 2013  as the level of home price increases began to moderate during fiscal 2014 



home sales gross profit 

gross profit from home sales increased   33  to 17 billion  in 2014  from 13 billion  in 2013  and increased   50 basis points to 213  as a percentage of home sales revenues approximately 40  basis points of the increase in the home sales gross profit percentage resulted from the average selling price of our homes closed increasing by more than the average home cost 20  basis points of the increase resulted from a decrease in the amortization of capitalized interest and property taxes as a percentage of homes sales revenues and 10  basis points of the increase resulted from lower costs for warranty and construction defect claims as a percentage of home sales revenue partially offsetting these increases was a 20  basis point decrease from purchase accounting adjustments related to the acquisitions of crown communities and regent homes 

our gross profit margins during fiscal 2013 and throughout the first half of fiscal 2014 benefited significantly from favorable market conditions that allowed us to increase sales prices across most of our markets while we limited increases in construction costs our gross profit margins also benefited from reduced interest amortized to cost of sales as our average borrowing costs declined the increases in our average sales prices moderated in the second half of fiscal 2014 and we managed the sales pace in each of our communities by adjusting the pricing incentives and product mix to optimize the returns on our inventory investments these factors caused our gross profit margins in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2014 to decline as compared to the prior year quarters and to the first two quarters of fiscal 2014 

land sales and other revenues 

land sales and other revenues were 538 million  in fiscal 2014  compared to 611 million  in 2013  revenues in fiscal 2013  included revenue of 200 million  from a longterm construction project for which we served as the general contractor 

inventory and land option charges 

as of september 30 2014  we performed detailed impairment evaluations of communities and land inventories with a combined carrying value of 3598 million  and we recorded impairment charges of 181 million  during the fourth quarter to reduce the carrying value of impaired communities to their estimated fair value total impairment charges during fiscal 2014  and 2013  were 752 million  and 213 million  respectively 

of the total impairment charges in fiscal 2014  493 million  occurred in our midwest region primarily related to communities in chicago that were purchased predominantly in 2004 through 2007 and had been previously impaired during the third quarter of fiscal 2014 we reduced home prices and identified land parcels we intended to sell in these chicago communities in an effort to increase sales pace reduce inventories and improve cash flows and returns in contrast to most of our markets during fiscal 2014  the chicago housing market remained weak with sales absorptions and returns in these communities performing below our expectations given the size of our investments 

also during fiscal 2014  177 million  of impairment charges occurred in our east region these impairments primarily related to longheld inactive and underperforming projects in the suburban washington dc market 

during fiscal 2014  and 2013  we wrote off 100 million  and 98 million  respectively of earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs related to land option contracts at september 30 2014  outstanding earnest money deposits associated with our portfolio of land and lot option purchase contracts totaled 587 million  

selling general and administrative sga expense 

sga expense from homebuilding activities increased   28  to 8342 million  in 2014  from 6499 million  in 2013  as a percentage of homebuilding revenues sga expense decreased   10 basis points to 106  in 2014  from 107  in 2013  

employee compensation and related costs represented 64  and 65  of sga costs in 2014  and 2013  respectively these costs increased  by 26  to 5369 million  in 2014  from 4252 million  in 2013  mainly due to an increase in our number of employees and an increase in incentive compensation related to the increase in profitability in many of our divisions in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 our homebuilding operations employed approximately 4525  and 3600 employees at september 30 2014  and 2013  respectively 

interest incurred 

interest incurred increased   8  to 1858 million  in fiscal 2014  as compared to 2013  due to an 18   increase  in our average debt interest incurred in fiscal 2014  increased by a lower percentage than the increase in our average debt as a result of a decrease in the average interest rate of our debt as compared to fiscal 2013  

during a portion of fiscal 2013 our active inventory was lower than our debt level and therefore a portion of the interest incurred was reflected as interest expense however since the third quarter of fiscal 2013 our active inventory has exceeded our debt level and all interest incurred has been capitalized to inventory as a result no  interest was expensed during fiscal 2014  compared to 71 million  during 2013  interest charged to cost of sales declined  to 20  of total cost of sales excluding inventory and land option charges in fiscal 2014  from 23  in fiscal 2013  due to the growth in our active inventory relative to our debt balance and a decrease in the average interest rate on our outstanding debt 

other income 

other income net of other expenses included in our homebuilding operations was 131 million  in fiscal 2014  compared to 149 million  in 2013  other income consists of interest income rental income income from insurance related activities income and expenses associated with other assets and various other types of ancillary income gains expenses and losses not directly associated with our core homebuilding operations the activities that result in this ancillary income or expense are not significant either individually or in the aggregate

financial services operating margin analysis 



 

 

mortgage loan activity 

in fiscal 2014  the volume of firstlien loans originated or brokered by dhi mortgage for our homebuyers increased by 5  while the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations increased  by 19  this was due to a decrease in our mortgage capture rate the percentage of total home closings by our homebuilding operations for which dhi mortgage handled the homebuyers’ financing to 50  in fiscal 2014  from 56  in fiscal 2013  the decrease in capture rate was due to an increase in home closings in markets not served by dhi mortgage as well as a more competitive mortgage pricing market as compared to the prior year 

home loans to customers of our homebuilding operations constituted 88  of dhi mortgage loan originations in 2014  compared to 86  in 2013  these rates reflect dhi mortgage’s consistent focus on the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations 

the number of loans sold in 2014  increased slightly from the number sold in 2013  virtually all of the mortgage loans originated during fiscal 2014  and mortgage loans held for sale on september 30 2014  were eligible for sale to fannie mae freddie mac or ginnie mae approximately 71  of the mortgage loans sold by dhi mortgage during fiscal 2014  were sold to four  major financial institutions and the largest concentration of total loans sold to one institution was 28  

financial services revenues and expenses

results of operations — consolidated 

fiscal year ended september 30 2014  compared to fiscal year ended september 30 2013   

income before income taxes 

pretax income for fiscal 2014  was 8142 million  compared to 6578 million  for fiscal 2013  the increase in our operating income for 2014  compared to 2013  was primarily due to higher revenues and home sales gross profits from increased home closings 

income taxes 

our income tax expense in fiscal 2014  was 2807 million  compared to 1951 million  in 2013  our effective tax rate was 345  in fiscal 2014  compared to 297  in fiscal 2013  the effective tax rate for fiscal 2014  includes an expense for state income taxes that was reduced by a tax benefit for the domestic production activities deduction and a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits and the related interest in fiscal 2013  a reduction in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets as well as a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits and related interest contributed to the low effective tax rate 

at september 30 2014  and 2013  we had deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities of 5961 million  and 6176 million  respectively partially offset by valuation allowances of 311 million  and 310 million  respectively at september 30 2014  we had tax benefits of 845 million  for state nol carryforwards that expire at various times depending on the tax jurisdiction of the total amount 53 million  of the tax benefits expire from fiscal years 2015 to 2019 265 million  expire from fiscal years 2020 to 2024 and 527 million  expire from fiscal years 2025 to 2034 we also had state tax credit carryforwards of 57 million  that expire from fiscal years 2018 to 2024 and 19 million  of state tax credit carryforwards that had no expiration date 

we had no  unrecognized tax benefits at september 30 2014  and 42 million  of unrecognized tax benefits at september 30 2013  during fiscal 2014  and 2013  we recognized interest benefits related to unrecognized tax benefits of 22 million  and 28 million  respectively in our consolidated statements of operations at september 30 2014  we had no  accrued interest or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits at september 30 2013  we had 22 million  of accrued interest and no  accrued penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits 

capital resources and liquidity 

we have historically funded our homebuilding and financial services operations with cash flows from operating activities borrowings under bank credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities our current levels of cash borrowing capacity and balance sheet leverage provide us with the operational flexibility to adjust to changes in homebuilding market conditions and allow us to increase our investments in homes finished lots land and land development to expand our operations and grow our profitability 

at september 30 2015  our ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital was 361  compared to 392  at september 30 2014  our ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital homebuilding notes payable net of cash divided by total equity plus homebuilding notes payable net of cash was 251  at september 30 2015  compared to 343  at september 30 2014  we intend to maintain our ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital at or below 40  over the long term but we may choose to operate above 40  for shortterm periods therefore future homebuilding debt to total capital ratios may be higher than the current level 

we believe that the ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital is useful in understanding the leverage employed in our homebuilding operations and comparing our capital structure with other homebuilders because of its capital function we include our homebuilding cash as a reduction of our homebuilding debt and total capital we exclude the debt of our financial services business because it is separately capitalized and its obligation under its repurchase agreement is substantially collateralized and not guaranteed by our parent company or any of our homebuilding entities 

we believe that our existing cash resources our revolving credit facility and our mortgage repurchase facility provide sufficient liquidity to fund our nearterm working capital needs and debt obligations including the maturity of 5429 million  principal amount of senior notes during fiscal 2016  we regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund future growth in our business repay our future debt obligations and support our other general corporate and operational needs and we regularly evaluate our opportunities to raise additional capital we have an automatically effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec in august 2015 registering debt and equity securities which we may issue from time to time in amounts to be determined as market conditions permit we may issue new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets or obtain additional bank financing to fund our projected capital requirements or provide additional liquidity

mortgage repurchase facility  — our mortgage subsidiary dhi mortgage has a mortgage repurchase facility that is accounted for as a secured financing the mortgage repurchase facility provides financing and liquidity to dhi mortgage by facilitating purchase transactions in which dhi mortgage transfers eligible loans to the counterparties against the transfer of funds by the counterparties thereby becoming purchased loans dhi mortgage then has the right and obligation to repurchase the purchased loans upon their sale to thirdparty purchasers in the secondary market or within specified time frames from 45  to 60  days in accordance with the terms of the mortgage repurchase facility in february 2015 the mortgage repurchase facility was amended and its maturity date was extended to february 26 2016  additionally new commitments were obtained from banks which increased the total capacity of the facility to 400 million  the amendment allows for the capacity of the facility to be increased further without requiring additional commitments from 400 million  to 450 million  during the last five days of any fiscal quarter and the first twentyfive days of the following fiscal quarter additionally the capacity of the facility can be increased to 550 million  subject to the availability of additional commitments through additional commitments the capacity of the facility was temporarily increased to 5325 million at september 30 2015

the mortgage repurchase facility is not guaranteed by dr horton inc or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt the facility contains financial covenants as to the mortgage subsidiary’s minimum required tangible net worth its maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and its minimum required liquidity these covenants are measured and reported to the lenders monthly at september 30 2015  dhi mortgage was in compliance with all of the conditions and covenants of the mortgage repurchase facility 

in the past our mortgage subsidiary has been able to renew or extend its mortgage credit facility at a sufficient capacity and on satisfactory terms prior to its maturity and obtain temporary additional commitments through amendments to the credit agreement during periods of higher than normal volumes of mortgages held for sale the liquidity of our financial services business depends upon its continued ability to renew and extend the mortgage repurchase facility or to obtain other additional financing in sufficient capacities

in fiscal 2015  cash provided by operating activities was 7004 million  compared to 6614 million  of cash used in operating activities in fiscal 2014  the most significant source of cash provided by operating activities in both years was net income cash used to increase mortgage loans held for sale in fiscal 2015  was 1541 million  compared to 818 million  in fiscal 2014  as we experienced higher home closing and loan origination volume as compared to fiscal 2014  

cash provided by a decrease in our construction in progress and finished home inventory was 631 million  compared to 9182 million  of cash used to increase construction in progress and finished home inventory in fiscal 2014  we used 1526 million  of cash to increase our residential land and lot inventory through purchases of land and finished lots and land development activity compared to 5136 million  in fiscal 2014  in recent years we significantly increased our land lot and home inventories across our markets which supported the growth in our revenues and profitability in fiscal 2015  during fiscal 2016 we expect our land and lot inventories will remain relatively consistent to slightly higher than our average inventory levels in fiscal 2015

financing cash flow activities 

we expect the shortterm financing needs of our operations will be funded with existing cash cash generated from profits and borrowings available under our homebuilding and financial services credit facilities longterm financing needs for the growth of our operations have historically been funded with the issuance of senior unsecured debt securities through the public capital markets 

in fiscal 2015  net cash provided by financing activities was 1170 million  consisting primarily of note proceeds partially offset by repayments of notes payable and payments of cash dividends proceeds from notes payable of 16 billion  included 4970 million  related to our issuance of 500 million  principal amount of 40 senior notes in february 2015 draws of 10 billion  on our revolving credit facility and borrowings of 1187 million  under our mortgage repurchase facility note repayments of 15 billion  included our repayment of 13 billion  drawn on our revolving credit facility and repayment of the remaining 1577 million  principal amount of our 525 senior notes at maturity during fiscal 2014  net cash provided by financing activities was 6279 million  consisting primarily of note proceeds partially offset by repayments of notes payable and payments of cash dividends proceeds from notes payable of 14 billion  related to our issuance of 500 million  principal amount of 375 senior notes in february 2014 draws of 8100 million  on our revolving credit facility and borrowings of 1206 million  under our mortgage repurchase facility note repayments of 7969 million  included our repayment of 5100 million  drawn on our revolving credit facility and repayment of senior notes at maturity including the remaining 1459 million  principal amount of our 6125 senior notes and the remaining 1379 million  principal amount of our 5625 senior notes

contractual cash obligations commercial commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

our primary contractual cash obligations for our homebuilding and financial services segments are payments under our debt agreements and lease payments under operating leases we expect to fund our contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business through a combination of our existing cash resources cash flows generated from profits our homebuilding and financial services credit facilities or other bank financing and the issuance of new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets as market conditions may permit 

our future cash requirements for contractual obligations as of september 30 2015  are presented below 



 

 

at september 30 2015  our homebuilding operations had outstanding letters of credit of 1130 million  which were cash collateralized and surety bonds of 10 billion  issued by third parties to secure performance under various contracts we expect that our performance obligations secured by these letters of credit and bonds will generally be completed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms when we complete our performance obligations the related letters of credit and bonds are generally released shortly thereafter leaving us with no continuing obligations we have no material thirdparty guarantees 

our mortgage subsidiary enters into various commitments related to the lending activities of our mortgage operations further discussion of these commitments is provided in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” under part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts to acquire land or lots for the construction of homes lot option contracts enable us to control significant lot positions with limited capital investment and substantially reduce the risks associated with land ownership and development among our land and lot option purchase contracts at september 30 2015  there were a limited number of contracts representing 259 million  of remaining purchase price subject to specific performance provisions which may require us to purchase the land or lots upon the land sellers meeting their contractual obligations further information about our land option contracts is provided in the “inventories land and lot position and homes in inventory” section included herein 

seasonality 

although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again in the future we generally close more homes and generate greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year the seasonal nature of our business can also cause significant variations in our working capital requirements in both our homebuilding and financial services operations as a result of seasonal activity our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year 

inflation 

we may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation primarily because of higher financing land labor and material construction costs in addition higher mortgage interest rates reduce the affordability of mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers we attempt to pass through to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices however during periods when housing market conditions are challenging we may not be able to offset our cost increases with higher selling prices

critical accounting policies 

general  — a comprehensive enumeration of the significant accounting policies of dr horton inc and subsidiaries is presented in note a  to the accompanying financial statements as of september 30 2015  and 2014  and for the years ended september 30 2015  2014  and 2013  each of our accounting policies has been chosen based upon current authoritative literature that collectively comprises us generally accepted accounting principles gaap in instances where alternative methods of accounting are permissible under gaap we have chosen the method that most appropriately reflects the nature of our business the results of our operations and our financial condition and have consistently applied those methods over each of the periods presented in the financial statements the audit committee of our board of directors has reviewed and approved the accounting policies selected 

revenue recognition  — we generally recognize homebuilding revenue and related profit at the time of the closing of a sale when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer in situations where the buyer’s financing is originated by dhi mortgage our 100 owned mortgage subsidiary and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment the profit is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a thirdparty purchaser has been completed any profit on land sales is deferred until the full accrual method criteria are met when appropriate revenue and profit on longterm construction projects are recognized under the percentageofcompletion method 

we include proceeds from home closings held for our benefit at title companies in homebuilding cash when we execute sales contracts with our homebuyers or when we require advance payment from homebuyers for custom changes upgrades or options related to their homes we record the cash deposits received as liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are cancelled we either retain or refund to the homebuyer deposits on cancelled sales contracts depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances 

we recognize financial services revenues associated with our title operations as closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued both of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed we transfer substantially all underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies to thirdparty insurers we typically elect the fair value option for our mortgage loan originations mortgage loans held for sale are initially recorded at fair value based on either sale commitments or current market quotes and are adjusted for subsequent changes in fair value until the loans are sold net origination costs and fees associated with mortgage loans are recognized at the time of origination the expected net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of a loan are included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings at the time of commitment we generally sell the mortgages we originate and the related servicing rights to thirdparty purchasers interest income is earned from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold 

some mortgage loans are sold with limited recourse provisions which can result in repurchases of loans previously sold to investors or payments to reimburse investors for loan losses based on historical experience discussions with our mortgage purchasers analysis of the mortgages we originated and current housing and credit market conditions we estimate and record a loss reserve for mortgage loans held in portfolio and mortgage loans held for sale as well as known and projected mortgage loan repurchase requests 

inventories and cost of sales  — inventory includes the costs of direct land acquisition land development and home construction capitalized interest real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and home construction costs that we incur after development projects or homes are substantially complete such as utilities maintenance and cleaning are charged to sga expense as incurred all indirect overhead costs such as compensation of sales personnel division and region management and the costs of advertising and builder’s risk insurance are charged to sga expense as incurred 

land and development costs are typically allocated to individual residential lots on a prorata basis and the costs of residential lots are transferred to construction in progress when home construction begins home construction costs are specifically identified and recorded to individual homes cost of sales for homes closed includes the specific construction costs of each home and all applicable land acquisition land development and related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred allocated to each residential lot based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each community any changes to the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial home closings in a community are generally allocated on a prorata basis to the remaining homes in the community associated with the relevant development activity 

when a home is closed we generally have not paid all incurred costs necessary to complete the home we record as a liability and as a charge to cost of sales the amount we estimate will ultimately be paid related to completed homes that have been closed we compare our home construction budgets to actual recorded costs to determine the additional costs remaining to be paid on each closed home we monitor the accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on closed homes in subsequent months to the amounts previously accrued although actual costs to be paid in the future on previously closed homes could differ from our current accruals such differences have not been significant 

each quarter the performance and outlook of land inventory and communities under development are reviewed for indicators of potential impairment we generally review our inventory for impairment indicators at the community level and the inventory within each community is categorized as land held for development residential land and lots developed and under development land held for sale and construction in progress and finished homes based on the stage of production or plans for future development or sale a particular community often includes inventory in more than one category in certain situations inventory may be analyzed separately for impairment purposes based on its product type or future plans in reviewing each of our communities we determine if impairment indicators exist on inventory held and used by analyzing a variety of factors including but not limited to the following 

 

if indicators of impairment are present for a community we perform an impairment evaluation of the community which includes an analysis to determine if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts and if so impairment charges are recorded to cost of sales if the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying amounts these estimates of cash flows are significantly impacted by community specific factors including estimates of the amounts and timing of future revenues and estimates of the amount of land development materials and labor costs which in turn may be impacted by the following local market conditions 

 

for those assets deemed to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets our determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams when an impairment charge for a community is determined the charge is then allocated to each lot in the community in the same manner as land and development costs are allocated to each lot impairment charges are also recorded on finished homes in substantially completed communities when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values are greater than the fair values less estimated costs to sell these homes 

for the inventory impairment analyses performed during fiscal 2015  we assumed that for the majority of communities sales prices in future periods will be equal to or lower than current sales order prices in each community or in comparable communities in order to generate an acceptable absorption rate the remaining lives of the communities evaluated were estimated to be in a range from nine months  to five years  and we utilized a range of discount rates for communities from 12  to 15  

we rarely purchase land for resale however when we own land or communities under development that do not fit into our development and construction plans and we determine that we will sell the asset the project is accounted for as land held for sale if certain criteria are met we record land held for sale at the lesser of its carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell in performing the impairment evaluation for land held for sale we consider several factors including but not limited to recent offers received to purchase the property prices for land in recent comparable sales transactions and market analysis studies which include the estimated price a willing buyer would pay for the land if the estimated fair value less costs to sell an asset is less than the current carrying value the asset is written down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell 

the key assumptions relating to inventory valuations are impacted by local market and economic conditions and are inherently uncertain although our quarterly assessments reflect management’s best estimates due to uncertainties in the estimation process actual results could differ from such estimates 

business acquisitions  — we account for acquisitions of businesses by allocating the purchase price of the business to the various assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired particularly intangible assets these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies while we believe the estimates and assumptions are reasonable they are inherently uncertain unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions 

goodwill  — we record goodwill associated with our acquisitions of businesses when the purchase price of the business exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired we evaluate our goodwill balances for potential impairment on at least an annual basis by comparing the carrying value of each of our operating segments with goodwill to their estimated fair values the estimated fair value is determined by discounting the future cash flows of the operating segment to their present value if the carrying value of the operating segment exceeds its fair value we determine if an impairment exists based on the implied fair value of the operating segments goodwill as a result of the goodwill evaluation performed in fiscal 2015  a goodwill impairment charge of 98 million  was recorded to reduce the goodwill in the huntsville operating segment in our southeast reporting region at september 30 2015  and 2014  our goodwill balance was 872 million  and 948 million  respectively 

warranty claims  — we typically provide our homebuyers with a tenyear limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems a twoyear limited warranty on major mechanical systems and a oneyear limited warranty on other construction components since we subcontract our construction work to subcontractors who typically provide us with an indemnity and a certificate of insurance prior to receiving payments for their work claims relating to workmanship and materials are generally the primary responsibility of the subcontractors warranty liabilities have been established by charging cost of sales for each home delivered the amounts charged are based on management’s estimate of expected warrantyrelated costs under all unexpired warranty 

obligation periods our warranty liability is based upon historical warranty cost experience in each market in which we operate and is adjusted as appropriate to reflect qualitative risks associated with the types of homes we build and the geographic areas in which we build them actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts a 10 change in the historical warranty rates used to estimate our warranty accrual would not result in a material change in our accrual 

legal claims and insurance  — we are named as a defendant in various claims complaints and other legal actions in the ordinary course of business at any point in time we are managing several hundred individual claims related to construction defect matters personal injury claims employment matters land development issues and contract disputes we have established reserves for these contingencies based on the estimated costs of pending claims and the estimated costs of anticipated future claims related to previously closed homes at both september 30 2015  and 2014  approximately 99  of these reserves related to construction defect matters 

our reserves for construction defect claims include the estimated costs of both known claims and anticipated future claims as of september 30 2015  and 2014  we had reserves for approximately 185  and 180  pending construction defect claims respectively and no individual existing claim was material to our financial statements during fiscal 2015  we established reserves for approximately 85  new construction defect claims and resolved 80  construction defect claims for a total cost of 342 million  the majority of our total construction defect reserves consists of the estimated exposure to future claims on previously closed homes we have closed a significant number of homes during recent years and we may be subject to future construction defect claims on these homes although regulations vary from state to state construction defect issues can generally be reported for up to ten years after the home has closed in many states in which we operate historical data and trends regarding the frequency of claims incurred and the costs to resolve claims relative to the types of products and markets where we operate are used to estimate the construction defect liabilities for both existing and anticipated future claims these estimates are subject to ongoing revision as the circumstances of individual pending claims and historical data and trends change adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the accounting period in which the change in estimate occurs 

historical trends in construction defect claims have been inconsistent and we believe they may continue to fluctuate over the next several years housing market conditions have been volatile across most of our markets over the past ten years and we believe such conditions can affect the frequency and cost of construction defect claims we closed a significant number of homes over the past ten years if the ultimate resolution of construction defect claims resulting from our home closings in prior years varies from current expectations it could significantly change our estimates regarding the frequency and timing of claims incurred and the costs to resolve existing and anticipated future claims which would impact the construction defect reserves in the future if the frequency of claims incurred or costs of existing and future legal claims significantly exceed our current estimates they will have a significant negative impact on our future earnings and liquidity 

we estimate and record receivables under the applicable insurance policies related to our estimated contingencies for known claims and anticipated future construction defect claims on previously closed homes and other legal claims and lawsuits incurred in the ordinary course of business when recovery is probable additionally we may have the ability to recover a portion of our losses from our subcontractors and their insurance carriers when we have been named as an additional insured on their insurance policies 

the estimation of losses related to these reserves and the related estimates of recoveries from insurance policies are subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends in construction defect claims relative to our markets and the types of products built claim frequency claim settlement costs and patterns insurance industry practices and legal interpretations among others due to the high degree of judgment required in establishing reserves for these contingencies actual future costs and recoveries from insurance could differ significantly from current estimated amounts a 10 increase in the claim frequency and the average cost per claim used to estimate the reserves would result in an increase of approximately 865 million  in our reserves and a 487 million  increase in our receivable resulting in additional expense of 378 million  a 10 decrease in the claim frequency and the average cost per claim would result in a decrease of approximately 734 million  in our reserves and a 354 million  decrease in our receivable resulting in a reduction in expense of 380 million  

income taxes  — we calculate our income tax expense benefit using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and of tax loss and credit carryforwards when assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income in future periods and in the jurisdictions in which those temporary differences become deductible we record a valuation allowance when we determine it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized the accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future results could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position also changes in existing federal and state tax laws and tax rates could affect future tax results and the valuation of our deferred tax assets 

interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in the financial statements as a component of income tax expense significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions we evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis our evaluations are based upon a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change 

stockbased compensation  — our common stockholders formally authorize shares of our common stock to be available for future grants of stockbased compensation awards from time to time the compensation committee of our board of directors authorizes the grant of stockbased compensation to our employees and directors from these available shares at september 30 2015  our outstanding stockbased compensation awards include stock options and restricted stock units grants of restricted stock units may vest immediately or over a certain number of years as determined by the compensation committee of our board of directors restricted stock units outstanding at september 30 2015  have a remaining vesting period of 1  to 5 years  stock options are granted at exercise prices which equal the market value of our common stock at the date of the grant the stock options outstanding at september 30 2015  vest over periods of 2  to 975 years from the initial grant date and expire 10 years  after the dates on which they were granted 

the compensation expense for stockbased awards is based on the fair value of the award and is recognized on a straightline basis over the remaining vesting period the fair values of restricted stock units are based on our stock price at the date of grant the fair values of stock options granted are calculated on the date of grant using a blackscholes option pricing model determining the fair value of stock options requires judgment in developing assumptions and involves a number of estimates these estimates include but are not limited to the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards the expected dividend yield and expected stock option exercise behavior in addition we also use judgment in estimating the number of stock options that are expected to be forfeited the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense are reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows as a financing cash flow 

fair value measurements  — the fasb’s authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes a threelevel hierarchy based upon the inputs to the valuation model of an asset or liability the fair value hierarchy and its application to our assets and liabilities is as follows 

 

when available we use quoted market prices in active markets to determine fair value we consider the principal market and nonperformance risk associated with our counterparties when determining the fair value measurements if applicable fair value measurements are used for our mortgage loans held for sale debt securities collateralized by residential real estate interest rate lock commitments irlcs and other derivative instruments on a recurring basis and are used for inventories certain other mortgage loans rental properties and real estate owned on a nonrecurring basis when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in january 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu 201404 “receivables  troubled debt restructurings by creditors” which was revised in august 2014 asu 201404 applies to all creditors who obtain physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan in satisfaction of a receivable the guidance clarifies when an insubstance repossession or foreclosure of the property has occurred and helps determine when a creditor should derecognize a loan receivable and recognize real estate property asu 201414 applies to creditors that hold governmentguaranteed mortgage loans and requires that these loans including those guaranteed by the federal housing administration fha and veterans affairs va be derecognized and that a separate receivable be recognized upon foreclosure if certain conditions are met upon foreclosure the separate receivable should be measured based on the amount of the loan balance expected to be recovered from the guarantor the guidance was effective for us beginning october 1 2015 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in april 2014 the fasb issued asu 201408 “presentation of financial statements and property plant and equipment  reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity” this guidance changes the criteria for determining whether disposals are reported as discontinued operations and modifies related disclosure requirements we adopted asu 201408 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers” which is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance the core principle of this guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2018 and allows for full retrospective or modified retrospective methods of adoption we are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in august 2014 the fasb issued asu 201415 “presentation of financial statements  going concern” which provides guidance about managements responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the entitys ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures this guidance is intended to reduce the diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures the guidance is effective for us in our fiscal year ending september 30 2017 and is not expected to have any impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in february 2015 the fasb issued asu 201502 “consolidation” which changes the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2016 and is not expected to have a material impact on our current consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in july 2015 the fasb issued asu 201511 “simplifying the measurement of inventory” which simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventory excluding inventory measured using the lastin firstout or retail inventory methods the guidance specifies that inventory currently measured at the lower of cost or market where market could be determined with different methods should now be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2017 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in september 2015 the fasb issued asu 201516 “business combinations simplifying the accounting for measurementperiod adjustments” which requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2016 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

we are subject to interest rate risk on our longterm debt we monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and utilize both fixed and variable rate debt for fixed rate debt changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows conversely for variable rate debt changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument but may affect our future earnings and cash flows except in very limited circumstances we do not have an obligation to prepay fixedrate debt prior to maturity and as a result interest rate risk and changes in fair value would not have a significant impact on our cash flows related to our fixedrate debt until such time as we are required to refinance repurchase or repay such debt 

we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with our mortgage loan origination services we manage interest rate risk through the use of forward sales of mortgagebacked securities mbs which are referred to as “hedging instruments” in the following discussion we do not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate lock commitments irlcs are extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and who meet defined credit and underwriting criteria typically the irlcs have a duration of less than six months some irlcs are committed immediately to a specific purchaser through the use of bestefforts whole loan delivery commitments while other irlcs are funded prior to being committed to thirdparty purchasers the hedging instruments related to irlcs are classified and accounted for as derivative instruments in an economic hedge with gains and losses recognized in financial services revenues in the consolidated statements of operations hedging instruments related to funded uncommitted loans are accounted for at fair value with changes recognized in financial services revenues in the consolidated statements of operations along with changes in the fair value of the funded uncommitted loans the fair value change related to the hedging instruments generally offsets the fair value change in the uncommitted loans the net fair value change which for the years ended september 30 2015  and 2014  was not significant is recognized in current earnings at september 30 2015  hedging instruments used to mitigate interest rate risk related to uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale and uncommitted irlcs totaled a notional amount of 6810 million  uncommitted irlcs totaled a notional amount of approximately 3332 million  and uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale totaled a notional amount of approximately 3853 million  at september 30 2015  

the following table sets forth principal cash flows by scheduled maturity effective weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value of our debt obligations as of september 30 2015  because the mortgage repurchase facility is effectively secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale which are typically sold within 60 days its outstanding balance is included in the most current period presented the interest rate for our variable rate debt represents the weighted average interest rate in effect at september 30 2015

donald r horton began our homebuilding business in 1978 in fort worth texas in 1991 we were incorporated in delaware to acquire the assets and businesses of our predecessor companies which were residential home construction and development companies owned or controlled by mr horton in 1992 we completed the initial public offering of our common stock our company expanded and diversified its operations geographically over the years by investing available capital into our existing homebuilding markets and into startup operations in new markets as well as by acquiring other homebuilding companies our product offerings across our operating markets are broad and diverse our homes range in size from 1000  to more than 4000 square feet and in price from 100000  to more than 1000000  for the year ended september 30 2014  we closed 28670  homes with an average sales price of approximately 272200  

through our financial services operations we provide mortgage financing and title agency services to homebuyers in many of our homebuilding markets dhi mortgage our 100 owned subsidiary provides mortgage financing services primarily to our homebuilding customers and generally sells the mortgages it originates and the related servicing rights to thirdparty purchasers dhi mortgage originates loans in accordance with purchaser guidelines and sells substantially all of its mortgage production shortly after origination our subsidiary title companies serve as title insurance agents by providing title insurance policies examination and closing services primarily to our homebuilding customers 

our financial reporting segments consist of six homebuilding segments and a financial services segment our homebuilding operations are the most substantial part of our business comprising approximately 98  of consolidated revenues which totaled 80 billion  in fiscal 2014  our homebuilding operations generate most of their revenues from the sale of completed homes with a lesser amount from the sale of land and lots approximately 90  of our home sales revenue in fiscal 2014  came from the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes with the remainder from attached homes such as town homes duplexes triplexes and condominiums our financial services segment generates its revenues from originating and selling mortgages and collecting fees for title insurance agency and closing services 

in addition to our homebuilding and financial services operations we have ancillary activities that are related to our homebuilding business and real estate holdings but are not components of our core homebuilding operations these include the activities of our captive insurance subsidiary and other insurancerelated subsidiaries subsidiaries that own rental properties and collect rental income and subsidiaries that own incomeproducing assets such as nonresidential real estate mineral rights and other rights or assets these ancillary activities and the related income or loss are not significant either individually or in the aggregate

operating structure and processes 

following is an overview of our companys operating structure and the significant processes that support our business controls strategies and performance 

homebuilding markets 

our homebuilding business began in the dallasfort worth area which is still one of our largest local homebuilding operations and home to our corporate headquarters we currently operate in 27 states and 79  markets which provides us with geographic diversification in our homebuilding inventory investments and our sources of revenues and earnings we believe our geographic diversification lowers our operational risks by mitigating the effects of local and regional economic cycles and it also enhances our earnings potential by providing more diverse opportunities to invest in our business 

we conduct our homebuilding operations in the geographic regions states and markets listed below and we conduct our mortgage and title operations in many of these markets our homebuilding operating divisions are aggregated into six reporting segments also referred to as reporting regions which comprise the markets below our financial statements contain additional information regarding segment performance 



when evaluating new or existing homebuilding markets for purposes of capital allocation we consider local marketspecific factors including among others 

 

economies of scale 

we are the largest homebuilding company in the united states in fiscal 2014  as measured by number of homes closed and revenues and we are also one of the largest builders in many of the markets in which we operate we believe that our national regional and local scale of operations provides us with benefits that may not be available to the same degree to some other smaller homebuilders such as 

 

decentralized homebuilding operations 

we view homebuilding as a local business therefore most of our direct homebuilding activities are decentralized which provides flexibility to our local managers on operational decisions at september 30 2014  we had 37  separate homebuilding operating divisions many of which operate in more than one market area generally each operating division consists of a division president a controller land entitlement acquisition and development personnel a sales manager and sales and marketing personnel a construction manager and construction superintendents customer service personnel a purchasing manager and office staff we believe that our division presidents and their management teams who are familiar with local conditions generally have the best information on which to base many decisions regarding their operations our division presidents receive performance based compensation if they achieve targeted financial and operating metrics related to their operating divisions following is a summary of our homebuilding activities that are decentralized in our local operating divisions and the control and oversight functions that are centralized in our regional and corporate offices 

operating division responsibilities 

each operating division is responsible for 

 — a feasibility study 

— soil and environmental reviews 

— review of existing zoning and other governmental requirements 

— review of the need for and extent of offsite work required to obtain project entitlements and 

— financial analysis of the potential project 

 

centralized controls 

we centralize many important risk elements of our homebuilding business through our regional and corporate offices we have five separate homebuilding regional offices generally each regional office consists of a region president legal counsel a chief financial officer and limited office support staff each of our region presidents and their management teams are responsible for oversight of the operations of a number of homebuilding operating divisions including 

 

our corporate executives and corporate office departments are responsible for establishing our operational policies and internal control standards and for monitoring compliance with established policies and controls throughout our operations the corporate office also has primary responsibility for direct management of certain key risk elements and initiatives through the following centralized functions 

 

cost controls 

we control construction costs by designing our homes efficiently and by obtaining competitive bids for construction materials and labor we also competitively bid and negotiate pricing from our subcontractors and suppliers based on the volume of services and products we purchase on a local regional and national basis we monitor our land development expenditures and construction costs versus budgets for each house and community and we review our inventory levels margins expenses profitability and returns for each operating market compared to both its business plan and our performance expectations 

we control overhead costs by centralizing certain accounting and administrative functions and by monitoring staffing and compensation levels we review other general and administrative costs to identify efficiencies and savings opportunities in our operating divisions and our regional and corporate offices we also direct many of our promotional activities toward local real estate brokers which we believe is an efficient use of our marketing expenditures 

landlot acquisition and inventory management 

we acquire land for use in our homebuilding operations after we have completed due diligence and generally after we have obtained the rights known as entitlements to begin development or construction work resulting in an acceptable number of residential lots before we acquire lots or tracts of land we complete a feasibility study which includes soil tests independent environmental studies other engineering work and financial analysis we also evaluate the status of necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements required to develop and use the property for home construction although we purchase and develop land primarily to support our homebuilding activities we may sell land and lots to other developers and homebuilders where we have excess land and lot positions 

we also enter into landlot option contracts in which we obtain the right but generally not the obligation to buy land or lots at predetermined prices on a defined schedule commensurate with anticipated home closings or planned development our option contracts generally are nonrecourse which limits our financial exposure to our earnest money deposited into escrow under the terms of the contract and any preacquisition due diligence costs we incur this enables us to control land and lot positions with limited capital investment which substantially reduces the risks associated with land ownership and development 

we directly acquire almost all of our land and lot positions we are a party to a small number of joint ventures all of which are consolidated in our financial statements 

we attempt to mitigate our exposure to real estate inventory risks by 

 

land development and home construction 

substantially all of our land development and home construction work is performed by subcontractors subcontractors typically are selected after a competitive bidding process and are retained for a specific subdivision or series of house plans pursuant to a contract that obligates the subcontractor to complete the scope of work at an agreedupon price we employ land development managers and construction superintendents to monitor land development and home construction activities participate in major design and building decisions coordinate the activities of subcontractors and suppliers review the work of subcontractors for quality and cost controls and monitor compliance with zoning and building codes in addition our construction superintendents play a significant role in working with our homebuyers by assisting with option selection and home modification decisions educating buyers on the construction process and instructing buyers on postclosing home maintenance 

our home designs are selected or prepared in each of our markets to appeal to the tastes and preferences of local homebuyers in each community we offer optional interior and exterior features to allow homebuyers to enhance the basic home design and to allow us to generate additional revenues from each home sold we continually adjust our product offerings to address our customers’ expectations for affordability home size and features construction time for our homes depends on the availability of labor materials and supplies the weather the size of the home and other factors we complete the construction of most homes within three  to six months  

we typically do not maintain significant inventories of land development or construction materials except for work in progress materials for active development projects and homes under construction generally the construction materials used in our operations are readily available from numerous sources we have contracts exceeding one year with certain suppliers of building materials that are cancelable at our option 

we are subject to governmental regulations that affect our land development and construction activities at times we have experienced delays because of the entitlement process which is dependent upon receiving the proper approvals from municipalities that may not be adequately staffed 

marketing and sales 

in most of our markets we use the dr horton emerald homes and express homes brand names to market and sell our homes our dr horton branded communities are the core of our business and account for the substantial majority of our home closings focusing on the first time and first time moveup homebuyer our emerald branded communities introduced in fiscal 2013 appeal to buyers in search of higherend moveup and luxury homes our express branded communities were introduced in fiscal 2014 to accommodate a segment of entrylevel buyers whose focus is primarily on affordability in several markets we also use the crown communities breland homes and regent homes brands after we acquired their homebuilding operations crown and brelands product offerings are similar to our dr horton communities and regents communities are similar to our express homes communities homes marketed under our express homes and regent homes brands together represented 5  of our fiscal 2014 home closings and homes marketed under our emerald homes brand represented 2  of our fiscal 2014 home closings 

we market and sell our homes primarily through commissioned employees and the majority of our home closings also involve an independent real estate broker we typically conduct home sales from sales offices located in furnished model homes in each subdivision and we generally do not offer our model homes for sale until the completion of a subdivision our sales personnel assist prospective homebuyers by providing floor plans and price information demonstrating the features and layouts of model homes and assisting with the selection of options and other custom features we train and inform our sales personnel as to the availability of financing construction schedules and marketing and advertising plans as market conditions warrant we may provide potential homebuyers with one or more of a variety of incentives including discounts and free upgrades to be competitive in a particular market 

we market our homes and communities to prospective homebuyers and real estate brokers through electronic media including email social networking sites and our company website as well as brochures flyers newsletters and promotional events we also use billboards radio television magazine and newspaper advertising as necessary in each local market we attempt to position our subdivisions in locations that are desirable to potential homebuyers and convenient to or visible from local traffic patterns which helps to reduce advertising costs model homes play a substantial role in our marketing efforts and we expend significant effort and resources to create an attractive atmosphere in our model homes 

we also build speculative homes in most of our subdivisions these homes enhance our marketing and sales efforts to prospective homebuyers who are renters or who are relocating to these markets as well as to independent brokers who often represent homebuyers requiring a home within a short time frame we determine our speculative homes strategy in each market based on local market factors such as new job growth the number of job relocations housing demand and supply seasonality current sales contract cancellation trends and our past experience in the market we maintain a level of speculative home inventory in each subdivision based on our current and planned sales pace and we monitor and adjust speculative home inventory on an ongoing basis as conditions warrant speculative homes help to provide us with opportunities to compete effectively with existing homes available in the market and improve our profits and returns 

sales contracts and backlog 

our sales contracts require an earnest money deposit which varies in amount across our markets and subdivisions additionally customers are generally required to pay additional deposits when they select options or upgrade features for their homes our sales contracts include a financing contingency which permits customers to cancel and receive a refund of their deposit if they cannot obtain mortgage financing at prevailing or specified interest rates within a specified period our contracts may include other contingencies such as the sale of an existing home we either retain or refund customer deposits on canceled sales contracts depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances 

sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period at september 30 2014  the value of our backlog of sales orders was 28588 million   9888  homes an increase  of 29  from 22101 million   8205  homes at september 30 2013  the average sales price of homes in backlog was 289100  at september 30 2014  up   7  from the 269400  average at september 30 2013  many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies such as those described above which can result in cancellations a portion of the contracts in backlog will not result in closings due to cancellations as a percentage of gross sales orders cancellations of sales contracts were 23  and 24  in fiscal 2014  and 2013  respectively 

the length of time between the signing of a sales contract for a home and delivery of the home to the buyer closing is generally from two  to six months  therefore substantially all of the homes in our sales backlog at september 30 2014  are scheduled to close in fiscal year 2015  further discussion of our backlog is provided in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

customer service and quality control 

our operating divisions are responsible for preclosing quality control inspections and responding to customers’ postclosing needs we believe that a prompt and courteous response to homebuyers’ needs during and after construction reduces postclosing repair costs enhances our reputation for quality and service and ultimately leads to repeat and referral business from the real estate community and homebuyers we typically provide our homebuyers with a tenyear limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems a twoyear limited warranty on major mechanical systems and a oneyear limited warranty on other construction components the subcontractors who perform the actual construction also provide us with warranties on workmanship and are generally prepared to respond to us and the homeowner promptly upon request in addition some of our suppliers provide manufacturer’s warranties on specified products installed in the home 

customer mortgage financing 

we provide mortgage financing services principally to purchasers of our homes in the majority of our homebuilding markets through our 100 owned subsidiary dhi mortgage dhi mortgage assists in the sales transaction by coordinating the mortgage application mortgage commitment and home closing processes to facilitate a timely and efficient home buying experience for our buyers dhi mortgage originates mortgage loans for a substantial portion of our homebuyers during the year ended september 30 2014  dhi mortgage provided mortgage financing services for approximately 50  of our total homes closed and approximately 88  of dhi mortgage’s loan volume related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations most of our homebuilding divisions also work with a number of additional mortgage lenders that offer a range of mortgage financing programs to our homebuyers 

to limit the risks associated with our mortgage operations dhi mortgage originates loan products that we believe can be sold to thirdparty purchasers of mortgage loans dhi mortgage sells substantially all of the loans and their servicing rights to thirdparty purchasers shortly after origination with limited recourse provisions dhi mortgage centralizes most of its control and oversight functions including those related to loan underwriting quality control regulatory compliance secondary marketing of loans hedging activities accounting and financial reporting 

title services 

through our subsidiary title companies we serve as a title insurance agent in selected markets by providing title insurance policies examination and closing services primarily to our homebuilding customers we currently assume little or no underwriting risk associated with these title policies 

employees 

at september 30 2014  we employed 5621 persons of whom 1364  were sales and marketing personnel 1499  were involved in construction 1662  were office personnel and 1096  worked in mortgage and title operations we believe that we have good relations with our employees 

acquisitions 

we routinely evaluate opportunities to profitably expand our operations including potential acquisitions of other homebuilding or related businesses in august 2012  we acquired the homebuilding operations of breland homes which operates in huntsville and mobile alabama and along the coast of mississippi in october 2013  we acquired the homebuilding operations of regent homes inc which operates in charlotte greensboro and winstonsalem north carolina in may 2014  we acquired the homebuilding operations of crown communities which operates in georgia south carolina and eastern alabama 

acquisitions of homebuilding businesses can provide us with immediate land and home inventories as well as control of additional land and lot positions through option contracts in addition employees may have specialized knowledge of local market conditions including existing relationships with municipalities land owners developers subcontractors and suppliers these inventory positions and local market knowledge and relationships could take us several years to develop through our own startup efforts we seek to limit the risks associated with acquiring other companies by conducting extensive operational financial and legal due diligence on each acquisition and by performing financial analysis to determine that each acquisition will have a positive impact on our earnings within an acceptable period of time 

competition 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous other national regional and local homebuilders for homebuyers desirable properties raw materials skilled labor employees management talent and financing we also compete with resales of existing and foreclosed homes and with the rental housing market our homes compete on the basis of quality price design mortgage financing terms and location 

the competitors to our financial services businesses include other title companies and mortgage lenders including national regional and local mortgage bankers and other financial institutions some of these competitors are subject to fewer governmental regulations and have greater access to capital than we do and some of them may operate with different lending criteria and may offer a broader array of financing and other products and services to consumers than we do 

governmental regulation and environmental matters 

the homebuilding industry is subject to extensive and complex regulations we and the subcontractors we use must comply with many federal state and local laws and regulations including zoning density and development requirements building environmental advertising labor and real estate sales rules and regulations these regulations and requirements affect substantially all aspects of our land development and home design construction and sales processes in varying degrees across our markets our homes are inspected by local authorities where required and homes eligible for insurance or guarantees provided by the federal housing administration fha and the department of veteran affairs va are subject to inspection by them these regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities in addition our new housing developments may be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets utilities and other public improvements 

our homebuilding operations are also subject to an extensive variety of local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning protection of health safety and the environment the particular environmental laws for each site vary greatly according to location environmental condition and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties 

our mortgage company and title insurance agencies must comply with extensive federal and state laws and regulations as administered by numerous federal and state government agencies these include eligibility and other requirements for participation in the programs offered by the fha va government national mortgage association ginnie mae federal national mortgage association fannie mae federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac and the united states department of agriculture usda these laws and regulations also require compliance with consumer lending laws and other regulations governing disclosure requirements prohibitions against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures these laws and regulations subject our operations to regular extensive examinations by the applicable agencies 

seasonality 

although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again in the future we generally have more homes under construction close more homes and have greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year the seasonal activity increases our working capital requirements for our homebuilding operations during our third and fourth fiscal quarters and increases our funding requirements for the mortgages we originate in our financial services segment at the end of these quarters as a result of seasonal activity our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend 

discussion of our business and operations included in this annual report on form 10k should be read together with the risk factors set forth below they describe various risks and uncertainties we are or may become subject to many of which are difficult to predict or beyond our control these risks and uncertainties together with other factors described elsewhere in this report have the potential to affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner 

the homebuilding industry experienced a significant downturn from 2006 through 2011 homebuilding industry conditions began to improve in fiscal 2012 and we have begun to see improvements in the general us economy more recently however a subsequent deterioration in industry conditions or general economic conditions could adversely affect our business or financial results 

we experienced one of the most severe housing downturns in us history from 2006 through 2011 during this downturn we experienced significant reductions in our home sales and homebuilding revenues and we incurred substantial asset impairments and writeoffs since fiscal 2012 our results and other national data indicate that the overall demand for new homes has improved also more recently we have seen an improvement in us economic conditions however industry conditions vary across our operating markets and the mortgage lending environment remains restrictive weakening economic conditions and a deterioration in industry conditions could adversely affect our business and financial results 

the homebuilding industry is cyclical and affected by changes in economic real estate or other conditions that could adversely affect our business or financial results 

the homebuilding industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic and real estate conditions such as 

 

adverse changes in these general and local economic conditions or deterioration in the broader economy could have a negative impact on our business and financial results also changes in these economic conditions may affect some of our regions or markets more than others if adverse conditions affect any of our larger markets they could have a proportionately greater impact on us than on some other homebuilding companies 

in recent years concerns regarding the us government’s fiscal policies and economic stimulus actions have created uncertainty in the financial markets and caused volatility in interest rates which has impacted business and consumer confidence federal government actions related to economic stimulus taxation and spending levels borrowing limits potential government shutdowns the implementation of federal healthcare legislation and the related political debates conflicts and compromises associated with such actions may negatively impact the financial markets and consumer confidence and spending which could hurt the us economy and the housing market such events could adversely affect our homebuilding and financial services businesses and operating results 

weather conditions and natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes wildfires volcanic activity droughts and floods can harm our homebuilding business these can delay our development work home construction and home closings adversely affect the cost or availability of materials or labor or damage homes under construction the climates and geology of many of the states in which we operate including california florida texas and other coastal areas where we have some of our larger operations present increased risks of adverse weather or natural disasters 

deployments of us military personnel to foreign regions terrorist attacks other acts of violence or threats to national security and any corresponding response by the united states or others or related domestic or international instability may cause an economic slowdown in the markets where we operate which could adversely affect our homebuilding business 

public health issues such as a major epidemic or pandemic could adversely affect our business the us and other countries have experienced and may experience in the future outbreaks of contagious diseases that affect public perception of health risk in the event of a widespread prolonged actual or perceived outbreak of a contagious disease our operations could be negatively impacted by a reduction in customer traffic or other factors which could reduce demand for new homes 

if we experience any of the foregoing potential customers may be less willing or able to buy our homes in the future our pricing and product strategies may also be limited by market conditions we may be unable to change the mix of our home offerings reduce the costs of the homes we build offer more affordable homes or satisfactorily address changing market conditions in other ways without adversely affecting our profit margins in addition cancellations of home sales contracts in backlog may increase if homebuyers do not honor their contracts due to any of the factors discussed above 

our financial services business is closely related to our homebuilding business as it originates mortgage loans principally to purchasers of the homes we build a decrease in the demand for our homes because of the foregoing matters will also adversely affect the financial results of this segment of our business an increase in the default rate on the mortgages we originate may adversely affect our ability to sell the mortgages or the pricing we receive upon the sale of mortgages or may increase our recourse obligations for previous originations we establish reserves related to mortgages we have sold however actual future obligations related to these mortgages could differ significantly from our current estimated amounts 

constriction of the credit markets could limit our ability to access capital and increase our costs of capital 

during the housing downturn the credit markets constricted and reduced some sources of liquidity that were previously available to us consequently we focused on maintaining positive operating cash flow and we relied principally on our cash on hand to meet our working capital needs and repay outstanding indebtedness during those years there likely will be periods in the future when financial market upheaval will increase our cost of capital or limit our ability to access the public debt markets or obtain bank financing 

we have a revolving credit facility which currently provides committed loan financing through september 7 2019  in an amount totaling 975 million  also our mortgage subsidiary utilizes a 300 million  mortgage repurchase facility to finance the majority of the loans it originates the capacity of the facility can be increased up to 400 million  subject to the availability of additional commitments the mortgage repurchase facility must be renewed annually and currently expires on february 27 2015  we expect to renew and extend the term of the mortgage repurchase facility with similar terms prior to its maturity adverse changes in market conditions could make the renewal of these facilities more difficult or could result in an increase in the cost of the facilities or a decrease in the committed amounts such changes affecting our mortgage repurchase facility may also make it more difficult or costly to sell the mortgages that we originate 

we believe that our existing cash resources our revolving credit facility and our mortgage repurchase facility provide sufficient liquidity to fund our nearterm working capital needs and debt obligations we regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund future growth in our business repay our longerterm debt obligations and support our other general corporate and operational needs and we regularly evaluate our opportunities to raise additional capital as market conditions permit we may issue new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets or obtain additional bank financing to fund our projected capital requirements or provide additional liquidity adverse changes in economic homebuilding or capital market conditions could negatively affect our business liquidity and financial results 

reductions in the availability of mortgage financing and the liquidity provided by governmentsponsored enterprises the effects of government programs a decrease in our ability to sell mortgage loans on attractive terms or an increase in mortgage interest rates could adversely affect our business or financial results 

since the housing downturn the mortgage lending industry has experienced significant change and contraction credit requirements have tightened and investor demand for mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities has been predominantly limited to securities backed by fannie mae freddie mac or ginnie mae as a result it remains difficult for some potential buyers to finance their home purchases further tightening of credit requirements could adversely affect our business or financial results 

we believe that the liquidity provided by fannie mae freddie mac and ginnie mae to the mortgage industry has been very important to the housing market fannie mae and freddie mac have required substantial injections of capital from the federal government and may require additional government support in the future there has been ongoing discussion by the government with regard to the long term structure and viability of fannie mae and freddie mac these discussions include the downsizing of their portfolios as well as the tightening of guidelines for their loan products in addition increased lending volume and losses insured by the fha have resulted in a reduction of its insurance fund any reduction in the availability of the financing or insuring provided by these institutions could adversely affect interest rates mortgage availability and sales of new homes and mortgage loans the fha insures mortgage loans that generally have lower credit requirements and is an important source for financing the sale of our homes in recent years more restrictive guidelines have been placed on fha insured loans affecting minimum down payment and availability for condominium financing also in recent years the fha has raised the premium charged to borrowers for insuring loans which has increased the cost of fha financing additional future restrictions or premium increases may negatively affect the availability or affordability of fha financing which could adversely affect our ability to sell homes 

while the use of down payment assistance programs by our homebuyers has decreased significantly some of our customers still utilize 100 financing through programs offered by the va and united states department of agriculture usda these governmentsponsored loan programs are subject to changes in regulations lending standards and government funding levels there can be no assurances that these programs or other programs will continue to be available in our homebuilding markets or that they will be as attractive to our customers as the programs currently offered which could negatively affect our sales 

the mortgage loans originated by our financial services operations are generally sold to thirdparty purchasers during fiscal 2014  approximately 71  of our mortgage loans were sold to four  major financial institutions and the largest concentration of total loans sold to one institution was 28  on an ongoing basis we seek to establish loan purchase arrangements with multiple institutions if we are unable to sell mortgage loans to purchasers on attractive terms our ability to originate and sell mortgage loans at competitive prices could be limited which would negatively affect our profitability 

even if potential customers do not need financing changes in the availability of mortgage products may make it more difficult for them to sell their current homes to potential buyers who need financing 

mortgage rates are currently low as compared to most historical periods if interest rates increase the costs of owning a home will be affected which could result in a decline in the demand for our homes 

the risks associated with our land and lot inventory could adversely affect our business or financial results 

inventory risks are substantial for our homebuilding business there are risks inherent in controlling owning and developing land if housing demand declines we may not be able to build and sell homes profitably in some of our communities and we may not be able to fully recover the costs of some of the land and lots we own also the values of our owned undeveloped land building lots and housing inventories may fluctuate significantly due to changes in market conditions as a result our deposits for lots controlled under option or similar contracts may be put at risk we may have to sell homes or land for a lower profit margin or we may have to record inventory impairment charges on our developed and undeveloped land and lots a significant deterioration in economic or homebuilding industry conditions may result in substantial inventory impairment charges 

homebuilding is subject to home warranty and construction defect claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant 

we are subject to home warranty and construction defect claims arising in the ordinary course of our homebuilding business we rely on subcontractors to perform the actual construction of our homes and in many cases to select and obtain construction materials despite our detailed specifications and monitoring of the construction process our subcontractors occasionally use improper construction processes or defective materials in the construction of our homes when we find these issues we repair them in accordance with our warranty obligations we spend significant resources to repair items in homes we have sold to fulfill the warranties we issued to our homebuyers additionally we are subject to construction defect claims which can be costly to defend and resolve in the legal system warranty and construction defect matters can also result in negative publicity in the media and on the internet which can damage our reputation and adversely affect our ability to sell homes 

based on the large number of homes we have sold over the years our potential liabilities related to warranty and construction defect claims are significant as a consequence we maintain product liability insurance and we seek to obtain indemnities and certificates of insurance from subcontractors covering claims related to their workmanship and materials we establish warranty and other reserves for the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built because of the uncertainties inherent to these matters we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will be adequate to address all of our future warranty and construction defect claims contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce we may be responsible for applicable selfinsured retentions and some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits additionally the coverage offered by and the availability of product liability insurance for construction defects is limited and costly we have responded to increases in insurance costs and coverage limitations by increasing our selfinsured retentions and claim reserves there can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted or become more costly if costs to resolve our future warranty and construction defect claims exceed our estimates our financial results and liquidity could be adversely affected 

supply shortages and other risks related to acquiring land building materials and skilled labor could increase our costs and delay deliveries 

the homebuilding industry has from time to time experienced significant difficulties that can affect the cost or timing of construction including 

 

these factors may cause us to take longer or incur more costs to build our homes and adversely affect our revenues and margins if the level of new home demand increases significantly in future periods the risk of shortages in residential lots labor and materials available to the homebuilding industry could increase in some markets where we operate 

we are required to obtain performance bonds the unavailability of which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

we often are required to provide surety bonds to secure our performance or obligations under construction contracts development agreements and other arrangements our ability to obtain surety bonds primarily depends upon our credit rating financial condition past performance and other factors including the capacity of the surety market and the underwriting practices of surety bond issuers the ability to obtain surety bonds also can be impacted by the willingness of insurance companies to issue performance bonds for construction and development activities if we are unable to obtain surety bonds when required our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

increases in the costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business or financial results 

significant expenses of owning a home including mortgage interest and real estate taxes generally are deductible expenses for an individual’s federal and in some cases state income taxes subject to various limitations under current tax law and policy if the federal government or a state government changes its income tax laws as has been discussed from time to time to eliminate or substantially modify these income tax deductions the aftertax cost of owning a new home would increase for many of our potential customers the loss or reduction of homeowner tax deductions if such tax law changes were enacted without offsetting provisions could adversely affect demand for and sales prices of new homes 

in addition increases in property tax rates by local governmental authorities as experienced in some areas in response to reduced federal and state funding could adversely affect the amount of financing our potential customers could obtain or their desire to purchase new homes 

our business and financial results could be adversely affected by significant inflation higher interest rates or deflation 

inflation can adversely affect us by increasing costs of land materials and labor in addition significant inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates which have a negative impact on housing demand in a highly inflationary environment depending on industry and other economic conditions we may be precluded from raising home prices enough to keep up with the rate of inflation which could reduce our profit margins moreover with inflation the costs of capital increase and the purchasing power of our cash resources can decline current or future efforts by the government to stimulate the economy may increase the risk of significant inflation and its adverse impact on our business or financial results 

alternatively a significant period of deflation could cause a decrease in overall spending and borrowing levels this could lead to a further deterioration in economic conditions including an increase in the rate of unemployment deflation could also cause the value of our inventories to decline or reduce the value of existing homes below the related mortgage loan balance which could potentially increase the supply of existing homes and have a negative impact on our results of operations 

governmental regulations and environmental matters could increase the cost and limit the availability of our development and homebuilding projects and adversely affect our business or financial results 

we are subject to extensive and complex regulations that affect land development and home construction including zoning density restrictions building design and building standards these regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities as to the conditions we must meet prior to development or construction being approved if approved at all we are subject to determinations by these authorities as to the adequacy of water or sewage facilities roads or other local services new housing developments may also be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets and other public improvements in addition in many markets government authorities have implemented no growth or growth control initiatives any of these can limit delay or increase the costs of development or home construction 

we are also subject to a significant number and variety of local state and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of health safety labor standards and the environment the impact of environmental laws varies depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available these matters may result in delays may cause us to incur substantial compliance remediation mitigation and other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas government agencies also routinely initiate audits reviews or investigations of our business practices to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations which can cause us to incur costs or create other disruptions in our business that can be significant 

the subcontractors we rely on to perform the actual construction of our homes are also subject to a significant number of local state and federal laws and regulations including laws involving matters that are not within our control if the subcontractors who construct our homes fail to comply with all applicable laws we can suffer reputational damage and may be exposed to possible liability 

we are also subject to an extensive number of laws and regulations because our common stock and debt securities are publicly traded in the capital markets these regulations govern our communications with our shareholders and the capital markets our financial statement disclosures and our legal processes and they also impact the work required to be performed by our independent registered public accounting firm and our legal counsel changes in these laws and regulations including the subsequent implementation of rules by the administering government authorities can require us to incur additional compliance costs and such costs can be significant 

governmental regulation of our financial services operations could adversely affect our business or financial results 

our financial services operations are subject to a significant number of federal state and local laws and regulations any of which may limit our ability to provide mortgage financing or title services to potential purchasers of our homes these include eligibility requirements for participation in federal loan programs compliance with consumer lending laws and other regulations governing disclosure requirements prohibitions against discrimination real estate settlement procedures and foreclosure and servicing policies additionally the turmoil caused by the significant number of defaults and resulting foreclosures during the housing downturn has encouraged consumer lawsuits and the investigation of financial services industry practices by various governmental authorities these governmental inquiries could result in changes in regulations and in the practices of the financial services and homebuilding industries and they could adversely affect the costs and financial results of financial services and homebuilding companies 

in july 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act was enacted providing for a number of new requirements related to residential mortgage lending practices in 2011 the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb was created to regulate consumer protection with regard to financial products and services in january 2014 the cfpb implemented rules regarding the creation and definition of a “qualified mortgage” qm these rules created standards for lender practices regarding assessing borrowers’ ability to repay and limitations on certain fees and incentive arrangements additional rules regarding loan estimates closing disclosures and fees are scheduled to be implemented in august 2015 the effect of these rules on our homebuilding and financial services businesses have yet to be determined and could affect the availability and cost of mortgage credit 

we have substantial amounts of consolidated debt and may incur additional debt our debt obligations and our ability to comply with related covenants restrictions or limitations could adversely affect our financial condition 

as of september 30 2014  our consolidated debt was 37 billion  and we had 5224 million  principal amount of our debt maturing before the end of fiscal 2015  the indentures governing our senior notes do not restrict the incurrence of future unsecured debt by us or our homebuilding subsidiaries or the incurrence of secured or unsecured debt by our financial services subsidiaries and the agreement governing our revolving credit facility and our senior note indentures allow us to incur a substantial amount of future unsecured debt such instruments also permit us and our homebuilding subsidiaries to incur significant amounts of additional secured debt 

possible consequences the amount and the maturities of our debt could have important consequences for example they could 

 

in addition the magnitude of our debt and the restrictions imposed by the instruments governing these obligations expose us to additional risks including 

dependence on future performance our ability to meet our debt service and other obligations and the financial covenants under our revolving credit and mortgage repurchase facilities will depend in part upon our future financial performance our future results are subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report our revenues and earnings vary with the level of general economic activity in the markets we serve our businesses are also affected by financial political business and other factors many of which are beyond our control the factors that affect our ability to generate cash can also affect our ability to raise additional funds for these purposes through the sale of debt or equity the refinancing of debt or the sale of assets changes in prevailing interest rates may affect our ability to meet our debt service obligations because borrowings under our revolving credit facility and mortgage repurchase facility bear interest at floating rates 

revolving credit facility our revolving credit facility contains financial covenants requiring the maintenance of a minimum level of tangible net worth a maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and a borrowing base restriction if our ratio of debt to tangible net worth exceeds a certain level a failure to comply with these requirements could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under our revolving credit facility or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity the agreement governing our revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our senior notes impose restrictions on the ability of the company and the guarantors to incur debt secured by certain assets 

mortgage repurchase facility and other restrictions the mortgage repurchase facility for our mortgage subsidiary requires the maintenance of a minimum level of tangible net worth a maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and a minimum level of liquidity by our mortgage subsidiary a failure to comply with these requirements could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds to our mortgage subsidiary or cause their debt to become due and payable prior to maturity any difficulty experienced in complying with these covenants could make the renewal of the facility more difficult or costly 

in addition although our financial services business is conducted through subsidiaries that are not restricted by our indentures or revolving credit facility the ability of our financial services subsidiaries to provide funds to our homebuilding operations would be restricted in the event such distribution of funds would cause an event of default under the mortgage repurchase facility or if an event of default had occurred under this facility moreover our right to receive assets from these subsidiaries upon their liquidation or recapitalization will be subject to the prior claims of the creditors of these subsidiaries any claims we may have to funds from our financial services subsidiaries would be subordinate to subsidiary indebtedness to the extent of any security for such indebtedness and to any indebtedness otherwise recognized as senior to our claims 

changes in debt ratings our senior unsecured debt is currently rated below investment grade any lowering of our debt ratings could make accessing the public capital markets or obtaining additional credit from banks more difficult andor more expensive 

change of control purchase options and change of control default  upon the occurrence of both a change of control and a ratings downgrade event each as defined in the indentures governing 23 billion  principal amount of our senior notes as of september 30 2014  we will be required to offer to repurchase such notes at 101  of their principal amount together with all accrued and unpaid interest if any moreover a change of control as defined in our revolving credit facility would constitute an event of default under our revolving credit facility which could result in the acceleration of the repayment of any borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility a requirement to cash collateralize all letters of credit outstanding thereunder and the termination of the commitments thereunder if repayment of more than 50 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility was accelerated and such acceleration was not rescinded or such indebtedness was not satisfied in either case within 30 days an event of default would result under the indentures governing our senior notes entitling the trustee for the notes or holders of at least 25 percent in principal amount of the relevant series of notes then outstanding to declare all such notes to be due and payable immediately if repayment of the borrowings under our revolving credit facility or of our senior notes was accelerated we can give no assurance that we would have sufficient funds to pay the amounts owed 

homebuilding and financial services are very competitive industries and competitive conditions could adversely affect our business or financial results 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive homebuilders compete not only for homebuyers but also for desirable properties financing raw materials and skilled labor we compete with local regional and national homebuilders often within larger subdivisions designed planned and developed by such homebuilders we also compete with existing home sales foreclosures and rental properties the competitive conditions in the homebuilding industry can negatively affect our sales volumes selling prices and incentive levels reduce our profit margins and cause impairments in the value of our inventory or other assets competition can also affect our ability to acquire suitable land raw materials and skilled labor at acceptable prices or terms or cause delays in the construction of our homes 

the competitors to our financial services businesses include other title companies and mortgage lenders including national regional and local mortgage bankers and other financial institutions some of these competitors are subject to fewer governmental regulations and have greater access to capital than we do and some of them may operate with different lending criteria than we do these competitors may offer a broader or more attractive array of financing and other products and services to potential customers than we do 

our homebuilding and financial services businesses compete with other companies across all industries to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced employees managers and executives competition for the services of these individuals will likely increase as business conditions improve in the homebuilding and financial services industries or in the general economy if we are unable to attract and retain key employees managers or executives our business could be adversely affected 

we cannot make any assurances that our growth strategies or acquisitions will be successful or not expose us to additional risks 

we have primarily focused on internal growth in recent years by increasing our investments in land lot and home inventories in our existing homebuilding markets we have also expanded our business through selected investments in new geographic markets investments in land lots and home inventories can expose us to risks of economic loss and inventory impairments if housing conditions weaken or if we are unsuccessful in implementing our growth strategies 

additionally we acquired the homebuilding operations of one company in fiscal 2012 and two companies in fiscal 2014 and we may make strategic acquisitions of other companies or their assets in the future such acquisitions have similar risks as our other investments in land lots and home inventories but they also require the integration of the acquired operations and management we can give no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify acquire and integrate strategic acquisitions in the future acquisitions can result in dilution to existing stockholders if we issue our common stock as consideration or reduce our liquidity or increase our debt if we fund them with cash in addition acquisitions can expose us to valuation risks including the risk of writing off goodwill or impairing inventory and other assets related to such acquisitions the risk of goodwill and asset impairments increases during a cyclical housing downturn when our profitability may decline as evidenced by the goodwill and asset impairment charges we recognized during the most recent downturn 

our deferred income tax assets may not be fully realizable 

as of september 30 2014  we had deferred income tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities of 5961 million  against which we provided a valuation allowance of 311 million  the realization of all or a portion of our deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the statutory carryforward periods and in the jurisdictions in which the related temporary differences become deductible we have provided a valuation allowance against a portion of our net deferred income tax assets because it is more likely than not that a portion of our state net operating loss nol carryforwards will not be realized because the nol carryforward periods in some states are too brief to realize the related deferred tax assets the accounting for deferred income taxes is based upon estimates of future results a housing industry downturn or other adverse situations that negatively affect our future taxable income could result in the need for us to record a larger valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position changes in tax laws also affect actual tax results and the valuation of deferred income tax assets specifically a decrease in income tax rates would result in a decrease in our deferred tax assets and a corresponding charge to income tax expense 

our business could be adversely affected by the loss of key personnel 

we rely on our key personnel to effectively operate and manage our homebuilding and financial services businesses specifically our success depends heavily on the performance of our homebuilding division and region presidents and their management teams our financial services management team our corporate office management teams and our executive officers these key personnel have significant experience and skills in the homebuilding and financial services industries as well as leadership and management abilities that are important to our success effective september 30 2014 our president and chief executive officer ceo retired and our chief operating officer was named as successor effective october 1 2014 our former ceo will provide consulting services to us for three years under a consulting agreement we seek to have succession plans for events such as this retirement when we lose the services of our key personnel however if we lose the services of key personnel and our succession planning and implementation efforts are unsuccessful our business could be adversely affected 

negative publicity could adversely affect our reputation as well as our business financial results and stock price 

unfavorable media related to our industry company brands marketing personnel operations business performance or prospects may affect our stock price and the performance of our business regardless of its accuracy or inaccuracy the speed at which negative publicity can be disseminated has increased dramatically with the capabilities of electronic communication including social media outlets websites blogs or newsletters our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to this rapidly changing media environment adverse publicity or negative commentary from any media outlets could damage our reputation and reduce the demand for our homes which would adversely affect our business 

information technology failures and data security breaches could harm our business 

we use information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational and marketing activities and to maintain our business records these information technology systems are dependent upon global communications providers web browsers telephone systems and other aspects of the internet infrastructure that have experienced security breaches cyberattacks significant systems failures and electrical outages in the past a material breach in the security of our information technology systems or other data security controls could include the theft or release of customer employee or company data in february 2012 we experienced a software security breach by unknown external sources in our internet loan prequalification system we investigated the breach with the assistance of information technology security experts and with local and federal law enforcement our investigations produced no evidence that any of our customers’ data was actually accessed or exported from our systems a security breach such as the one we experienced a significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems or a breach of any of our data security controls could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers adversely impact our sales and revenue and require us to incur significant expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve these kinds of issues the release of confidential information as a result of a security breach may also lead to litigation or other proceedings against us by affected individuals or business partners or by regulators and the outcome of such proceedings which could include penalties or fines could have a significant negative impact on our business we may also be required to incur significant costs to protect against damages caused by these information technology failures or security breaches in the future we routinely utilize information technology security experts to assist us in our evaluations of the effectiveness of the security of our information technology systems and we regularly enhance our security measures to protect our systems and data however we cannot provide assurances that a security breach cyberattack data theft or other significant systems or security failures will not occur in the future and such occurrences could have a material and adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position

results of operations — fiscal year 2014  overview 

during fiscal 2014 demand for new homes reflected stable to moderately improved trends across most of our operating markets the significant increases in new home prices that occurred in many markets during fiscal 2013 moderated during fiscal 2014 as new home prices became less affordable to some buyers and as the supply of new homes increased while most of our operating markets are relatively stable we see varying levels of strength in new home demand and home prices across our markets with demand in each market generally reflecting the relative strength of each market’s economy as measured by job growth household incomes household formations and consumer confidence 

our position as the largest and most geographically diverse builder in the united states provides a strong platform for us to compete for new home sales over the past two years we significantly increased our land lot and home inventories by 35 billion  across our markets while maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity position in fiscal 2013 we introduced our emerald homes brand to expand our product offerings to include more moveup and luxury homes in fiscal 2014 we introduced our express homes brand to offer more affordable homes for entrylevel buyers who we believe have been underserved in the new home market recently both of these new offerings are being introduced across our operating markets over the next year which will significantly broaden our product diversity 

in fiscal 2014  the number and value of our net sales orders increased   18  and 27  respectively compared to the prior year and the number of homes closed and home sales revenues increased   19  and 30  respectively we generated pretax income of 8142 million  in fiscal 2014  compared to 6578 million  in fiscal 2013  and 2429 million  in fiscal 2012  these results reflect the improved housing market conditions over the past two years and strong performance from our homebuilding and financial services operations we believe our business is wellpositioned to continue to grow profitably due to our broad geographic operating base and product offerings our increased inventory position of finished lots land and homes and our strong balance sheet and liquidity we are focused on operating each of our communities to optimize the returns on our inventory investments by effectively managing our product offerings home prices incentives sales pace profit margins and inventory levels 

we believe that housing demand in our individual operating markets is tied closely to each market’s economy therefore we expect that housing market conditions will vary across our markets the us economy continues to slowly improve which we expect will allow slow to moderate overall growth in housing demand concentrated in markets where job growth is occurring the pace and sustainability of new home demand and our future results could be negatively affected by weakening economic conditions decreases in the level of employment and housing demand decreased home affordability significant increases in mortgage interest rates or tightening of mortgage lending standards 

strategy 

during fiscal 2014 demand for new homes has been relatively stable across most of our operating markets with varying levels of strength in demand and home prices across our individual markets based on local economic conditions we have used our liquidity and balance sheet flexibility to provide the capital to increase our investments in housing and land inventory expand our product offerings geographically expand our operations and opportunistically pursue business acquisitions our operating strategy is focused on leveraging our strong financial and competitive position to generate strong profitability improve cash flows and increase our returns on our inventory investments our operating strategy includes the following initiatives 

 

our operating strategy has produced positive results in recent years and in fiscal 2014  however we cannot provide any assurances that the initiatives listed above will continue to be successful and we may need to adjust components of our strategy to meet future market conditions we expect that our operating strategy will allow us to increase our profitability while maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity position in fiscal 2015  

key results 

key financial results as of and for our fiscal year ended september 30 2014  as compared to fiscal 2013  were as follows

consolidated results 

 

results of operations — homebuilding 

our operating segments are our 37  homebuilding operating divisions which we aggregate into six  reporting segments these reporting segments which we also refer to as reporting regions have homebuilding operations located in the following states 



fiscal year ended september 30 2014  compared to fiscal year ended september 30 2013   

the following tables and related discussion set forth key operating and financial data for our homebuilding operations by reporting segment as of and for the fiscal years ended september 30 2014  and 2013  





 

 

net sales orders 

the value of net sales orders increased   27  to 83086 million   29709  homes in 2014  from 65670 million   25120  homes in 2013  with significant increases in four of our six regions the increases in sales order value in those regions were primarily due to increases in volume as we have expanded our operations and increased our market share in many of our markets over the past year to a lesser extent and to varying degrees increases in selling prices also contributed to the value of net sales orders in each region 

the number of net sales orders increased   18  and the average price of our net sales orders increased   7  to 279700  during 2014  compared to 2013  the largest percentage increase in net sales orders occurred in our east region reflecting the positive impact of our recent acquisitions of the homebuilding operations of regent homes and crown communities which contributed 714  net sales orders to the east region in 2014  crown communities also contributed 508  net sales orders to the southeast region in 2014  the decreases in net sales orders that occurred in our midwest and southwest regions were primarily due to decreases in sales orders in our minnesota colorado phoenix and albuquerque markets we believe our business is well positioned for the future however our future sales volumes will depend on the economic strength of each of our operating markets and our ability to successfully implement our operating strategies in each market 



sales order backlog 

sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies including mortgage loan approval and buyers selling their existing homes which can result in cancellations a portion of the contracts in backlog will not result in closings due to cancellations the largest percentage increase in our sales order backlog occurred in our east region reflecting the positive impact of our recent acquisitions of the homebuilding operations of regent homes and crown communities which contributed 377  homes to our east region backlog at september 30 2014  crown communities also contributed 305  homes to our southeast region backlog at september 30 2014  



home sales revenue 

revenues from home sales increased 30  to 78047 million   28670  homes closed in 2014  from 60248 million   24155  homes closed in 2013  during the current year home sales revenues increased in most of our regions as we have expanded our operations and increased our market share in many of our markets 

the number of homes closed in fiscal 2014   increased   19  from 2013  due to increases in four of our six regions the most significant percentage increase occurred in our east region reflecting the positive impact of our recent acquisitions of the homebuilding operations of regent homes and crown communities which contributed 676  closings to the east region in 2014  crown communities also contributed 508  closings to the southeast region in 2014  excluding the impact of crown communities the increase in homes closed in our southeast region was primarily due to increases in our jacksonville and atlanta markets in our south central region the highest percentage increases in homes closed occurred in our fort worth dallas and houston markets the increase in our west region was primarily due to increases in our bay area portland and sacramento markets the decrease in home closings in our southwest region was primarily due to weak demand in the phoenix market compared to a year ago and in our midwest region the decrease was attributable to our colorado and chicago markets 

the average selling price of homes closed during 2014  was 272200  up   9  from the 249400  average in 2013  the level of home price increases began to moderate during fiscal 2014 a trend we expect will continue in future periods we are focused on managing our product offerings home prices incentives sales pace profit margins and inventory levels in each community in a manner that will optimize the returns on our inventory investments 

homebuilding operating margin analysis 



home sales gross profit 

gross profit from home sales increased   33  to 17 billion  in 2014  from 13 billion in 2013  and increased   50 basis points to 213  as a percentage of home sales revenues approximately 40  basis points of the increase in the home sales gross profit percentage resulted from the average selling price of our homes closed increasing by more than the average home cost 20  basis points of the increase resulted from a decrease in the amortization of capitalized interest and property taxes as a percentage of homes sales revenues and 10  basis points of the increase resulted from lower costs for warranty and construction defect claims as a percentage of home sales revenue partially offsetting these increases was a 20  basis point decrease from purchase accounting adjustments related to the acquisitions of crown communities and regent homes 

our gross profit margins during fiscal 2013 and throughout the first half of fiscal 2014 benefited significantly from favorable market conditions that allowed us to increase sales prices across most of our markets while we limited increases in construction costs our gross profit margins also benefited from reduced interest amortized to cost of sales as our average borrowing costs declined the increases in our average sales prices moderated in the second half of fiscal 2014 and we expect future price increases will continue to moderate while our construction costs will likely increase also we have and will continue to manage the sales pace in each of our communities by adjusting the pricing incentives and product mix to optimize the returns on our inventory investments these factors caused our gross profit margins in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2014 to decline as compared to the prior year quarters and to the first two quarters of fiscal 2014 gross profit margins in future periods could be lower than fiscal 2014 levels 

land sales and other revenues 

land sales and other revenues were 538 million  in fiscal 2014  compared to 611 million  in 2013  we generally purchase land and lots with the intent to build and sell homes on them however we occasionally purchase land that includes commercially zoned parcels that we typically sell to commercial developers and we may also sell residential lots or land parcels to manage our land and lot supply land and lot sales occur at unpredictable intervals and varying degrees of profitability therefore the revenues and gross profit from land sales fluctuate from period to period revenues in fiscal 2013  included revenue of 200 million  from a longterm construction project for which we served as the general contractor as of september 30 2014  we had 264 million  of land held for sale that we expect to sell in the next twelve months 

inventory and land option charges 

during fiscal 2014  we reviewed the performance and outlook for all of our land inventories and communities each quarter for indicators of potential impairment and performed detailed impairment evaluations and analyses when necessary as of september 30 2014  we performed detailed impairment evaluations of communities with a combined carrying value of 3598 million  and we recorded impairment charges of 181 million  during the fourth quarter to reduce the carrying value of impaired communities to their estimated fair value total impairment charges during fiscal 2014  and 2013  were 752 million  and 213 million  respectively 

of the total impairment charges in fiscal 2014  493 million  occurred in our midwest region primarily related to communities in chicago that were purchased predominantly in 2004 through 2007 and had been previously impaired during the third quarter of fiscal 2014 we reduced home prices and identified land parcels we intend to sell in these chicago communities in an effort to increase sales pace reduce inventories and improve cash flows and returns in contrast to most of our markets the chicago housing market remains weak with sales absorptions and returns in these communities performing below our expectations given the size of our investments 

also during fiscal 2014  177 million  of impairment charges occurred in our east region these impairments primarily related to longheld inactive and underperforming projects in the suburban washington dc market that we intend to sell to reduce inventories and improve cash flows and returns 

as we manage our inventory investments across our operating markets to optimize returns and cash flows we may modify our pricing and incentives construction and development plans or land sale strategies in individual active communities and land held for development which could result in the affected communities being evaluated for potential impairment also if housing or economic conditions are weak in specific markets in which we operate or if conditions weaken in the broader economy or homebuilding industry we may be required to evaluate additional communities for potential impairment these evaluations could result in additional impairment charges 

during fiscal 2014  and 2013  we wrote off 100 million  and 98 million  respectively of earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs related to land option contracts that are expected to be terminated at september 30 2014  outstanding earnest money deposits associated with our portfolio of land and lot option purchase contracts totaled 587 million  

selling general and administrative sga expense 

sga expense from homebuilding activities increased   28  to 8342 million  in 2014  from 6499 million  in 2013  as a percentage of homebuilding revenues sga expense decreased   10 basis points to 106  in 2014  from 107  in 2013  

employee compensation and related costs represented 64  and 65  of sga costs in 2014  and 2013  respectively these costs increased  by 26  to 5369 million  in 2014  from 4252 million  in 2013  mainly due to an increase in our number of employees and an increase in incentive compensation related to the increase in profitability in many of our divisions in the current year as compared to the prior year our homebuilding operations employed approximately 4525  and 3600 employees at september 30 2014  and 2013  respectively 

variances in our homebuilding sga expense as a percentage of revenues can occur due to fluctuations in revenue profit levels and our stock price our awards of performance based units to executive management are accounted for as liability awards and are measured quarterly with changes in value recorded in compensation expense within sga changes in our stock price and our performance compared to our peer group can cause significant changes in the value of these awards and in our compensation expense compensation expense related to these liability awards was 91 million  and 88 million  during fiscal 2014  and 2013  respectively 

we attempt to control our sga costs while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports our operations however we cannot make assurances that we will be able to maintain or improve upon the current sga expense as a percentage of revenues 

interest incurred 

comparing fiscal 2014  with 2013  interest incurred increased   8  to 1858 million  due to an 18   increase  in our average debt interest incurred in the current year increased by a lower percentage than the increase in our average debt as a result of a decrease in the average interest rate of our debt as compared to the prior year 

we capitalize interest costs incurred to inventory during active development and construction active inventory capitalized interest is charged to cost of sales as the related inventory is delivered to the buyer during a portion of fiscal 2013 our active inventory was lower than our debt level and therefore a portion of the interest incurred was reflected as interest expense however since the third quarter of fiscal 2013 our active inventory has exceeded our debt level and all interest incurred has been capitalized to inventory as a result no  interest was expensed during fiscal 2014  compared to 71 million  during 2013  interest amortized to cost of sales declined  to 20  of total home and landlot and other cost of sales in fiscal 2014  from 23  in fiscal 2013  due to the growth in our active inventory relative to our debt balance and a decrease in the average interest rate on our outstanding debt we do not expect interest amortized to cost of sales as a percentage of total home and landlot cost of sales to decline as significantly in future periods 

other income 

other income net of other expenses included in our homebuilding operations was 131 million  in fiscal 2014  compared to 149 million  in 2013  other income consists of interest income rental income income from insurance related activities income associated with other incomeproducing assets and various other types of ancillary income gains expenses and losses not directly associated with our core homebuilding operations the activities that result in this ancillary income or loss are not significant either individually or in the aggregate 

acquisitions 

in october 2013  we acquired the homebuilding operations of regent homes inc for 345 million  in cash regent homes operates in charlotte greensboro and winstonsalem north carolina the assets acquired included approximately 240  homes in inventory 300  lots and control of approximately 600  additional lots through option contracts we also acquired a sales order backlog of 213  homes valued at 311 million  subsequent to the acquisition regent homes closed 463  homes and generated home sales revenues of 694 million  during fiscal 2014  

in may 2014  we acquired the homebuilding operations of crown communities for 2096 million  in cash crown communities operates in georgia south carolina and eastern alabama the assets acquired included approximately 640  homes in inventory 2350  lots and control of approximately 3400  additional lots through option contracts we also acquired a sales order backlog of 431  homes valued at 1136 million  subsequent to the acquisition crown communities closed 721  homes and generated home sales revenues of 1877 million  during fiscal 2014  

homebuilding results by reporting region 



 

 

east region  — homebuilding revenues increased   39  in 2014  compared to 2013  primarily due to an increase in the number of homes closed in our charlotte market due to our acquisition of regent homes in october 2013  which added 463  closings to the fiscal 2014  results the region also benefited from our acquisition of crown communities in may 2014  which added 213  closings to the regions fiscal 2014  results the region generated pretax income of 452 million  in 2014  compared to 483 million  in 2013  fiscal 2014  pretax income was reduced by inventory impairment charges of 177 million  primarily in our suburban washington dc market gross profit from home sales as a percentage of home sales revenue home sales gross profit percentage decreased   120  basis points in fiscal 2014  compared to fiscal 2013  largely due to purchase accounting adjustments for the two acquisitions as a percentage of homebuilding revenues sga expenses decreased  by 70  basis points in 2014  due to the increase in revenues

inventories land and lot position and homes in inventory

financial services operating margin analysis 



 

 

mortgage loan activity 

the volume of loans originated and brokered by our mortgage operations is related to the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations in fiscal 2014  the volume of firstlien loans originated or brokered by dhi mortgage for our homebuyers increased  by 5  while the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations increased  by 19  this was due to a decrease in our mortgage capture rate the percentage of total home closings by our homebuilding operations for which dhi mortgage handled the homebuyers’ financing to 50  in fiscal 2014  from 56  in fiscal 2013  the decrease in capture rate was due to an increase in home closings in markets not served by dhi mortgage as well as a more competitive mortgage pricing market as compared to the prior year 

home loans to customers of our homebuilding operations constituted 88  of dhi mortgage loan originations in 2014  compared to 86  in 2013  these rates reflect dhi mortgage’s consistent focus on the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations 

the number of loans sold in 2014   increased  slightly from the number sold in 2013  virtually all of the mortgage loans originated during fiscal 2014  and mortgage loans held for sale on september 30 2014  were eligible for sale to the fannie mae freddie mac or ginnie mae approximately 71  of the mortgage loans sold by dhi mortgage during fiscal 2014  were sold to four  major financial institutions and the largest concentration of total loans sold to one institution was 28  

financial services revenues and expenses 

revenues from the financial services segment decreased   4  to 1664 million  in fiscal 2014  from 1734 million  in fiscal 2013  the volume of loans sold increased   1  while revenues from the sale of servicing rights and gains from sale of mortgages decreased   11  although loan sale volume was essentially unchanged loan sale revenue decreased from fiscal 2013 due to pricing pressure from increased competition in the origination marketplace in addition loan sale execution in the prior year was unusually strong due in part to the lower interest rate environment at the time 

we had a credit of 22 million  related to a reduction in our estimated future recourse obligations in fiscal 2014  compared to a charge of 05 million  in fiscal 2013  related to an increase in our estimated future recourse obligations our loss reserve for loan recourse obligations is estimated based upon an analysis of loan repurchase requests received our actual repurchases and losses through the disposition of such loans or requests discussions with our mortgage purchasers and analysis of the mortgages we originated while we believe that we have adequately reserved for losses on known and projected repurchase requests if actual repurchase volume or actual losses incurred resolving those repurchases differ from our expectations additional recourse expense or credits may be incurred 

financial services general and administrative ga expense increased   13  to 1312 million  in 2014  from 1164 million  in 2013  as a percentage of financial services revenues excluding the effects of recourse and reinsurance expense ga expense was 798  in 2014  compared to 669  in 2013  due to an increase in the number of employees to ensure adequate staffing for expected higher volumes of loan originations from the growth in our homebuilding operations and compliance with new regulatory requirements fluctuations in financial services ga expense as a percentage of revenues can be expected to occur as some components of revenue may fluctuate differently than loan volumes and some expenses are not directly related to mortgage loan volume or to changes in the amount of revenue earned 

results of operations — consolidated 

fiscal year ended september 30 2014  compared to fiscal year ended september 30 2013 

income before income taxes 

pretax income for fiscal 2014  was 8142 million  compared to 6578 million  for fiscal 2013  the increase in our operating income for the current year compared to a year ago is primarily due to higher revenues and home sales gross profits from increased home closings 

income taxes 

our income tax expense in fiscal 2014  was 2807 million  compared to 1951 million  in 2013  our effective tax rate was 345  in fiscal 2014  compared to 297  in fiscal 2013  the effective tax rate for fiscal 2014  includes a tax benefit for the domestic production activities deduction and a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits and the related interest in fiscal 2013  a reduction in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets as well as a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits and related interest contributed to the low effective tax rate 

at september 30 2014  and 2013  we had deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities of 5961 million  and 6176 million  respectively partially offset by valuation allowances of 311 million  and 310 million  respectively the valuation allowance for both periods primarily relates to our state deferred tax assets for net operating loss nol carryforwards we believe it is more likely than not that a portion of our state nol carryforwards will not be realized because some state nol carryforward periods are too brief to realize the related deferred tax assets 

at september 30 2014  we had tax benefits of 845 million  for state nol carryforwards that expire beginning at various times depending on the tax jurisdiction from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2034 we also had state tax credit carryforwards of 57 million  that will expire from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2024 and 19 million  of state tax credit carryforwards that have no expiration date 

when assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income in future periods we record a valuation allowance when we determine it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future results could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position also changes in existing federal and state tax laws and tax rates could affect future tax results and the valuation of our deferred tax assets 

unrecognized tax benefits are the differences between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefits recognized for accounting purposes we had no  unrecognized tax benefits at september 30 2014  and 42 million  of unrecognized tax benefits at september 30 2013  

we classify interest expense and penalties on income taxes as income tax expense during fiscal 2014  and 2013  we recognized interest benefits related to unrecognized tax benefits of 22 million  and 28 million  respectively in our consolidated statements of operations at september 30 2014  we had no  accrued interest or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits at september 30 2013  we had 22 million  of accrued interest and no  accrued penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits 

we are subject to federal income tax and to income tax in multiple states the statute of limitations for our major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for fiscal years 2010 through 2014 we are currently being audited by various states 

results of operations — homebuilding 

fiscal year ended september 30 2013  compared to fiscal year ended september 30 2012   

the following tables and related discussion set forth key operating and financial data for our homebuilding operations by reporting segment as of and for the fiscal years ended september 30 2013  and 2012  





 

 

net sales orders 

the value of net sales orders increased   37  to 65670 million   25120  homes in 2013  from 48033 million   21048  homes in 2012  with significant increases in five of our six market regions average selling prices increased in all regions and the volume of net sales orders increased in most regions indicating broad improvement in market conditions across our business 

the number of net sales orders increased   19  during 2013  compared to 2012  reflecting the improvement in new home demand and market conditions as well as the effects of investments we made to expand our operations the largest percentage increase occurred in our southeast region as a result of improved market conditions and our increased inventory investments in our atlanta jacksonville and orlando markets sales orders in our southeast region were also positively impacted by our acquisition of the homebuilding operations of breland homes during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 which contributed 674  net sales orders in 2013  compared to 118  net sales orders in 2012  the decrease in net sales orders in our southwest region was primarily due to sales decreases in our phoenix market as compared to 2012  when significant sales 

increases occurred in this market our overall net sales volume growth moderated in the second half of the year which we believe was due in part to the impact of increases in mortgage interest rates and higher home prices as well as our efforts to align our sales pace with our construction activities in many of our communities 

the average price of our net sales orders increased   15  to 261400  in 2013  from 228200  in 2012  resulting from our ability to raise sales prices in many of our communities as demand for new homes improved and the relative supply of homes for sale declined in many of our markets a small increase in the average size of our homes sold was also a contributing factor 

our sales order cancellation rate was 24  in both fiscal 2013  and 2012  our cancellation rates in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2013  were 24  and 31  respectively which were higher than the same periods of 2012  as potential buyers adjusted to the impact of higher mortgage interest rates and home prices 



sales order backlog 

our homes in backlog at september 30 2013  increased 13  from the prior year with more homes in backlog in most regions due to increases in net sales orders as compared with the prior year 



home sales revenue 

revenues from home sales increased   43  to 60248 million   24155  homes closed in 2013  from 42184 million   18890  homes closed in 2012  during fiscal 2013  home sales revenues increased in all of our market regions resulting from increases in the number of homes closed and increases in average selling prices due to favorable housing market conditions and our increased inventory investments 

  

the number of homes closed in fiscal 2013   increased   28  from 2012  due to increases in all of our market regions the most significant percentage increase occurred in our southeast region where the highest percentage increases occurred in the jacksonville orlando southwest florida and atlanta markets and where huntsville was a new market in fiscal 2013  in our west region the highest percentage increases occurred in the southern california portland and las vegas markets 

the average selling price of homes closed during 2013  was 249400  up   12  from the 223300  average in 2012  resulting from our ability to raise sales prices in many of our communities as demand for new homes improved from the prior year and the supply of homes for sale declined in many of our markets also a small increase in the average size of our homes closed was a contributing factor 



home sales gross profit 

gross profit from home sales increased  by 68  to 13 billion  in 2013  from 7455 million  in 2012  and increased   310 basis points to 208  as a percentage of home sales revenues approximately 210  basis points of the increase in the home sales gross profit percentage resulted from reduced sales incentives and increases in the average selling price of our homes closed partially offset by smaller increases in the average cost of our homes closed reflecting improved market conditions approximately 60  basis points of the increase was due to lower costs for warranty and construction defect claims as a percentage of home sales revenue the remaining 40  basis points of the increase was due to a decrease in the amortization of capitalized interest and property taxes as a percentage of home sales revenues resulting from the decrease in interest capitalized as a percentage of our active inventory from the prior year due to a decrease in the average interest rate on our outstanding debt and the growth in our active inventory 

our gross profit margins in fiscal 2013  benefited significantly from favorable market conditions that allowed us to increase sales prices and reduce incentives across most of our markets while we limited increases in construction costs our gross profit margins also benefited from reduced interest amortized to cost of sales as our average borrowing costs benefited from the maturity of some higher interest rate debt combined with the issuance of new debt securities with lower interest rates 

land sales and other revenues 

land sales and other revenues increased to 611 million  in 2013  from 178 million  in 2012  revenue from a single longterm construction project for which we served as the general contractor was included in land sales and other revenues revenue from this project was recognized on a percentageofcompletion basis as the construction was completed during fiscal 2013  and 2012  the revenue related to this project was 200 million  and 65 million  respectively and the gross profit was 44 million  and 12 million  respectively 

inventory and land option charges 

as of september 30 2013  we performed impairment evaluations of communities with a combined carrying value of 1659 million  and we recorded impairment charges of 213 million  during the fourth quarter to reduce the carrying values of impaired communities to their estimated fair values total impairment charges during fiscal 2013  and 2012  were 213 million  and 32 million  respectively 

during fiscal 2013  and 2012  we wrote off 98 million  and 30 million  respectively of earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs related to land option contracts that were expected to be terminated at september 30 2013  outstanding earnest money deposits associated with our portfolio of land and lot option purchase contracts totaled 424 million  

selling general and administrative sga expense 

sga expense from homebuilding activities increased   23  to 6499 million  in 2013  from 5287 million  in 2012  as a percentage of homebuilding revenues sga expense decreased   180 basis points to 107  in 2013  from 125  in 2012  the improvement in sga expenses as a percentage of revenues was due to an increase in both the volume and the average selling prices of our homes closed combined with our efforts to keep the growth in overhead expenses at a lower level than the growth in home closings volume and revenues 

employee compensation and related costs represented 65  and 63  of sga costs in 2013  and 2012  respectively these costs increased  by 27  to 4252 million  in 2013  from 3356 million  in 2012  mainly due to an increase in our number of employees and an increase in the level of incentive compensation related to the significant increases in profitability in 2013  as compared to 2012  our homebuilding operations employed approximately 3600  and 2740 employees at september 30 2013  and 2012  respectively 

our awards of performance based units to executive management are accounted for as liability awards and are measured quarterly with changes in value recorded in compensation expense within sga changes in our stock price and our performance compared to our peer group can cause significant changes in the value of these awards and in our compensation expense during fiscal 2013  and 2012  the compensation expense related to these liability awards was 88 million  and 98 million  respectively 

interest incurred 

comparing fiscal 2013  with fiscal 2012  interest incurred increased   39  to 1728 million  due to a 59   increase  in our average debt interest incurred in fiscal 2013  increased by a lower percentage than the increase in our average debt due to new debt issued at lower interest rates and the maturity of higher interest rate debt both of which reduced our average interest rate as compared to the prior year 

we capitalize interest costs incurred to inventory during active development and construction active inventory capitalized interest is charged to cost of sales as the related inventory is delivered to the buyer during fiscal 2012 and a portion of fiscal 2013 our active inventory was lower than our debt level and therefore a portion of the interest incurred was reflected as interest expense however during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2013 our active inventory exceeded our debt level and therefore all interest incurred during those periods was capitalized to inventory as a result 71 million  of interest was expensed during fiscal 2013  compared to 269 million  during 2012  interest amortized to cost of sales declined  to 23  of total home and landlot and other cost of sales in fiscal 2013  from 27  in fiscal 2012  as a result of a decrease in interest capitalized as a percentage of our active inventory from the prior year due to the decrease in the average interest rate on our outstanding debt and the growth in our active inventory 

other income 

other income net of other expenses included in our homebuilding operations was 149 million  in 2013  compared to 122 million  in 2012  other income consists of interest income rental income income from insurance related activities income associated with other incomeproducing assets and various other types of ancillary income gains expenses and losses not directly associated with our core homebuilding operations the activities that result in this ancillary income or loss are not significant either individually or in the aggregate 

acquisitions 

in august 2012  we acquired the homebuilding operations of breland homes for 1059 million  in cash of which 94 million  was paid in fiscal 2013 breland homes operates in huntsville and mobile alabama and along the coast of mississippi the assets acquired included approximately 300  homes in inventory 1000  lots and control of approximately 3700  additional lots through option contracts we also acquired a sales order backlog of 228  homes valued at 469 million

income before income taxes 

pretax income for fiscal 2013  was 6578 million  compared to 2429 million  for fiscal 2012  the difference in our operating results for 2013  compared to 2012  was due to higher revenues from increased home closings and sales of mortgage loans and higher profit margins in both our homebuilding and financial services businesses

our income tax expense in fiscal 2013  was 1951 million  compared to a benefit of 7134 million  in 2012  the effective tax rate in fiscal 2013  was 297  we did not have a meaningful effective tax rate in fiscal 2012  because our net deferred tax assets were fully offset by a valuation allowance until the third quarter of fiscal 2012  when we significantly reduced the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 

at september 30 2013  and 2012  we had deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities of 6176 million  and 7514 million  respectively offset by valuation allowances of 310 million  and 419 million  respectively at september 30 2013  we had tax benefits of 993 million  for state nol carryforwards that expire beginning at various times depending on the tax jurisdiction from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2032 we also had state tax credit carryforwards of 40 million  that expire from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2023 and 19 million  of state tax credit carryforwards had no expiration date 

when assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income in future periods we record a valuation allowance when we determine it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in fiscal 2012 we determined it was more likely than not that the substantial majority of our deferred tax assets would be realized which resulted in a 7532 million  reversal of all of the valuation allowance related to our federal deferred tax assets and a portion of the valuation allowance related to our state deferred tax assets 

further changes in the valuation allowance were recorded during fiscal 2013 based on our quarterly evaluations to determine the need for a valuation allowance related to our state deferred tax assets at march 31 2013 after considering the impact of significantly improving profits from operations we concluded it was more likely than not that we would realize more of our deferred tax assets related to state nol carryforwards than previously anticipated we based this conclusion on additional positive evidence related to the actual pretax profits achieved during the six months ended march 31 2013 and higher levels of forecasted profitability for the remainder of fiscal 2013 and in future years we expected these increased profits to result in a greater realization of our nol carryforwards in certain states before they expire than previously estimated accordingly at march 31 2013 we reduced the valuation allowance on our state deferred tax assets by 187 million  to a balance of 232 million  because this reduction of the valuation allowance was recognized in an interim period a portion of the valuation allowance to be reversed was allocated to the remaining interim periods therefore we reversed an additional 29 million  of the valuation allowance in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2013 additionally approximately 132 million  of our valuation allowance was attributable to state nol carryforwards that expired at the end of fiscal 2013 at which time the related unrealized deferred tax assets and valuation allowances were written off the amount of our valuation allowance at september 30 2013 as a result of the activity described above would have been 71 million  

at september 30 2013 we recorded an outofperiod adjustment which increased both our deferred income taxes and the valuation allowance on our deferred income taxes by 239 million  the outofperiod adjustment had no impact on our statement of operations during fiscal 2013 the increase in our deferred income taxes of 239 million  corrected an error in recording the future benefits for state nol carryforwards based on each of our legal entities’ nols in each state and the current tax rate of each state the valuation allowance was also increased by 239 million  because we determined it was more likely than not that these state nol carryforwards would not be realized because we estimated that we would not have sufficient taxable income within these states carryforward periods as a result of this adjustment the remaining amount of the valuation allowance related to state deferred tax assets was 310 million  at september 30 2013 our valuation allowance was based on an analysis of the amount of nol carryforwards associated with each of our legal entities in the states in which we conduct business as compared to our expected level of taxable income under existing apportionment or recognition rules in each state and the carryforward periods allowed in each states tax code had deferred income taxes related to the state nol carryforwards of each of our legal entities been reflected at state specific tax rates as of september 30 2012 our deferred income taxes would have increased by 316 million  and the corresponding valuation allowance on our deferred income taxes would have increased by 376 million  this would have resulted in a decrease in our income tax benefit of 60 million  in fiscal 2012 which would have reversed and decreased our income tax expense by 60 million  in fiscal 2013 the unadjusted amounts from fiscal 2012 were not material to our financial statements for fiscal 2012 and the outofperiod adjustment recorded in fiscal 2013 was not material to our financial statements for fiscal 2013 

at september 30 2013  and 2012  the total amount of our unrecognized tax benefits was 42 million  and 141 million  respectively during fiscal 2013  and 2012  we recognized interest benefits related to unrecognized tax benefits of 28 million  and 01 million  respectively in our consolidated statements of operations at september 30 2013  and 2012  our total accrued interest expense relating to unrecognized tax benefits was 22 million  and 51 million  respectively and there were no  accrued penalties 

the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was signed into law on january 2 2013 and did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

capital resources and liquidity 

we have historically funded our homebuilding and financial services operations with cash flows from operating activities borrowings under bank credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities our current levels of cash borrowing capacity and balance sheet leverage provide us with the operational flexibility to adjust to homebuilding market conditions during the last two years we have increased our investments in homes finished lots land and land development to expand our operations and grow our profitability we intend to maintain adequate liquidity and balance sheet strength and we regularly evaluate opportunities to access the capital markets 

at september 30 2014  our ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital was 394  compared to 446  at september 30 2013  our ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital homebuilding notes payable net of cash divided by homebuilding notes payable net of cash plus total equity was 345  at september 30 2014  compared to 363  at september 30 2013  the improvement in these ratios is primarily due to the conversion of our 2 convertible senior notes into equity during the current fiscal year which decreased our homebuilding debt and increased our total capital we intend to maintain our ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital within or below a range of 40  to 45  over the long term but we may choose to operate above this range for shortterm periods therefore future net homebuilding debt to total capital ratios may be higher than the current level 

we believe that the ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital is useful in understanding the leverage employed in our homebuilding operations and comparing our capital structure with other homebuilders because of its capital function we include our homebuilding cash as a reduction of our homebuilding debt and total capital we exclude the debt of our financial services business because it is separately capitalized and its obligation under its repurchase agreement is substantially collateralized and not guaranteed by our parent company or any of our homebuilding entities 

we believe that our existing cash resources our revolving credit facility and our mortgage repurchase facility provide sufficient liquidity to fund our nearterm working capital needs and debt obligations we regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund future growth in our business repay our future debt obligations and support our other general corporate and operational needs and we regularly evaluate our opportunities to raise additional capital we have an automatically effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec in september 2012 registering debt and equity securities which we may issue from time to time in amounts to be determined as market conditions permit we may issue new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets or obtain additional bank financing to fund our projected capital requirements or provide additional liquidity 

homebuilding capital resources 

cash and cash equivalents  — at september 30 2014  our homebuilding cash and cash equivalents were 6325 million  

  bank credit facility  — we have a senior unsecured revolving credit facility which was amended in august 2014 to increase its capacity from 725 million  to 975 million  and to extend its maturity date to september 7 2019  the facility has an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to 125 billion  subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments the facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit equal to approximately 50 of the revolving credit commitment letters of credit issued under the facility reduce the available borrowing capacity the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be based on either the prime rate or london interbank offered rate libor plus an applicable margin as defined in the credit agreement governing the facility at september 30 2014  we had 3000 million  of borrowings outstanding at a 29  annual interest rate and 927 million  of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility resulting in available capacity of 5823 million  

our revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on our operations and activities including requiring the maintenance of a minimum level of tangible net worth a maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and a borrowing base restriction if our ratio of debt to tangible net worth exceeds a certain level these covenants are measured as defined in the credit agreement governing the facility and are reported to the lenders quarterly a failure to comply with these financial covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under the revolving credit facility or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity in addition the credit agreement governing the facility imposes restrictions on the creation of secured debt and liens at september 30 2014  we were in compliance with all of the covenants limitations and restrictions of our revolving credit facility 

secured letter of credit agreements  — we have secured letter of credit agreements which require us to deposit cash in an amount approximating the balance of letters of credit outstanding as collateral with the issuing banks the amount of cash restricted for letters of credit issued under these agreements totaled 31 million  and 85 million  at september 30 2014  and 2013  respectively and is included in homebuilding restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets 

public unsecured debt — on january 15 2014 we repaid the remaining 1459 million  principal amount of our 6125 senior notes which were due on that date on september 15 2014 we repaid the remaining 1379 million  principal amount of our 5625 senior notes which were due on that date in february 2014 we issued 500 million  principal amount of 375 senior notes due march 1 2019  with interest payable semiannually the annual effective interest rate of the senior notes after giving effect to the amortization of financing costs is 39  we have 1577 million  principal amount of our senior notes maturing before the end of fiscal 2015  the indentures governing our senior notes impose restrictions on the creation of secured debt and liens at september 30 2014  we were in compliance with all of the limitations and restrictions that form a part of the public debt obligations 

during april and may of 2014 our outstanding 2 convertible senior notes were converted into 386 million  shares of our common stock the conversion rate was 7718004  shares of our common stock per 1000  principal amount of senior notes which was equivalent to a conversion price of approximately 1296  per share of common stock 

debt and equity repurchase authorizations  — effective august 1 2014  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 500 million  of debt securities and 100 million  of our common stock effective through july 31 2015  the full amount of each of these authorizations was remaining at september 30 2014  

financial services capital resources 

cash and cash equivalents  — at september 30 2014  our financial services cash and cash equivalents were 293 million  

mortgage repurchase facility  — our mortgage subsidiary dhi mortgage has a mortgage repurchase facility that is accounted for as a secured financing the mortgage repurchase facility provides financing and liquidity to dhi mortgage by facilitating purchase transactions in which dhi mortgage transfers eligible loans to the counterparties against the transfer of funds by the counterparties thereby becoming purchased loans dhi mortgage then has the right and obligation to repurchase the purchased loans upon their sale to thirdparty purchasers in the secondary market or within specified time frames from 45  to 120  days in accordance with the terms of the mortgage repurchase facility the total capacity of the facility is 300 million  however the capacity can be increased up to 400 million  subject to the availability of additional commitments in february 2014 the mortgage repurchase facility was renewed and amended this renewal and amendment extends the maturity date of the facility to february 27 2015  and allows for the capacity of the facility to be increased without requiring additional commitments from 300 million  to 325 million  on the last five days of any fiscal quarter and the first twentyfive days of the following fiscal quarter excluding the quarter ending december 31 2014 through an additional commitment obtained in september 2014 the capacity of the facility was temporarily increased to 400 million  until october 24 2014  

as of september 30 2014  4481 million  of mortgage loans held for sale with a collateral value of 4290 million  were pledged under the mortgage repurchase facility as a result of advance paydowns totaling 698 million  dhi mortgage had an obligation of 3592 million  outstanding under the mortgage repurchase facility at september 30 2014  at a 26  annual interest rate 

the mortgage repurchase facility is not guaranteed by dr horton inc or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt the facility contains financial covenants as to the mortgage subsidiary’s minimum required tangible net worth its maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and its minimum required liquidity these covenants are measured and reported monthly at september 30 2014  dhi mortgage was in compliance with all of the conditions and covenants of the mortgage repurchase facility 

in the past our mortgage subsidiary has been able to renew or extend its mortgage credit facility on satisfactory terms prior to its maturity and obtain temporary additional commitments through amendments to the credit agreement during periods of higher than normal volumes of mortgages held for sale the liquidity of our financial services business depends upon its continued ability to renew and extend the mortgage repurchase facility or to obtain other additional financing in sufficient capacities 

operating cash flow activities 

in fiscal 2014  we used 6614 million  of cash in our operating activities compared to 12 billion  in fiscal 2013  we used 9182 million  of cash to increase our construction in progress and finished home inventory compared to 8153 million  in fiscal 2013  we used 5136 million  of cash to increase our residential land and lot inventory through purchases of land and finished lots and increased land development activity compared to 12 billion  in fiscal 2013  cash used for operations in the prior year reflected our significant inventory investments as we responded to improved market conditions we slowed the growth of our land and lot inventories in fiscal 2014 to align with our desired level of owned land and lots while increasing our homes in inventory to capture an increased share of new home demand 

investing cash flow activities 

in fiscal 2014  net cash used in investing activities was 2821 million  compared to 1809 million  provided by investing activities in fiscal 2013  the primary use of cash for investing activities during fiscal 2014  was related to the acquisition of the homebuilding operations of crown communities for 2096 million  in cash we also purchased the homebuilding operations of regent homes for 345 million  

we used 1002 million  and 580 million  in fiscal 2014  and 2013  respectively to purchase property and equipment including model home furniture office and technology equipment and office buildings to support our operations the purchases of property and equipment during fiscal 2014  included the purchase of 177000  acres in new mexico as a longterm land investment for 560 million  of which 374 million  was paid in cash and 186 million  was notes payable assumed from the seller of the total purchase price 465 million  was allocated to land and the remainder was allocated to buildings improvements and equipment as part of the purchase we also obtained the livestock grazing rights under longterm leases on approximately 114000  acres of land we plan to use the property to conduct ranching and agricultural activities 

cash provided by investing activities during fiscal 2014  included a 678 million   decrease  in restricted cash due to a reduction in the amount of letters of credit that were cash collateralized in fiscal 2014  compared to an increase of 285 million  in restricted cash due to an increase in the amount of cash collateralized on letters of credit in fiscal 2013  

in fiscal 2013  the primary source of investing cash flows was the receipt of proceeds from the sale or maturity of marketable securities which totaled 2965 million  net of purchases additionally during fiscal 2013  we paid 186 million  to purchase defaulted debt securities collateralized by one residential real estate parcel and we paid 94 million  to complete our purchase of the homebuilding operations of breland homes acquired in august 2012 

financing cash flow activities 

we expect the shortterm financing needs of our operations will be funded with existing cash cash generated from profits and borrowings available under our homebuilding and financial services credit facilities longterm financing needs for the growth of our operations have historically been funded with the issuance of senior unsecured debt securities through the public capital markets 

in fiscal 2014  net cash provided by financing activities was 6279 million  consisting primarily of note proceeds partially offset by repayments of notes payable and payments of cash dividends proceeds from notes payable of 14 billion  included our issuance of 500 million  principal amount of 375 senior notes in february 2014 borrowings of 8100 million  on the revolving credit facility and borrowings of 1206 million  under our mortgage repurchase facility note repayments of 7969 million  included our repayment of 1459 million  principal amount of our 6125 senior notes and 1379 million  principal amount of our 5625 senior notes at maturity and our repayment of 5100 million  drawn on the revolving credit facility during fiscal 2013  financing activities provided 9390 million  of cash primarily from our issuance of a total of 11 billion  principal amount of senior notes borrowings of 1650 million  on the revolving credit facility and borrowings of 508 million  under our mortgage repurchase facility note repayments of 3451 million  in fiscal 2013  included our repayment of 1717 million  principal amount of our 6875 senior notes at maturity and repayment of the 1650 million  drawn on the revolving credit facility 

the board of directors approved and paid cash dividends of 00375  per common share in each of the second and third quarters of fiscal 2014  and a cash dividend of 00625  per common share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014  in november 2014  the board of directors approved a cash dividend of 00625  per common share payable on december 15 2014  to stockholders of record on december 1 2014  

during the first quarter of fiscal 2013  the board of directors approved and paid total cash dividends of 01875  per common share which included cash dividends of 00375  per share and an additional cash dividend of 015  per share the cash dividend of 015  per share was in lieu of and accelerated the payment of all quarterly dividends that would have otherwise been paid in calendar year 2013  

the declaration of future cash dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon among other things future earnings cash flows capital requirements our financial condition and general business conditions 

contractual cash obligations commercial commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

our primary contractual cash obligations for our homebuilding and financial services segments are payments under our debt agreements and lease payments under operating leases we expect to fund our contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business through a combination of our existing cash resources cash flows generated from profits our homebuilding and financial services credit facilities or other bank financing and the issuance of new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets as market conditions may permit 

our future cash requirements for contractual obligations as of september 30 2014  are presented below 



 

 

at september 30 2014  our homebuilding operations had outstanding letters of credit of 958 million  of which 31 million  were cash collateralized and surety bonds of 8762 million  issued by third parties to secure performance under various contracts we expect that our performance obligations secured by these letters of credit and bonds will generally be completed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms when we complete our performance obligations the related letters of credit and bonds are generally released shortly thereafter leaving us with no continuing obligations we have no material thirdparty guarantees 

our mortgage subsidiary enters into various commitments related to the lending activities of our mortgage operations further discussion of these commitments is provided in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” under part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts to acquire land or lots for the construction of homes lot option contracts enable us to control significant lot positions with limited capital investment and substantially reduce the risks associated with land ownership and development among our land and lot option purchase contracts at september 30 2014  there were a limited number of contracts representing 309 million  of remaining purchase price subject to specific performance clauses which may require us to purchase the land or lots upon the land sellers meeting their contractual obligations further information about our land option contracts is provided in the “inventories land and lot position and homes in inventory” section included herein 

seasonality 

although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again in the future we generally have more homes under construction close more homes and have greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year the seasonal activity increases our working capital requirements for our homebuilding operations during our third and fourth fiscal quarters and increases our funding requirements for the mortgages we originate in our financial services segment at the end of these quarters as a result of seasonal activity our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year 

inflation 

we may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation primarily because of higher land financing labor and material construction costs in addition higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers we attempt to pass through to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices however during periods when housing market conditions are challenging we may not be able to offset our cost increases with higher selling prices 

forwardlooking statements

critical accounting policies 

general  — a comprehensive enumeration of the significant accounting policies of dr horton inc and subsidiaries is presented in note a  to the accompanying financial statements as of september 30 2014  and 2013  and for the years ended september 30 2014  2013  and 2012  each of our accounting policies has been chosen based upon current authoritative literature that collectively comprises us generally accepted accounting principles gaap in instances where alternative methods of accounting are permissible under gaap we have chosen the method that most appropriately reflects the nature of our business the results of our operations and our financial condition and have consistently applied those methods over each of the periods presented in the financial statements the audit committee of our board of directors has reviewed and approved the accounting policies selected 

revenue recognition  — we generally recognize homebuilding revenue and related profit at the time of the closing of a sale when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer in situations where the buyer’s financing is originated by dhi mortgage our 100 owned mortgage subsidiary and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment the profit is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a thirdparty purchaser has been completed any profit on land sales is deferred until the full accrual method criteria are met when appropriate revenue and profit on longterm construction projects are recognized under the percentageofcompletion method 

we include proceeds from home closings held for our benefit at title companies in homebuilding cash when we execute sales contracts with our homebuyers or when we require advance payment from homebuyers for custom changes upgrades or options related to their homes we record the cash deposits received as liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are canceled we either retain or refund to the homebuyer deposits on canceled sales contracts depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances 

we recognize financial services revenues associated with our title operations as closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued both of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed we transfer substantially all underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies to thirdparty insurers we typically elect the fair value option for our mortgage loan originations mortgage loans held for sale are initially recorded at fair value based on either sale commitments or current market quotes and are adjusted for subsequent changes in fair value until the loans are sold net origination costs and fees associated with mortgage loans are recognized at the time of origination the expected net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of a loan are included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings at the time of commitment we generally sell the mortgages we originate and the related servicing rights to thirdparty purchasers interest income is earned from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold 

some mortgage loans are sold with limited recourse provisions which can result in repurchases of loans previously sold to investors or payments to reimburse investors for loan losses based on historical experience discussions with our mortgage purchasers analysis of the mortgages we originated and current housing and credit market conditions we estimate and record a loss reserve for mortgage loans held in portfolio and mortgage loans held for sale as well as known and projected mortgage loan repurchase requests a 40 increase in the amount of expected mortgage loan repurchases and expected losses on mortgage loan repurchases would not result in a material change in our reserve for expected mortgage loan repurchases 

inventories and cost of sales  — inventory includes the costs of direct land acquisition land development and home construction capitalized interest real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and home construction costs that we incur after development projects or homes are substantially complete such as utilities maintenance and cleaning are charged to sga expense as incurred all indirect overhead costs such as compensation of sales personnel division and region management and the costs of advertising and builder’s risk insurance are charged to sga expense as incurred 

land and development costs are typically allocated to individual residential lots on a prorata basis and the costs of residential lots are transferred to construction in progress when home construction begins we use the specific identification method for the purpose of accumulating home construction costs cost of sales for homes closed includes the specific construction costs of each home and all applicable land acquisition land development and related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred allocated to each residential lot based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each community any changes to the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial home closings in a community are generally allocated on a prorata basis to the remaining homes in the community associated with the relevant development activity 

when a home is closed we generally have not paid all incurred costs necessary to complete the home we record as a liability and as a charge to cost of sales the amount we estimate will ultimately be paid related to completed homes that have been closed we compare our home construction budgets to actual recorded costs to determine the additional costs remaining to be paid on each closed home we monitor the accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on closed homes in subsequent months to the amounts previously accrued although actual costs to be paid in the future on previously closed homes could differ from our current accruals such differences have not been significant 

each quarter the performance and outlook of land inventory and communities under development are reviewed for indicators of potential impairment we generally review our inventory for impairment indicators at the community level and the inventory within each community is categorized as land held for development residential land and lots developed and under development land held for sale and construction in progress and finished homes based on the stage of production or plans for future development or sale a particular community often includes inventory in more than one category in certain situations inventory may be analyzed separately for impairment purposes based on its product type eg single family homes evaluated separately from condominium parcels in reviewing each of our communities we determine if impairment indicators exist on inventory held and used by analyzing a variety of factors including but not limited to the following 

 

if indicators of impairment are present for a community we perform an impairment evaluation of the community which includes an analysis to determine if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts and if so impairment charges are recorded to cost of sales if the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying amounts these estimates of cash flows are significantly impacted by community specific factors including estimates of the amounts and timing of future revenues and estimates of the amount of land development materials and labor costs which in turn may be impacted by the following local market conditions 

 

for those assets deemed to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets our determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams when an impairment charge for a community is determined the charge is then allocated to each lot in the community in the same manner as land and development costs are allocated to each lot impairment charges are also recorded on finished homes in substantially completed communities when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values are greater than the fair values less estimated costs to sell these homes 

for the inventory impairment analyses we performed during fiscal 2014  we assumed that for the majority of communities sales prices in future periods will be equal to or lower than current sales order prices in each community or in comparable communities in order to generate an acceptable absorption rate the remaining lives of the communities evaluated were estimated to be in a range from six months to ten years and we utilized a range of discount rates for communities from 12  to 18  

we rarely purchase land for resale however when we own land or communities under development that do not fit into our development and construction plans and determine we will sell the asset the project is accounted for as land held for sale we record land held for sale at the lesser of its carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell in performing the impairment evaluation for land held for sale we consider several factors including but not limited to recent offers received to purchase the property prices for land in recent comparable sales transactions and market analysis studies which include the estimated price a willing buyer would pay for the land if the estimated fair value less costs to sell an asset is less than the current carrying value the asset is written down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell 

the key assumptions relating to inventory valuations are impacted by local market economic conditions and the actions of competitors and are inherently uncertain although our quarterly assessments reflect management’s best estimates due to uncertainties in the estimation process actual results could differ from such estimates 

business acquisitions   we account for acquisitions of businesses by allocating the purchase price of the business to the various assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired particularly intangible assets these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies while we believe the estimates and assumptions are reasonable they are inherently uncertain unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions 

goodwill   we record goodwill associated with our acquisitions of businesses when the purchase price of the business exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired we evaluate our goodwill balances for potential impairment on an annual basis the accounting guidance allows an entity to assess qualitatively whether it is necessary to perform step one of a prescribed twostep annual goodwill impairment test if an entity believes as a result of its qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount the twostep goodwill impairment test is not required we performed a qualitative assessment of our goodwill balance of 948 million  and 389 million  at september 30 2014  and 2013  respectively and determined that the twostep process was not necessary 

warranty claims  — we typically provide our homebuyers with a tenyear limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems a twoyear limited warranty on major mechanical systems and a oneyear limited warranty on other construction components since we subcontract our construction work to subcontractors who typically provide an indemnity and a certificate of insurance prior to receiving payments for their work claims relating to workmanship and materials are generally the primary responsibility of the subcontractors warranty liabilities have been established by charging cost of sales for each home delivered the amounts charged are based on management’s estimate of expected warrantyrelated costs under all unexpired warranty obligation periods our warranty liability is based upon historical warranty cost experience in each market in which we 

operate and is adjusted as appropriate to reflect qualitative risks associated with the types of homes we build and the geographic areas in which we build them actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts a 10 change in the historical warranty rates used to estimate our warranty accrual would not result in a material change in our accrual 

legal claims and insurance  — we are named as a defendant in various claims complaints and other legal actions in the ordinary course of business at any point in time we are managing several hundred individual claims related to construction defect matters personal injury claims employment matters land development issues and contract disputes we have established reserves for these contingencies based on the estimated costs of pending claims and the estimated costs of anticipated future claims related to previously closed homes at both september 30 2014  and 2013  99  of these reserves related to construction defect matters 

our reserves for construction defect claims include the estimated costs of both known claims and anticipated future claims as of september 30 2014  and 2013  we had reserves for approximately 180  and 160  pending construction defect claims respectively and no individual existing claim was material to our financial statements during fiscal 2014  we established reserves for approximately 80  new construction defect claims and resolved 60  construction defect claims for a total cost of 337 million  the majority of our total construction defect reserves consists of the estimated exposure to future claims on previously closed homes we have closed a significant number of homes during recent years and we may be subject to future construction defect claims on these homes although regulations vary from state to state construction defect issues can generally be reported for up to ten years after the home has closed in many states in which we operate historical data and trends regarding the frequency of claims incurred and the costs to resolve claims relative to the types of products and markets where we operate are used to estimate the construction defect liabilities for both existing and anticipated future claims these estimates are subject to ongoing revision as the circumstances of individual pending claims and historical data and trends change adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the accounting period in which the change in estimate occurs 

historical trends in construction defect claims have been inconsistent and we believe they may continue to fluctuate over the next several years housing market conditions have been volatile across most of our markets over the past ten years and we believe such conditions can affect the frequency and cost of construction defect claims we closed a significant number of homes during our peak operating years from 2003 to 2007 if the ultimate resolution of construction defect claims resulting from closings in those years varies from current expectations it could significantly change our estimates regarding the frequency and timing of claims incurred and the costs to resolve existing and anticipated future claims which would impact the construction defect reserves in the future if the frequency of claims incurred or costs of existing and future legal claims significantly exceed our current estimates they will have a significant negative impact on our future earnings and liquidity 

we estimate and record receivables under applicable insurance policies related to our estimated contingencies for known claims and anticipated future construction defect claims on previously closed homes and other legal claims and lawsuits incurred in the ordinary course of business when recovery is probable additionally we may have the ability to recover a portion of our losses from our subcontractors and their insurance carriers when we have been named as an additional insured on their insurance policies 

the estimation of losses related to these reserves and the related estimates of recoveries from insurance policies are subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends in construction defect claims relative to our markets and the types of products built claim frequency claim settlement costs and patterns insurance industry practices and legal interpretations among others due to the high degree of judgment required in establishing reserves for these contingencies actual future costs and recoveries from insurance could differ significantly from current estimated amounts a 10 increase in the claim frequency and the average cost per claim used to estimate the reserves would result in an increase of approximately 965 million  in our reserves and a 517 million  increase in our receivable resulting in additional expense of 448 million  a 10 decrease in the claim frequency and the average cost per claim would result in a decrease of approximately 767 million  in our reserves and a 381 million  decrease in our receivable resulting in a reduction in expense of 386 million  

income taxes  — we calculate our income tax expense benefit using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and of tax loss and credit carryforwards in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income in future periods and in the jurisdictions in which those temporary differences become deductible we record a valuation allowance when we determine it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized in determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns judgment is required differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position changes in existing tax laws and tax rates also affect actual tax results and the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 

interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in the financial statements as a component of income tax expense significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions we evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis our evaluations are based upon a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change 

stockbased compensation  — our common stockholders formally authorize shares of stockbased compensation available for future grants from time to time the compensation committee of our board of directors authorizes the grant of stockbased compensation to our employees and directors from these available shares at september 30 2014  our outstanding stockbased compensation awards include stock options and restricted stock units grants of restricted stock units may vest immediately or over a certain number of years as determined by the compensation committee of our board of directors restricted stock units outstanding at september 30 2014  have a remaining vesting period of 1  to 3 years  stock options are granted at exercise prices which equal the market value of our common stock at the date of the grant the stock options outstanding at september 30 2014  vest over periods of 2  to 975 years from the initial grant date and expire 10 years  after the dates on which they were granted 

the compensation expense for stockbased awards is based on the fair value of the award and is recognized on a straightline basis over the remaining vesting period the fair values of restricted stock units are based on the stock prices at the date of grant the fair values of stock options granted are calculated on the date of grant using a blackscholes option pricing model determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions which involve a number of variables these variables include but are not limited to the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards the expected dividend yield and expected stock option exercise behavior in addition we also use judgment in estimating the number of sharebased awards that are expected to be forfeited the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense are reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows as a financing cash flow 

fair value measurements  — the fasb’s authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes a threelevel hierarchy based upon the inputs to the valuation model of an asset or liability the fair value hierarchy and its application to our assets and liabilities is as follows 

 

when available we use quoted market prices in active markets to determine fair value we consider the principal market and nonperformance risk associated with our counterparties when determining the fair value measurements if applicable fair value measurements are used for our mortgage loans held for sale debt securities collateralized by residential real estate interest rate lock commitments irlcs and other derivative instruments on a recurring basis and are used for inventories other mortgage loans rental properties and real estate owned on a nonrecurring basis when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in january 2014 the fasb issued asu 201404 “receivables  troubled debt restructurings by creditors” which clarifies when an in substance repossession or foreclosure of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan has occurred this guidance helps determine when a creditor should derecognize a loan receivable and recognize real estate property the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2015 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers” which is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model requiring a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount reflecting the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2017 and allows for both full retrospective or modified retrospective methods of adoption we are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in june 2014 the fasb issued asu 201411 “transfers and servicing  repurchasetomaturity transactions repurchase financings and disclosures” which changes the accounting for repurchasetomaturity transactions to secured borrowing accounting also for repurchase financing arrangements the amendments require separate accounting for a transfer of a financial asset executed contemporaneously with a repurchase agreement with the same counterparty which will result in secured borrowing accounting for the repurchase agreement the guidance is effective for us beginning january 1 2015 and will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in june 2014 the fasb issued asu 201412 “compensation  stock compensation” which states that a performance target in a sharebased payment that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period should be accounted for as a performance condition the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2016 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in august 2014 the fasb issued asu 201414 “receivables  troubled debt restructurings by creditors” which requires that certain governmentguaranteed mortgage loans including those guaranteed by the fha and va be derecognized and that a separate other receivable be recognized upon foreclosure if certain conditions are met upon foreclosure the separate other receivable should be measured based on the amount of the loan balance expected to be recovered from the guarantor the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2015 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in august 2014 the fasb issued asu 201415 “presentation of financial statements  going concern” which provides guidance about managements responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the entitys ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures this guidance is intended to reduce the diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures the guidance is effective for us at the end of fiscal 2017 and is not expected to have any impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

we are subject to interest rate risk on our longterm debt we monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and utilize both fixed and variable rate debt for fixed rate debt changes in interest rates generally affect the value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows conversely for variable rate debt changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument but may affect our future earnings and cash flows except in very limited circumstances we do not have an obligation to prepay fixedrate debt prior to maturity and as a result interest rate risk and changes in fair value would not have a significant impact on our cash flows related to our fixedrate debt until such time as we are required to refinance repurchase or repay such debt 

we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with our mortgage loan origination services we manage interest rate risk through the use of forward sales of mortgagebacked securities mbs which are referred to as “hedging instruments” in the following discussion we do not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate lock commitments irlcs are extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and who meet defined credit and underwriting criteria typically the irlcs have a duration of less than six months some irlcs are committed immediately to a specific purchaser through the use of bestefforts whole loan delivery commitments while other irlcs are funded prior to being committed to thirdparty purchasers the hedging instruments related to irlcs are classified and accounted for as derivative instruments in an economic hedge with gains and losses recognized in financial services revenues in the consolidated statements of operations hedging instruments related to funded uncommitted loans are accounted for at fair value with changes recognized in financial services revenues in the consolidated statements of operations along with changes in the fair value of the funded uncommitted loans the fair value change related to the hedging instruments generally offsets the fair value change in the uncommitted loans the net fair value change which for the years ended september 30 2014  and 2013  was not significant is recognized in current earnings at september 30 2014  hedging instruments used to mitigate interest rate risk related to uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale and uncommitted irlcs totaled a notional amount of 5920 million  uncommitted irlcs totaled a notional amount of approximately 2750 million  and uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale totaled a notional amount of approximately 3486 million  at september 30 2014  

the following table sets forth principal cash flows by scheduled maturity effective weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value of our debt obligations as of september 30 2014  because the mortgage repurchase facility is effectively secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale which are typically sold within 60 days its outstanding balance is included in the most current period presented the interest rates for our variable rate debt represent the weighted average interest rates in effect at september 30 2014

operating structure and processes 

following is an overview of our companys operating structure and the significant processes that support our business controls strategies and performance 

homebuilding markets 

our homebuilding business began in the dallasfort worth area which is still one of our largest local homebuilding operations and home to our corporate headquarters we currently operate in 27 states and 78  markets which provides us with geographic diversification in our homebuilding inventory investments and our sources of revenues and earnings we believe our geographic diversification lowers our operational risks by mitigating the effects of local and regional economic cycles and it also enhances our earnings potential by providing more diverse opportunities to invest in our business 

we conduct our homebuilding operations in the geographic regions states and markets listed below and we conduct our mortgage and title operations in many of these markets our homebuilding operating divisions are aggregated into six reporting segments also referred to as reporting regions which comprise the markets below our financial statements contain additional information regarding segment performance 



when evaluating new or existing homebuilding markets for purposes of capital allocation we consider local marketspecific factors including among others 

 

economies of scale 

we are the largest homebuilding company in the united states in fiscal 2013  as measured by number of homes closed revenues and pretax income and we are also one of the largest builders in many of the markets in which we operate we believe that our national regional and local scale of operations provides us with benefits that may not be available to the same degree to some other smaller homebuilders such as 

 

decentralized homebuilding operations 

we view homebuilding as a local business therefore most of our direct homebuilding activities are decentralized which provides flexibility to our local managers on operational decisions at september 30 2013  we had 34  separate homebuilding operating divisions many of which operate in more than one market area generally each operating division consists of a division president a controller land entitlement acquisition and development personnel a sales manager and sales and marketing personnel a construction manager and construction superintendents customer service personnel a purchasing manager and office staff we believe that our division presidents and their management teams who are familiar with local conditions generally have the best information on which to base many decisions regarding their operations our division presidents receive performance based compensation if they achieve targeted financial and operating metrics related to their operating divisions following is a summary of our homebuilding activities that are decentralized in our local operating divisions and the control and oversight functions that are centralized in our regional and corporate offices 

operating division responsibilities 

each operating division is responsible for 

 — a feasibility study 

— soil and environmental reviews 

— review of existing zoning and other governmental requirements 

— review of the need for and extent of offsite work required to meet local building codes and 

— financial analysis of the potential project 

 

centralized controls 

we centralize many important risk elements of our homebuilding business through our regional and corporate offices we have four separate homebuilding regional offices generally each regional office consists of a region president legal counsel a chief financial officer and limited office support staff each of our region presidents and their management teams are responsible for oversight of the operations of a number of homebuilding operating divisions including 

 

our corporate executives and corporate office departments are responsible for establishing our operational policies and internal control standards and for monitoring compliance with established policies and controls throughout our operations the corporate office also has primary responsibility for direct management of certain key risk elements and initiatives through the following centralized functions 

 

cost controls 

we control construction costs by designing our homes efficiently and by obtaining competitive bids for construction materials and labor we also competitively bid and negotiate pricing from our subcontractors and suppliers based on the volume of services and products we purchase on a local regional and national basis we monitor our land development expenditures and construction costs versus budgets for each house and community and we review our inventory levels margins expenses profitability and returns for each operating market compared to both its business plan and our performance expectations 

we control overhead costs by centralizing certain accounting and administrative functions and by monitoring staffing and compensation levels we review other general and administrative costs to identify efficiencies and savings opportunities in our operating divisions and our regional and corporate offices we also direct many of our promotional activities toward local real estate brokers which we believe is an efficient use of our advertising expenditures 

landlot acquisition and inventory management 

we acquire land after we have completed due diligence and generally after we have obtained the rights known as entitlements to begin development or construction work resulting in an acceptable number of residential lots before we acquire lots or tracts of land we complete a feasibility study which includes soil tests independent environmental studies other engineering work and financial analysis we also evaluate the status of necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements required to develop and use the property for home construction although we purchase and develop land primarily to support our homebuilding activities we may sell land and lots to other developers and homebuilders where we have excess land and lot positions 

we also enter into landlot option contracts in which we obtain the right but generally not the obligation to buy land or lots at predetermined prices on a defined schedule commensurate with anticipated home closings or planned development our option contracts generally are nonrecourse which limits our financial exposure to our earnest money deposited with land and lot sellers and any preacquisition due diligence costs we incur this enables us to control land and lot positions with limited capital investment which substantially reduces the risks associated with land ownership and development 

we directly acquire almost all of our land and lot positions we are a party to a small number of joint ventures all of which are consolidated in our financial statements 

we attempt to mitigate our exposure to real estate inventory risks by 

 

land development and home construction 

substantially all of our land development and home construction work is performed by subcontractors subcontractors typically are selected after a competitive bidding process and are retained for a specific subdivision or series of house plans pursuant to a contract that obligates the subcontractor to complete the scope of work at an agreedupon price we employ land development managers and construction superintendents to monitor land development and home construction activities participate in major design and building decisions coordinate the activities of subcontractors and suppliers review the work of subcontractors for quality and cost controls and monitor compliance with zoning and building codes in addition our construction superintendents play a significant role in working with our homebuyers by assisting with option selection and home modification decisions educating buyers on the construction process and instructing buyers on postclosing home maintenance 

our home designs are selected or prepared in each of our markets to appeal to the tastes and preferences of local homebuyers in each community we offer optional interior and exterior features to allow homebuyers to enhance the basic home design and to allow us to generate additional revenues from each home sold we continually adjust our product offerings to address our customers’ expectations for affordability home size and features construction time for our homes depends on the availability of labor materials and supplies the weather the size of the home and other factors we complete the construction of most homes within three  to six months  

we typically do not maintain significant inventories of land development or construction materials except for work in progress materials for active development projects and homes under construction generally the construction materials used in our operations are readily available from numerous sources we have contracts exceeding one year with certain suppliers of building materials that are cancelable at our option as housing demand and land development and home construction activity increased in fiscal 2012 and 2013 we experienced some temporary shortages and delays of materials and labor in some of our operating markets none of which had a material effect on our consolidated operating results 

marketing and sales 

we market and sell our homes primarily through commissioned employees and the majority of our home closings also involve an independent real estate broker we typically conduct home sales from sales offices located in furnished model homes in each subdivision and we generally do not offer our model homes for sale until the completion of a subdivision our sales personnel assist prospective homebuyers by providing floor plans and price information demonstrating the features and layouts of model homes and assisting with the selection of options and other custom features we train and inform our sales personnel as to the availability of financing construction schedules and marketing and advertising plans as market conditions warrant we may provide potential homebuyers with one or more of a variety of incentives including discounts and free upgrades to be competitive in a particular market 

we market our homes and communities to prospective homebuyers and real estate brokers through electronic media including email social networking sites and our company website as well as brochures flyers newsletters and promotional events we also use billboards radio television magazine and newspaper advertising as necessary in each local market we attempt to position our subdivisions in locations that are desirable to potential homebuyers and convenient to or visible from local traffic patterns which helps to reduce advertising costs model homes play a substantial role in our marketing efforts and we expend significant effort and resources to create an attractive atmosphere in our model homes 

we also build speculative homes in most of our subdivisions these homes enhance our marketing and sales efforts to prospective homebuyers who are relocating to these markets as well as to independent brokers who often represent homebuyers requiring a home within a short time frame we determine our speculative homes strategy in each market based on local market factors such as new job growth the number of job relocations housing demand and supply seasonality current sales contract cancellation trends and our past experience in the market we maintain a level of speculative home inventory in each subdivision based on our current and planned sales pace and we monitor and adjust speculative home inventory on an ongoing basis as conditions warrant speculative homes help to provide us with opportunities to compete effectively with existing homes available in the market and improve our profits and returns on our inventory of owned lots 

sales contracts and backlog 

our sales contracts require an earnest money deposit which varies in amount across our markets and subdivisions additionally customers are generally required to pay additional deposits when they select options or upgrade features for their homes our sales contracts include a financing contingency which permits customers to cancel and receive a refund of their deposit if they cannot obtain mortgage financing at prevailing or specified interest rates within a specified period our contracts may include other contingencies such as the sale of an existing home most of our sales contracts stipulate that when customers cancel their contracts with us we have the right to retain their earnest money and option deposits however our operating divisions often choose to refund the deposit 

sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period at september 30 2013  the value of our backlog of sales orders was 22101 million   8205  homes an increase of 33  from 16679 million   7240  homes at september 30 2012  the average sales price of homes in backlog was 269400  at september 30 2013  up 17  from the 230400  average at september 30 2012  many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies such as those described above which can result in cancellations a portion of the contracts in backlog will not result in closings due to cancellations as a percentage of gross sales orders cancellations of sales contracts were 24  in both fiscal 2013  and 2012  

the length of time between the signing of a sales contract for a home and delivery of the home to the buyer closing is generally from two  to six months  therefore substantially all of the homes in our sales backlog at september 30 2013  are scheduled to close in fiscal year 2014  further discussion of our backlog is provided in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

customer service and quality control 

our operating divisions are responsible for preclosing quality control inspections and responding to customers’ postclosing needs we believe that a prompt and courteous response to homebuyers’ needs during and after construction reduces postclosing repair costs enhances our reputation for quality and service and ultimately leads to repeat and referral business from the real estate community and homebuyers we typically provide our homebuyers with a tenyear limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems a twoyear limited warranty on major mechanical systems and a oneyear limited warranty on other construction components the subcontractors who perform the actual construction also provide us with warranties on workmanship and are generally prepared to respond to us and the homeowner promptly upon request in addition some of our suppliers provide manufacturer’s warranties on specified products installed in the home 

customer mortgage financing 

we provide mortgage financing services principally to purchasers of our homes in the majority of our homebuilding markets through our 100 owned subsidiary dhi mortgage dhi mortgage assists in the sales transaction by coordinating the mortgage application mortgage commitment and home closing processes to facilitate a timely and efficient homebuying experience for our buyers dhi mortgage originates mortgage loans for a substantial portion of our homebuyers during the year ended september 30 2013  dhi mortgage provided mortgage financing services for approximately 56  of our total homes closed and approximately 86  of dhi mortgage’s loan volume related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations most of our homebuilding divisions also work with a number of additional mortgage lenders that offer a range of mortgage financing programs to our homebuyers 

to limit the risks associated with our mortgage operations dhi mortgage originates loan products that we believe can be sold to thirdparty purchasers dhi mortgage sells substantially all of the loans and their servicing rights to thirdparty purchasers shortly after origination with limited recourse provisions dhi mortgage centralizes most of its control and oversight functions including those related to loan underwriting quality control compliance with investor standards and regulatory requirements secondary marketing of loans hedging activities accounting and financial and operational reporting 

title services 

through our subsidiary title companies we serve as a title insurance agent in selected markets by providing title insurance policies examination and closing services primarily to the purchasers of homes we build and sell we currently assume little or no underwriting risk associated with these title policies 

employees 

at september 30 2013  we employed 4609 persons of whom 1104  were sales and marketing personnel 1079  were involved in construction 1418  were office personnel and 1008  worked in mortgage and title operations we believe that we have good relations with our employees 

acquisitions 

we routinely evaluate opportunities to profitably expand our operations including potential acquisitions of other homebuilding or related businesses in fiscal 2012 we acquired the homebuilding operations of breland homes and in october 2013  we acquired the homebuilding operations of regent homes inc for an estimated 35 million  in cash regent homes operates in charlotte greensboro and winstonsalem north carolina the assets acquired from regent included approximately 240  homes in inventory 300  lots and control of approximately 600  additional lots through option contracts as well as a sales order backlog of 213  homes valued at 311 million  

acquisitions of homebuilding businesses can provide us with immediate land and home inventories as well as control of additional land and lot positions through option contracts in addition employees may have specialized knowledge of local market conditions including existing relationships with municipalities land owners developers subcontractors and suppliers these inventory positions and local market knowledge and relationships could take us several years to develop through our own startup efforts we seek to limit the risks associated with acquiring other companies by conducting extensive operational financial and legal due diligence on each acquisition and by performing financial analysis to determine that each acquisition will have a positive impact on our earnings within an acceptable period of time 

competition 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous other national regional and local homebuilders for homebuyers desirable properties raw materials skilled labor employees management talent and financing we also compete with resales of existing and foreclosed homes and with the rental housing market our homes compete on the basis of quality price design mortgage financing terms and location our financial services businesses compete with other title companies and mortgage lenders including national regional and local mortgage bankers and other financial institutions some of which are subject to fewer government regulations or have greater access to capital different lending criteria and broader product offerings 

governmental regulation and environmental matters 

the homebuilding industry is subject to extensive and complex regulations we and the subcontractors we use must comply with many federal state and local laws and regulations including zoning density and development requirements building environmental advertising labor and real estate sales rules and regulations these regulations and requirements affect substantially all aspects of our land development and home design construction and sales processes in varying degrees across our markets our homes are inspected by local authorities where required and homes eligible for insurance or guarantees provided by the federal housing administration fha and the department of veteran affairs va are subject to inspection by them these regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities in addition our new housing developments may be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets utilities and other public improvements 

our homebuilding operations are also subject to an extensive variety of local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning protection of health safety and the environment the particular environmental laws for each site vary greatly according to location environmental condition and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties 

our mortgage company and title insurance agencies must comply with extensive federal and state laws and regulations as administered by numerous federal and state government agencies these include eligibility and other requirements for participation in the programs offered by the fha va government national mortgage association ginnie mae federal national mortgage association fannie mae federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac and the united states department of agriculture usda these laws and regulations also require compliance with consumer lending laws and other regulations governing disclosure requirements prohibitions against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures these laws and regulations subject our operations to regular extensive examinations by the applicable agencies 

seasonality 

although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again in the future we generally have more homes under construction close more homes and have greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year the seasonal activity increases our working capital requirements for our homebuilding operations during our third and fourth fiscal quarters and increases our funding requirements for the mortgages we originate in our financial services segment at the end of these quarters as a result of seasonal activity our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend 

discussion of our business and operations included in this annual report on form 10k should be read together with the risk factors set forth below they describe various risks and uncertainties we are or may become subject to many of which are difficult to predict or beyond our control these risks and uncertainties together with other factors described elsewhere in this report have the potential to affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner 

the homebuilding industry experienced a significant downturn in recent years although industry conditions improved during fiscal 2012 and 2013 the general us economy remains weak a subsequent deterioration in industry conditions could adversely affect our business or financial results 

we experienced one of the most severe housing downturns in us history from 2006 through 2011 during this downturn we experienced significant reductions in our home sales and homebuilding revenues and we incurred substantial asset impairments and writeoffs our recent results and other national data indicate that the overall demand for new homes improved during fiscal 2012 and 2013 however both national new home sales and our companys home sales remain below historical levels due to the current weak us economic conditions the restrictive mortgage lending environment and variations in local housing market conditions a subsequent deterioration in industry conditions could adversely affect our business and financial results 

the homebuilding industry is cyclical and affected by changes in economic real estate or other conditions that could adversely affect our business or financial results 

the homebuilding industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic and real estate conditions such as 

 

adverse changes in these general and local economic conditions or deterioration in the broader economy could have a negative impact on our business and financial results also changes in these economic conditions may affect some of our regions or markets more than others if adverse conditions affect any of our larger markets they could have a proportionately greater impact on us than on some other homebuilding companies 

in recent years concerns regarding the us government’s fiscal policies and economic stimulus actions have created uncertainty in the financial markets and caused volatility in interest rates which has impacted business and consumer confidence federal government actions related to economic stimulus taxation and spending levels borrowing limits potential government shutdowns the implementation of federal healthcare legislation and the related political debates conflicts and compromises associated with such actions may negatively impact the financial markets and consumer confidence and spending which could hurt the us economy and the housing market such events could adversely affect our homebuilding and financial services businesses and operating results 

weather conditions and natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes wildfires volcanic activity droughts and floods can harm our homebuilding business these can delay our development work home construction and home closings adversely affect the cost or availability of materials or labor or damage homes under construction the climates and geology of many of the states in which we operate including california florida texas and other coastal areas where we have some of our larger operations present increased risks of adverse weather or natural disasters 

deployments of us military personnel to foreign regions terrorist attacks other acts of violence or threats to national security and any corresponding response by the united states or others or related domestic or international instability may cause an economic slowdown in the markets where we operate which could adversely affect our homebuilding business 

if we experience any of the foregoing potential customers may be less willing or able to buy our homes in the future our pricing and product strategies may also be limited by market conditions we may be unable to change the mix of our home offerings reduce the costs of the homes we build offer more affordable homes or satisfactorily address changing market conditions in other ways without adversely affecting our profit margins in addition cancellations of home sales contracts in backlog may increase if homebuyers do not honor their contracts due to any of the factors discussed above 

our financial services business is closely related to our homebuilding business as it originates mortgage loans principally to purchasers of the homes we build a decrease in the demand for our homes because of the foregoing matters will also adversely affect the financial results of this segment of our business an increase in the default rate on the mortgages we originate may adversely affect our ability to sell the mortgages or the pricing we receive upon the sale of mortgages or may increase our recourse obligations for previous originations we establish reserves related to mortgages we have sold however actual future obligations related to these mortgages could differ significantly from our currently estimated amounts 

constriction of the credit markets could limit our ability to access capital and increase our costs of capital 

during much of the recent housing downturn the credit markets constricted and reduced some sources of liquidity that were previously available to us consequently we focused on generating substantial operating cash flow and we relied principally on our cash on hand to meet our working capital needs and repay outstanding indebtedness during those years there likely will be periods in the future when financial market upheaval will increase our cost of capital or limit our ability to access the public debt markets or obtain bank financing 

we have a revolving credit facility which currently provides committed loan financing through september 7 2018  in an amount totaling 725 million  also our mortgage subsidiary uses a 300 million  mortgage repurchase facility to finance many of the loans it originates the mortgage repurchase facility must be renewed annually and currently expires on february 28 2014  we expect to renew and extend the term of the mortgage repurchase facility on similar terms prior to its maturity adverse changes in market conditions could make the renewal of this facility more difficult or could result in an increase in the cost of the facility or a decrease in its committed availability such changes affecting our mortgage repurchase facility may also make it more difficult or costly to sell the mortgages that we originate 

we believe that our existing cash resources our revolving credit facility and our mortgage repurchase facility provide sufficient liquidity to fund our nearterm working capital needs and debt obligations we regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund future growth in our business repay our longerterm debt obligations and support our other general corporate and operational needs and we regularly evaluate our opportunities to raise additional capital as market conditions permit we may issue new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets or obtain additional bank financing to fund our projected capital requirements or provide additional liquidity adverse changes in economic homebuilding or capital market conditions could negatively affect our business liquidity and financial results 

reductions in the availability of mortgage financing and the liquidity provided by governmentsponsored enterprises the effects of government programs a decrease in our ability to sell mortgage loans on attractive terms or an increase in mortgage interest rates could adversely affect our business or financial results 

during the last seven years the mortgage lending industry has experienced significant change and contraction credit requirements have tightened and investor demand for mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities has been predominantly limited to securities backed by fannie mae freddie mac or ginnie mae as a result it is difficult for some potential buyers to finance the purchase of our homes further tightening of credit requirements could adversely affect our business or financial results 

we believe that the liquidity provided by fannie mae freddie mac and ginnie mae to the mortgage industry has been very important to the housing market fannie mae and freddie mac have required substantial injections of capital from the federal government and may require additional government support in the future there has been ongoing discussion by the government with regard to the long term structure and viability of fannie mae and freddie mac these discussions include the downsizing of their portfolios as well as the tightening of guidelines for their loan products in addition increased lending volume and losses insured by the fha have resulted in a reduction of its insurance fund any reduction in the availability of the financing or insuring provided by these institutions could adversely affect interest rates mortgage availability and sales of new homes and mortgage loans the fha insures mortgage loans that generally have lower credit requirements and is an important source for financing the sale of our homes in recent years more restrictive guidelines have been placed on fha insured loans affecting minimum down payment and availability for condominium financing also in recent years the fha has raised the premium charged to borrowers for insuring loans which has increased the cost of fha financing additional future restrictions or premium increases may negatively affect the availability or affordability of fha financing which could adversely affect our ability to sell homes 

while the use of down payment assistance programs by our homebuyers has decreased significantly some of our customers still utilize 100 financing through programs offered by the va and united states department of agriculture usda these governmentsponsored loan programs are subject to changes in regulations lending standards and government funding levels there can be no assurances that these programs or other programs will continue to be available in our homebuilding markets or that they will be as attractive to our customers as the programs currently offered which could negatively affect our sales 

the mortgage loans originated by our financial services operations are generally sold to thirdparty purchasers during fiscal 2013  approximately 44  of our mortgage loans were sold to one major financial institution on an ongoing basis we seek to establish additional loan purchase arrangements with multiple institutions if we are unable to sell mortgage loans to additional purchasers on attractive terms our ability to originate and sell mortgage loans at competitive prices could be limited which would negatively affect our profitability 

even if potential customers do not need financing changes in the availability of mortgage products may make it more difficult for them to sell their current homes to potential buyers who need financing 

mortgage rates are currently low as compared to most historical periods if interest rates increase the costs of owning a home will be affected which could result in a decline in the demand for our homes 

the risks associated with our land and lot inventory could adversely affect our business or financial results 

inventory risks are substantial for our homebuilding business during fiscal 2012 and 2013 we increased our investments in land and lot inventories in response to increased demand for our homes there are risks inherent in controlling owning and developing land if housing demand declines we may not be able to build and sell homes profitably in some of our communities and we may not be able to fully recover the costs of some of the land and lots we own also the values of our owned undeveloped land building lots and housing inventories may fluctuate significantly due to changes in market conditions as a result our deposits for building lots controlled under option or similar contracts may be put at risk we may have to sell homes or land for a lower profit margin or we may have to record inventory impairment charges on our developed and undeveloped land and lots a significant deterioration in economic or homebuilding industry conditions may result in substantial inventory impairment charges 

homebuilding is subject to home warranty and construction defect claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant 

we are subject to home warranty and construction defect claims arising in the ordinary course of our homebuilding business we rely on subcontractors to perform the actual construction of our homes and in many cases to select and obtain construction materials despite our detailed specifications and monitoring of the construction process our subcontractors occasionally use improper construction processes or defective materials in the construction of our homes when we find these issues we repair them in accordance with our warranty obligations we spend significant resources to repair items in homes we have sold to fulfill the warranties we issued to our homebuyers additionally we are subject to construction defect claims which can be costly to defend and resolve in the legal system warranty and construction defect matters can also result in negative publicity in the media and on the internet which can damage our reputation and adversely affect our ability to sell homes 

based on the large number of homes we have sold over the years our potential liabilities related to warranty and construction defect claims are significant as a consequence we maintain product liability insurance and we obtain indemnities and certificates of insurance from subcontractors covering claims related to their workmanship and materials we establish warranty and other reserves for the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built because of the uncertainties inherent to these matters we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will be adequate to address all of our future warranty and construction defect claims contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce we may be responsible for applicable selfinsured retentions and some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits additionally the coverage offered by and the availability of product liability insurance for construction defects is limited and costly we have responded to increases in insurance costs and coverage limitations by increasing our selfinsured retentions and claim reserves there can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted or become more costly if costs to resolve our future warranty and construction defect claims exceed our estimates our financial results and liquidity could be adversely affected 

supply shortages and other risks related to acquiring land building materials and skilled labor could increase our costs and delay deliveries 

the homebuilding industry has from time to time experienced significant difficulties that can affect the cost or timing of 

construction including 

 

these factors may cause us to take longer or incur more costs to build our homes and adversely affect our revenues and margins if the level of new home demand increases significantly in future periods the risk of shortages in residential lots labor and materials available to the homebuilding industry could increase in some markets where we operate 

we are required to obtain performance bonds the unavailability of which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

we often are required to provide surety bonds to secure our performance or obligations under construction contracts development agreements and other arrangements our ability to obtain surety bonds primarily depends upon our credit rating financial condition past performance and other factors including the capacity of the surety market and the underwriting practices of surety bond issuers the ability to obtain surety bonds also can be impacted by the willingness of insurance companies to issue performance bonds for construction and development activities if we are unable to obtain surety bonds when required our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

increases in the costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business or financial results 

significant expenses of owning a home including mortgage interest and real estate taxes generally are deductible expenses for an individual’s federal and in some cases state income taxes subject to various limitations under current tax law and policy if the federal government or a state government changes its income tax laws as has been discussed from time to time to eliminate or substantially modify these income tax deductions the aftertax cost of owning a new home would increase for many of our potential customers the loss or reduction of homeowner tax deductions if such tax law changes were enacted without offsetting provisions could adversely affect demand for and sales prices of new homes 

in addition increases in property tax rates by local governmental authorities as experienced in some areas in response to reduced federal and state funding could adversely affect the amount of financing our potential customers could obtain or their desire to purchase new homes 

governmental regulations and environmental matters could increase the cost and limit the availability of our development and homebuilding projects and adversely affect our business or financial results 

we are subject to extensive and complex regulations that affect land development and home construction including zoning density restrictions building design and building standards these regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities as to the conditions we must meet prior to development or construction being approved if approved at all we are subject to determinations by these authorities as to the adequacy of water or sewage facilities roads or other local services new housing developments may also be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets and other public improvements in addition in many markets government authorities have implemented no growth or growth control initiatives any of these can limit delay or increase the costs of development or home construction 

we are also subject to a significant number and variety of local state and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of health safety labor standards and the environment the impact of environmental laws varies depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available these matters may result in delays may cause us to incur substantial compliance remediation mitigation and other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas government agencies also routinely initiate audits reviews or investigations of our business practices to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations which can cause us to incur costs or create other disruptions in our business that can be significant 

the subcontractors we rely on to perform the actual construction of our homes are also subject to a significant number of local state and federal laws and regulations including laws involving matters that are not within our control if the subcontractors who construct our homes fail to comply with all applicable laws we can suffer reputational damage and may be exposed to possible liability 

we are also subject to an extensive number of laws and regulations because our common stock and debt securities are publicly traded in the capital markets these regulations govern our communications with our shareholders and the capital markets our financial statement disclosures and our legal processes and they also impact the work required to be performed by our independent registered public accounting firm and our legal counsel changes in these laws and regulations including the subsequent implementation of rules by the administering government authorities can require us to incur additional compliance costs and such costs can be significant 

governmental regulation of our financial services operations could adversely affect our business or financial results 

our financial services operations are subject to a significant number of federal state and local laws and regulations any of which may limit our ability to provide mortgage financing or title services to potential purchasers of our homes these include eligibility requirements for participation in federal loan programs compliance with consumer lending laws and other regulations governing disclosure requirements prohibitions against discrimination real estate settlement procedures and foreclosure and servicing policies additionally the turmoil caused by the significant number of defaults and resulting foreclosures during the housing downturn has encouraged consumer lawsuits and the investigation of financial services industry practices by various governmental authorities these governmental inquiries could result in changes in regulations and in the practices of the financial services and homebuilding industries and they could adversely affect the costs and financial results of financial services and homebuilding companies 

in july 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act was enacted to provide for a number of new requirements related to residential mortgage lending practices in 2011 the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb was created to regulate consumer protection with regard to financial products and services in january 2013 the cfpb proposed a number of new rules to become effective in january 2014 including but not limited to rules regarding the creation and definition of a “qualified mortgage” qm rules for lender practices regarding assessing borrowers’ ability to repay and limitations on certain fees and incentive arrangements the effects of these rules upon their adoption could affect the availability and cost of mortgage credit other requirements provided for by the doddfrank act have not yet been finalized or implemented the effect of such provisions on our financial services business will depend on the rules that are ultimately enacted 

we have substantial amounts of consolidated debt and may incur additional debt and our debt obligations and ability to comply with related covenants restrictions or limitations could adversely affect our financial condition 

as of september 30 2013  our consolidated debt was 35090 million  we have 10308 million  principal amount of our debt maturing before the end of fiscal 2014  of which 500 million  is in the form of convertible senior notes that will mature on may 15 2014 and are convertible into approximately 386 million  shares of our common stock at a conversion price of 1296  per share the indentures governing our senior and convertible senior notes impose restrictions on our and our guarantor subsidiaries ability to incur debt secured by certain assets however the indentures do not restrict the incurrence of future unsecured debt by us or our guarantor subsidiaries or the incurrence of debt whether secured or unsecured by our financial services or other nonguarantor subsidiaries additionally the agreement governing our revolving credit facility allows us to incur a substantial amount of future secured and unsecured debt 

possible consequences the amount and the maturities of our debt could have important consequences for example they could 

 

in addition the magnitude of our debt and the restrictions imposed by the instruments governing these obligations expose us to additional risks including 

dependence on future performance our ability to meet our debt service and other obligations and the financial covenants under our revolving credit facility will depend in part upon our future financial performance our future results are subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report our revenues and earnings vary with the level of general economic activity in the markets we serve our businesses are also affected by financial political business and other factors many of which are beyond our control the factors that affect our ability to generate cash can also affect our ability to raise additional funds for these purposes through the sale of debt or equity the refinancing of debt or the sale of assets changes in prevailing interest rates may affect our ability to meet our debt service obligations because borrowings under our revolving credit facility and mortgage repurchase facility bear interest at floating rates 

revolving credit facility our revolving credit facility contains financial covenants requiring the maintenance of a minimum level of tangible net worth a maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and a borrowing base restriction if our ratio of debt to tangible net worth exceeds a certain level a failure to comply with these requirements could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under our revolving credit facility or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity 

mortgage repurchase facility and other restrictions the mortgage repurchase facility for our mortgage subsidiary requires the maintenance of a minimum level of tangible net worth a maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and a minimum level of liquidity by our mortgage subsidiary a failure to comply with these requirements could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds to the mortgage subsidiary or cause their debt to become due and payable prior to maturity any difficulty experienced in complying with these covenants could make the renewal of the facility more difficult or costly 

in addition although our financial services business is conducted through subsidiaries that are not restricted by our indentures the ability of our financial services subsidiaries to provide funds to our homebuilding operations would be restricted in the event such distribution of funds would cause an event of default under the mortgage repurchase facility or if an event of default had occurred under this facility moreover our right to receive assets from these subsidiaries upon their liquidation or recapitalization would be subject to the prior claims of the creditors of these subsidiaries any claims we may have to the funds of our financial services subsidiaries would be subordinate to subsidiary indebtedness to the extent of any security for such indebtedness and to any indebtedness otherwise recognized as senior to our claims 

changes in debt ratings our senior unsecured debt is currently rated at below investment grade any lowering of our debt ratings could make accessing the public capital markets or obtaining additional credit from banks more difficult andor more expensive 

change of control purchase options and change of control default if a change of control occurs as defined in the indentures governing 2838 million  principal amount of our senior notes as of september 30 2013  we would be required to offer to purchase such notes at 101  of their principal amount together with all accrued and unpaid interest if any in addition upon the occurrence of both a change of control and a ratings downgrade event each as defined in the indenture governing 18 billion  principal amount of our senior notes as of september 30 2013  we will be required in certain circumstances to offer to repurchase such notes at 101  of their principal amount together with all accrued and unpaid interest if any if a fundamental change including a change of control occurs as defined in the indenture governing our convertible senior notes which constituted 500 million  principal amount as of september 30 2013  we would be required to offer to purchase such notes at par together with all accrued and unpaid interest if any moreover a change of control as defined in our revolving credit facility would constitute an event of default under our revolving credit facility which could result in the acceleration of any borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility a requirement to cash collateralize all letters of credit outstanding thereunder and the termination of the commitments thereunder if more than 50 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility were accelerated and such acceleration were not rescinded within 30 days an event of default would result under the indentures governing our senior notes entitling holders of at least 25 percent in principal amount of the relevant series of notes then outstanding by notice to us and the trustee to declare all such notes to be due and payable immediately if purchase offers were required under the indentures for such notes or the borrowings under our revolving credit facility or senior notes were accelerated we can give no assurance that we would have sufficient funds to pay the amounts that we would be required to purchase 

homebuilding and financial services are very competitive industries and competitive conditions could adversely affect our business or financial results 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive homebuilders compete not only for homebuyers but also for desirable properties financing raw materials and skilled labor we compete with local regional and national homebuilders often within larger subdivisions designed planned and developed by such homebuilders we also compete with existing home sales foreclosures and rental properties the competitive conditions in the homebuilding industry can negatively affect our sales volumes selling prices and incentive levels reduce our profit margins and cause impairments in the value of our inventory or other assets competition can also affect our ability to acquire suitable land raw materials and skilled labor at acceptable prices or terms or cause delays in the construction of our homes 

our financial services business competes with other title companies and mortgage lenders including national regional and local mortgage banks and other financial institutions some of which are subject to fewer government regulations mortgage lenders who are subject to fewer regulations or have greater access to capital or different lending criteria may be able to offer more attractive financing to potential customers 

our homebuilding and financial services businesses compete with other companies across all industries to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced employees managers and executives competition for the services of these individuals will likely increase as business conditions improve in the homebuilding and financial services industries or in the general economy if we are unable to attract and retain key employees managers or executives our business could be adversely affected 

we cannot make any assurances that our growth strategies or acquisitions will be successful or not expose us to additional risks 

we have primarily focused on internal growth in recent years by increasing our investments in land lot and home inventories in our existing homebuilding markets we have also expanded our business through selected investments in new geographic markets investments in land lots and home inventories can expose us to risks of economic loss and inventory impairments if housing conditions weaken or if we are unsuccessful in implementing our growth strategies 

additionally we acquired the homebuilding operations of one company in fiscal 2012 and another company in october 2013 and we may make strategic acquisitions of other homebuilding companies or their assets in the future such acquisitions have similar risks as our other investments in land lots and home inventories but they also require the integration of the acquired operations and management we can give no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify acquire and integrate strategic acquisitions in the future acquisitions can result in dilution to existing stockholders if we issue our common stock as consideration or reduce our liquidity or increase our debt if we fund them with cash in addition acquisitions can expose us to valuation risks including the risk of writing off goodwill or impairing inventory and other assets related to such acquisitions the risk of goodwill and asset impairments increases during a cyclical housing downturn when our profitability may decline as evidenced by the goodwill and asset impairment charges we recognized during the recent downturn 

our business could be adversely affected by the loss of key personnel 

we rely on our key personnel to effectively operate and manage our homebuilding and financial services businesses specifically our success depends heavily on the performance of our homebuilding division and region presidents and their management teams our financial services management team our corporate office management teams and our executive officers these key personnel have significant experience and skills in the homebuilding and financial services industries as well as leadership and management abilities that are important to our success we seek to have succession plans in the event we lose the services of our key personnel however if we lose the services of key personnel and our succession planning and implementation efforts are unsuccessful our business could be adversely affected 

our business and financial results could be adversely affected by significant inflation or deflation 

inflation can adversely affect us by increasing costs of land materials and labor in addition significant inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates which have a negative impact on housing demand in a highly inflationary environment depending on industry and other economic conditions we may be precluded from raising home prices enough to keep up with the rate of inflation which could reduce our profit margins moreover with inflation the costs of capital increase and the purchasing power of our cash resources can decline current or future efforts by the government to stimulate the economy may increase the risk of significant inflation and its adverse impact on our business or financial results 

alternatively a significant period of deflation could cause a decrease in overall spending and borrowing levels this could lead to a further deterioration in economic conditions including an increase in the rate of unemployment deflation could also cause the value of our inventories to decline or reduce the value of existing homes below the related mortgage loan balance which could potentially increase the supply of existing homes and have a negative impact on our results of operations 

our deferred income tax assets may not be fully realizable 

as of september 30 2013  we had deferred income tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities of 6176 million  against which we provided a valuation allowance of 310 million  the realization of all or a portion of our deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the statutory carryforward periods and in the jurisdictions in which the related temporary differences become deductible we have provided the valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets because it is more likely than not that a portion of our state net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized due to the more limited carryforward periods that exist in certain states the accounting for deferred income taxes is based upon estimates of future results a housing industry downturn or other adverse situations that negatively affect our future taxable income could result in the need for us to record a larger valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position changes in tax laws also affect actual tax results and the valuation of deferred income tax assets specifically a decrease in income tax rates would result in a decrease in our deferred tax assets and a corresponding charge to income tax expense 

information technology failures and data security breaches could harm our business 

we use information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational and marketing activities and to maintain our business records these information technology systems are dependent upon global communications providers web browsers telephone systems and other aspects of the internet infrastructure that have experienced security breaches cyberattacks significant systems failures and electrical outages in the past a material breach in the security of our information technology systems or other data security controls could include the theft or release of customer employee or company data in february 2012 we experienced a software security breach by unknown external sources in our internet loan prequalification system we investigated the breach with the assistance of information technology security experts and with local and federal law enforcement our investigations produced no evidence that any of our customers’ data was actually accessed or exported from our systems a security breach such as the one we experienced a significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems or a breach of any of our data security controls could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers adversely impact our sales and revenue and require us to incur significant expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve these kinds of issues the release of confidential information as a result of a security breach may also lead to litigation or other proceedings against us by affected individuals or business partners or by regulators and the outcome of such proceedings which could include penalties or fines could have a significant negative impact on our business we may also be required to incur significant costs to protect against damages caused by these information technology failures or security breaches in the future we routinely utilize information technology security experts to assist us in our evaluations of the effectiveness of the security of our information technology systems and we regularly enhance our security measures to protect our systems and data however we cannot provide assurances that a security breach cyberattack data theft or other significant systems or security failures will not occur in the future and such occurrences could have a material and adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position

results of operations — fiscal year 2013  overview 

in fiscal 2013  demand for new homes increased in most of our markets as compared to fiscal 2012  while the supply of homes for sale became more limited relative to the increased demand this favorable supply and demand environment resulted in increased sales volume higher average sales and closing prices and improved gross margins in our homebuilding segments compared to the prior year comparing fiscal 2013  to fiscal 2012  the number and value of our net sales orders increased   19  and 37  respectively and the number of homes closed and home sales revenues increased   28  and 43  respectively the average selling price of our homes closed increased   12  and our gross margins on homes closed increased  by 310  basis points in fiscal 2013  as compared to the prior year primarily because favorable market conditions allowed us to increase sales prices or reduce sales incentives in many of our communities pretax income was 6578 million  in fiscal 2013  compared to 2429 million  in fiscal 2012  these results reflect the significant improvement in housing market conditions over the past two years strong operating results from our land lot and housing investments and tight controls of our selling general and administrative sga expenses and interest costs 

after generating strong increases in net sales volume and home prices in fiscal 2012 and in the first half of fiscal 2013 our net sales volume growth moderated in the second half of fiscal 2013 we believe several factors contributed to this moderation including increased mortgage interest rates higher home prices and our efforts to align our sales pace with our construction activities in many of our communities  we believe that increases in mortgage interest rates have a shortterm impact on the timing of new home demand while longterm demand in our individual operating markets is tied more closely to improvement in each markets economy as measured by job growth household incomes household formations and consumer confidence until there is a more robust us economic recovery we expect the level of national new home sales to remain below most historical periods with uneven improvement across our operating markets however the us economy appears to be slowly improving which we expect will allow slow to moderate growth in housing demand in markets where job growth is occurring 

we believe our business is wellpositioned to continue to profitably grow during the housing recovery due to our strong balance sheet and liquidity our finished lot and land position our inventory of available homes and our broad geographic operating base we increased our investments in land lot and home inventories by 21 billion  during fiscal 2013  in response to the increased demand for our homes and improved market conditions and we will continue to adjust our strategies and investments based on housing demand and our performance in each of our markets nevertheless the pace of the housing recovery and our future results could be negatively affected by weakening economic conditions decreases in the level of employment and housing demand decreased home affordability significant increases in mortgage interest rates or tightening of mortgage lending standards 

strategy 

while new home demand improved in most of our markets in fiscal 2012 and 2013 we expect that further improvement in individual markets will be uneven and largely dependent on local economic conditions our operating strategy has positioned us to capitalize on opportunities across our markets we have used our liquidity and balance sheet flexibility to provide the capital to increase our investments in housing and land inventory expand our product offerings geographically expand our operations opportunistically pursue business acquisitions and increase our profitability our operating strategy includes the following initiatives 

 

our operating strategy has continued to produce positive results in fiscal 2013  however we cannot provide any assurances that the initiatives listed above will continue to be successful and we may need to adjust components of our strategy to meet future market conditions we expect that our operating strategy will allow us to increase our profitability while maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity position in fiscal 2014

fiscal year ended september 30 2013  compared to fiscal year ended september 30 2012   

the following tables and related discussion set forth key operating and financial data for our homebuilding operations by reporting segment as of and for the fiscal years ended 2013  and 2012  





 

 27 

net sales orders 

the value of net sales orders increased   37  to 65670 million   25120  homes in 2013  from 48033 million   21048  homes in 2012  with significant increases in five of our six market regions average selling prices increased in all regions and the volume of net sales orders increased in most regions indicating broad improvement in market conditions across our business 

the number of net sales orders increased   19  during 2013  compared to 2012  reflecting the improvement in new home demand and market conditions as well as the effects of investments we have made to expand our operations the largest percentage increase occurred in our southeast region as a result of improved market conditions and our increased inventory investments in our atlanta jacksonville and orlando markets sales orders in our southeast region were also positively impacted by our acquisition of the homebuilding operations of breland homes during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 which contributed 674  net sales orders in 2013  compared to 118  net sales orders in 2012  the decrease in net sales orders in our southwest region was primarily due to sales decreases in our phoenix market as compared to 2012  when significant sales increases occurred in this market our overall net sales volume growth moderated in the second half of the year which we believe is due in part to the impact of recent increases in mortgage interest rates and higher home prices as well as our efforts to align our sales pace with our construction activities in many of our communities our future sales volumes will depend on the strength of the overall economy employment levels and our ability to successfully implement our operating strategies in each of our markets 

the average price of our net sales orders increased   15  to 261400  in 2013  from 228200  in 2012  resulting from our ability to raise sales prices in many of our communities as demand for new homes improved and the relative supply of homes for sale declined in many of our markets a small increase in the average size of our homes sold was also a contributing factor home prices have rebounded sharply in many of our markets and as supply and demand become more balanced we expect our average sales prices to increase at a lower rate in fiscal 2014 

our sales order cancellation rate cancelled sales orders divided by gross sales orders for the period was 24  in both fiscal 2013  and 2012  our cancellation rates in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2013  were 24  and 31  respectively which were higher than the same periods of 2012  as potential buyers adjusted to the impact of higher mortgage interest rates and home prices 



sales order backlog 

sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies including mortgage loan approval and buyers selling their existing homes which can result in cancellations a portion of the contracts in backlog will not result in closings due to cancellations our homes in backlog at september 30 2013   increased   13  from the prior year with more homes in backlog in most regions due to increases in net sales orders as compared with the prior year 



home sales revenue 

revenues from home sales increased 43  to 60248 million   24155  homes closed in 2013  from 42184 million   18890  homes closed in 2012  during the current year home sales revenues increased in all of our market regions resulting from increases in the number of homes closed and increases in average selling prices due to favorable housing market conditions and our increased inventory investments 

the number of homes closed in fiscal 2013  increased 28  from 2012  due to increases in all of our market regions the most significant percentage increase in the current year occurred in our southeast region where the highest percentage increases occurred in the jacksonville orlando southwest florida and atlanta markets and where huntsville was a new market in fiscal 2013  in our west region the highest percentage increases occurred in the southern california portland and las vegas markets 

the average selling price of homes closed during 2013  was 249400  up   12  from the 223300  average in 2012  resulting from our ability to raise sales prices in many of our communities as demand for new homes improved from the prior year and the supply of homes for sale declined in many of our markets also a small increase in the average size of our homes closed was a contributing factor home prices have rebounded sharply in many of our markets and as supply and demand become more balanced we expect our average sales prices to increase at a lower rate in fiscal 2014 

homebuilding operating margin analysis 



home sales gross profit 

gross profit from home sales increased by 68  to 13 billion  in 2013  from 7455 million in 2012  and increased   310 basis points to 208  as a percentage of home sales revenues approximately 210  basis points of the increase in the home sales gross profit percentage resulted from reduced sales incentives and increases in the average selling price of our homes closed partially offset by smaller increases in the average cost of our homes closed reflecting improved market conditions from the prior year approximately 60  basis points of the increase was due to lower costs for warranty and construction defect claims as a percentage of home sales revenue the remaining 40  basis points of the increase was due to a decrease in the amortization of capitalized interest and property taxes as a percentage of home sales revenues resulting from the decrease in interest capitalized as a percentage of our active inventory from the prior year due to a decrease in the average interest rate on our outstanding debt and the growth in our active inventory 

our gross profit margins in fiscal 2013  benefited significantly from favorable market conditions that allowed us to increase sales prices and reduce incentives across most of our markets while we limited increases in construction costs our gross profit margins also benefited from reduced interest amortized to cost of sales as our average borrowing costs benefited from the maturity of some higher interest rate debt combined with the issuance of new debt securities in a period of historically low interest rates as housing supply and demand becomes more balanced we expect our average sales prices to increase at a slower rate while our construction costs could increase also our borrowing costs could increase if the economy improves these factors could cause our gross profit margins in fiscal 2014 to decline from recent levels 

land sales and other revenues 

land sales and other revenues increased to 611 million  in 2013  from 178 million  in 2012  fluctuations in revenues from land sales are a function of how we manage our inventory levels in various markets we generally purchase land and lots with the intent to build and sell homes on them however we occasionally purchase land that includes commercially zoned parcels which we typically sell to commercial developers and we may also sell residential lots or land parcels to manage our land and lot supply land and lot sales occur at unpredictable intervals and varying degrees of profitability therefore the revenues and gross profit from land sales fluctuate from period to period as of september 30 2013  we had 340 million  of land held for sale that we expect to sell in the next twelve months 

revenue from a single longterm construction project for which we served as the general contractor was included in land sales and other revenues revenue from this project was recognized on a percentageofcompletion basis as the construction was completed during fiscal 2013  and 2012  the revenue related to this project was 200 million  and 65 million  respectively and the gross profit was 44 million  and 12 million  respectively 

inventory and land option charges 

during fiscal 2013  we reviewed the performance and outlook for all of our land inventories and communities each quarter for indicators of potential impairment and performed impairment evaluations and analyses when necessary as of september 30 2013  we performed impairment evaluations of communities with a combined carrying value of 1659 million  and determined that communities with carrying values totaling 326 million  were impaired accordingly during the three months ended september 30 2013  we recorded impairment charges of 213 million  to reduce the carrying values of the impaired communities to their estimated fair values during fiscal 2013  and 2012  impairment charges totaled 213 million  and 32 million  respectively 

the overall improvement of housing industry conditions and our increased profitability have significantly reduced the number of our communities and carrying value of inventories that had indicators of potential impairment during the past few years however if we modify our pricing and incentives construction and development plans or land sale strategies in individual communities or if conditions worsen in the broader economy homebuilding industry or specific markets in which we operate we may be required to evaluate additional communities for potential impairment these evaluations could result in additional impairment charges 

during fiscal 2013  and 2012  we wrote off 98 million  and 30 million  respectively of earnest money deposits and land option costs related to land option contracts which are expected to be terminated at september 30 2013  outstanding earnest money deposits associated with our portfolio of land and lot option purchase contracts totaled 424 million  

selling general and administrative sga expense 

sga expense from homebuilding activities increased   23  to 6499 million  in 2013  from 5287 million  in 2012  as a percentage of homebuilding revenues sga expense decreased   180 basis points to 107  in 2013  from 125  in 2012  the improvement in sga expenses as a percentage of revenues is due to an increase in both the volume and the average selling prices of our homes closed combined with our efforts to keep the growth in overhead expenses at a lower level than the growth in home closings volume and revenues 

the largest component of our homebuilding sga expense is employee compensation and related costs which represented 65  and 63  of sga costs in 2013  and 2012  respectively these costs increased  by 27  to 4252 million  in 2013  from 3356 million  in 2012  mainly due to an increase in our number of employees and an increase in the level of incentive compensation related to the significant increases in profitability in the current year as compared to the prior year our homebuilding operations employed approximately 3600  and 2740 employees at september 30 2013  and 2012  respectively 

our homebuilding sga expense as a percentage of revenues can vary significantly between periods depending largely on the fluctuations in revenue profit levels and our stock price our awards of performance based units to executive management are accounted for as liability awards and are measured quarterly with changes in value recorded in compensation expense within sga changes in our stock price and our performance compared to our peer group can cause significant changes in the value of these awards and in our compensation expense during fiscal 2013  and 2012  the compensation expense related to these liability awards was 88 million  and 98 million  respectively we attempt to control our sga costs while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports our expected volume of closings however we cannot make assurances that we will be able to maintain or improve upon the current sga expense as a percentage of revenues 

interest incurred 

comparing fiscal 2013  with fiscal 2012  interest incurred increased   39  to 1728 million  due to a 59   increase  in our average debt interest incurred in the current year increased by a lower percentage than the increase in our average debt due to new debt issued at lower interest rates and the maturity of higher interest rate debt both of which reduced our average interest rate as compared to the prior year 

we capitalize interest costs incurred to inventory during active development and construction active inventory capitalized interest is charged to cost of sales as the related inventory is delivered to the buyer in recent years our active inventory has been lower than our debt level and therefore a portion of the interest incurred was reflected as interest expense however during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2013 our active inventory exceeded our debt level and therefore all interest incurred during those periods was capitalized to inventory as a result 71 million  of interest was expensed during fiscal 2013  compared to 269 million  during 2012  interest amortized to cost of sales declined  to 23  of total home and landlot and other cost of sales in fiscal 2013  from 27  in fiscal 2012  as a result of a decrease in interest capitalized as a percentage of our active inventory from the prior year due to the decrease in the average interest rate on our outstanding debt and the growth in our active inventory 

other income 

other income net of other expenses included in our homebuilding operations was 149 million  in 2013  compared to 121 million  in 2012  other income consists of interest income rental income income from insurance related activities income associated with other incomeproducing assets and various other types of ancillary income and losses not directly associated with our core homebuilding operations the activities that result in this ancillary income or loss are not significant either individually or in the aggregate 

acquisitions 

in august 2012 we acquired the homebuilding operations of breland homes for 1059 million  in cash of which 94 million  was paid in fiscal 2013 breland homes operates in huntsville and mobile in alabama and along the coast of mississippi the assets acquired primarily included approximately 300  homes in inventory 1000  finished lots and control of approximately 3700  additional lots through option contracts we also acquired a sales order backlog of 228  homes valued at 469 million  the acquisition of the homebuilding operations of breland homes was not material to our results of operations or financial condition 

in october 2013  we acquired the homebuilding operations of regent homes inc for an estimated 35 million  in cash regent homes operates in charlotte greensboro and winstonsalem north carolina the assets acquired included approximately 240  homes in inventory 300  lots and control of approximately 600  additional lots through option contracts we also acquired a sales order backlog of 213  homes valued at 311 million

financial services operating margin analysis 



 

 

mortgage loan activity 

the volume of loans originated and brokered by our mortgage operations is directly related to the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations in fiscal 2013  total firstlien loans originated or brokered by dhi mortgage for our homebuyers increased  by 20  due to an increase  of 28  in the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations the percentage increase in loans originated was lower than the percentage increase in the number of homes closed due to a slight decrease in our mortgage capture rate the percentage of total home closings by our homebuilding operations for which dhi mortgage handled the homebuyers’ financing to 56  in fiscal 2013  from 59  in fiscal 2012  

home closings from our homebuilding operations constituted 86  of dhi mortgage loan originations in 2013  compared to 84  in 2012  these rates reflect dhi mortgage’s consistent focus on the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations 

the number of loans sold increased  by 16  in 2013  compared to 2012  corresponding to the 17   increase  in the number of loans originated virtually all of the mortgage loans originated during fiscal 2013  and mortgage loans held for sale on september 30 2013  were eligible for sale to the federal national mortgage association fannie mae federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac or government national mortgage association ginnie mae approximately 44  of the mortgage loans sold by dhi mortgage during fiscal 2013  were sold to one major financial institution on an ongoing basis we seek to broaden our loan sale alternatives and capacity by establishing additional loan sale arrangements with multiple institutions if we are unable to maintain a sufficient number of loan sale arrangements on attractive terms our ability or capacity to originate and sell mortgage loans at competitive prices could be limited which would negatively affect profitability 

financial services revenues and expenses 

revenues from the financial services segment increased   47  to 1734 million  in fiscal 2013  from 1178 million  in fiscal 2012  the volume of loans sold increased   16  while revenues from the sale of servicing rights and gains from sale of mortgages increased   52  loan sale revenue increased at a higher rate than loan sale volume primarily due to a more competitive marketplace among loan purchasers resulting in an improved execution in the secondary market as well as an increase in the average loan amount due to an increase in the sales prices of homes closed by our homebuilding operations loan origination fees increased   13  corresponding to increases  in the number of loans originated of 17  

charges related to recourse obligations were 05 million  in fiscal 2013  compared to 47 million  in fiscal 2012  our loss reserve for loan recourse obligations is estimated based upon an analysis of loan repurchase requests received our actual repurchases and losses through the disposition of such loans or requests discussions with our mortgage purchasers and analysis of the mortgages we originated while we believe that we have adequately reserved for losses on known and projected repurchase requests if actual repurchase volume or actual losses incurred resolving those repurchases exceed our expectations additional recourse expense may be incurred 

financial services general and administrative ga expense increased   36  to 1164 million  in 2013  from 855 million  in 2012  as a percentage of financial services revenues excluding the effects of recourse and reinsurance expense ga expense was 669  in 2013  compared to 690  in 2012  fluctuations in financial services ga expense as a percentage of revenues can be expected to occur as some expenses are not directly related to mortgage loan volume or to changes in the amount of revenue earned 

results of operations — consolidated 

fiscal year ended september 30 2013  compared to fiscal year ended september 30 2012 

income before income taxes 

income before income taxes for fiscal 2013  was 6578 million  compared to 2429 million  for fiscal 2012  the difference in our operating results for the current year compared to a year ago is due to higher revenues from increased home closings and sales of mortgage loans and higher profit margins in both our homebuilding and financial services businesses 

income taxes 

our income tax expense in fiscal 2013  was 1951 million  compared to a benefit of 7134 million  in 2012  the effective tax rate in fiscal 2013  was 297  we did not have a meaningful effective tax rate in fiscal 2012  because our net deferred tax assets were fully offset by a valuation allowance until the third quarter of fiscal 2012 when we significantly reduced the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 

at september 30 2013  and 2012  we had deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities of 6176 million  and 7514 million  respectively offset by valuation allowances of 310 million  and 419 million  respectively at september 30 2013  we had tax benefits of 993 million  for state net operating loss nol carryforwards that expire beginning at various times depending on the tax jurisdiction from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2032 we also had state tax credit carryforwards of 40 million  that will expire from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2023 and 19 million  of state tax credit carryforwards have no expiration date 

when assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income in future periods we record a valuation allowance when we determine it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized at june 30 2012 we determined it was more likely than not that the substantial majority of our deferred tax assets would be realized which resulted in a 7532 million  reversal of all of the valuation allowance related to our federal deferred tax assets and a portion of the valuation allowance related to our state deferred tax assets during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2012 

further changes in the valuation allowance were recorded during fiscal 2013  based on our quarterly evaluations to determine the need for a valuation allowance related to our state deferred tax assets at march 31 2013 after considering the impact of significantly improving profits from operations we concluded it was more likely than not that we would realize more of our deferred tax assets related to state nol carryforwards than previously anticipated we based this conclusion on additional positive evidence related to the actual pretax profits achieved during the six months ended march 31 2013 and higher levels of forecasted profitability for the remainder of fiscal 2013  and in future years we expected these increased profits to result in a greater realization of our nol carryforwards in certain states before they expire than previously estimated accordingly at march 31 2013 we reduced the valuation allowance on our state deferred tax assets by 187 million  to a balance of 232 million  because this reduction of the valuation allowance was recognized in an interim period a portion of the valuation allowance to be reversed was allocated to the remaining interim periods therefore we reversed an additional 29 million  of the valuation allowance in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2013  additionally approximately 132 million  of our valuation allowance was attributable to state nol carryforwards that expired at the end of fiscal 2013  at which time the related unrealized deferred tax assets and valuation allowances were written off the amount of our valuation allowance at september 30 2013  as a result of the activity described above would have been 71 million  

at september 30 2013  we recorded an outofperiod adjustment which increased both our deferred income taxes and the valuation allowance on our deferred income taxes by 239 million  the outofperiod adjustment had no impact on our statement of operations during fiscal 2013  the increase in our deferred income taxes of 239 million  corrected an error in recording the future benefits for state nol carryforwards based on each of our legal entities’ nols in each state and the current tax rate of each state the valuation allowance was also increased by 239 million  because we determined it is more likely than not that these state nol carryforwards will not be realized because we estimate we will not have sufficient taxable income within these states carryforward periods as a result of this adjustment the remaining amount of the valuation allowance related to state deferred tax assets was 310 million  at september 30 2013  our valuation allowance is based on an analysis of the amount of nol carryforwards associated with each of our legal entities in the states in which we conduct business as 

compared to our expected level of taxable income under existing apportionment or recognition rules in each state and the carryforward periods allowed in each states tax code had deferred income taxes related to the state nol carryforwards of each of our legal entities been reflected at state specific tax rates as of september 30 2012  our deferred income taxes would have increased by 316 million  and the corresponding valuation allowance on our deferred income taxes would have increased by 376 million  this would have resulted in a decrease in our income tax benefit of 60 million  in fiscal 2012  which would have reversed and decreased our income tax expense by 60 million  in fiscal 2013  the unadjusted amounts from fiscal 2012  are not material to our financial statements for fiscal 2012  and the outofperiod adjustment recorded in fiscal 2013  is not material to the current fiscal year’s financial statements 

the accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future results could result in changes in our estimates of the valuation of our deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances and could also have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position also changes in existing federal and state tax laws and tax rates could affect future tax results and the valuation of our deferred tax assets 

unrecognized tax benefits are the differences between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefits recognized for accounting purposes the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was 42 million  and 141 million  at september 30 2013  and 2012  respectively included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at september 30 2013  and 2012  are tax benefits of 27 million  and 118 million  respectively that if recognized would reduce our income tax expense also included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at september 30 2013  and 2012  are tax benefits of 15 million  and 23 million  respectively that if recognized would result in an adjustment to deferred income taxes 

we classify interest expense and penalties on income taxes as income tax expense during fiscal 2013  and 2012  we recognized interest benefits related to unrecognized tax benefits of 28 million  and 01 million  respectively in our consolidated statements of operations at september 30 2013  and 2012  our total accrued interest expense relating to unrecognized tax benefits was 22 million  and 51 million  respectively and there were no  accrued penalties 

a reduction of 42 million  in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits and 22 million  of accrued interest is reasonably possible within the next 12 months of which 41 million  would be reflected as an income tax benefit in the consolidated statement of operations and 23 million  would result in an adjustment to deferred income taxes 

we are subject to federal income tax and to income tax in multiple states the statute of limitations for our major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for fiscal years 2010 through 2013 we are currently being audited by various states 

the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was signed into law on january 2 2013 and did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

results of operations — homebuilding 

fiscal year ended september 30 2012  compared to fiscal year ended september 30 2011   

the following tables and related discussion set forth key operating and financial data for our homebuilding operations by reporting segment as of and for the fiscal years ended september 30 2012  and 2011  





 

 

net sales orders 

the value of net sales orders increased   29  to 48033 million   21048  homes in 2012  from 37276 million   17421  homes in 2011  the number of net sales orders increased   21  in fiscal 2012  compared to fiscal 2011  reflecting an increase in sales demand for our homes while the improvement in our sales reflected improvement in new home demand and market conditions overall demand for new homes remained at a historically low level 

in comparing fiscal 2012  to fiscal 2011  the volume of net sales orders increased in all six of our market regions the largest percentage increases occurred in our southeast and southwest regions as a result of improved market conditions in the majority of our florida markets and in our phoenix market sales orders in our southeast region were also positively impacted by our acquisition of the homebuilding operations of breland homes during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 which added 118  homes and 243 million  to our net sales in fiscal 2012 subsequent to the acquisition date changes in the value of net sales orders were generally due to the change in the number of homes sold in each respective region and to a lesser extent to increases in the average selling price of those homes reflective of the improved market conditions 

the average price of our net sales orders increased 7  to 228200  in 2012  from 214000  in 2011  the increase reflected slight increases in the average size and amenity levels of our homes sold as well as small price increases we were able to implement in some of our communities as demand for new homes improved 

our sales order cancellation rate was 24  in fiscal 2012  compared to 27  in fiscal 2011  while our cancellation rates improved they remained slightly higher than they were prior to the housing downturn and were mainly reflective of tight mortgage lending standards and weaker economic conditions 



sales order backlog 

our homes in backlog at september 30 2012  increased 49  from the prior year with significant increases in most regions due to increases in net sales orders as compared with the prior year the sales order backlog in the southeast region at september 30 2012  included the impact of our acquisition of the homebuilding operations of breland homes during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 



home sales revenue 

revenues from home sales increased   19  to 42184 million   18890  homes closed in 2012  from 35423 million   16695  homes closed in 2011  the average selling price of homes closed during 2012  was 223300  up   5  from the 212200  average in 2011  reflecting slight increases in the average size and amenity levels of our homes closed as well as small price increases we were able to implement in some of our communities as demand for new homes improved during fiscal 2012  home sales revenues increased in all of our market regions resulting from increases in the number of homes closed and increases in average selling prices 

  

the number of homes closed in fiscal 2012   increased   13  from 2011  due to increases in all of our market regions the most significant percentage increase in fiscal 2012  occurred in our southeast region with the florida markets contributing the most to the increase home closings in the southeast region also benefited from our acquisition of the homebuilding operations of breland homes during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 which added 114  home closings and 224 million  to our home sales revenue in fiscal 2012 subsequent to the acquisition date 



home sales gross profit 

gross profit from home sales increased  by 30  to 7455 million  in 2012  from 5713 million  in 2011  and increased   160 basis points to 177  as a percentage of home sales revenues approximately 130  basis points of the increase in the home sales gross profit percentage was a result of the average selling price of our homes increasing by more than the average cost reflecting improved market conditions from the prior year approximately 40  basis points of the increase was due to a decrease in the amortization of capitalized interest and property taxes as a percentage of homes sales revenues resulting from reductions in our interest and property taxes incurred and capitalized and more closings occurring on recently acquired finished lots these increases were partially offset by a 10  basis point decrease due to a 53 million outofperiod adjustment in the prior year period related to an error in recording the loss reserves of our 100 owned captive insurance subsidiary that increased gross profit in 2011 

land sales and other revenues 

land sales and other revenues increased to 178 million  in 2012  from 73 million  in 2011  fiscal 2012  land sales and other revenues included revenue from a single longterm construction project for which we served as the general contractor revenue from this project was recognized on a percentageofcompletion basis as the construction was completed during fiscal 2012  the revenue and gross profit related to this project was 65 million  and 12 million  respectively 

inventory and land option charges 

as of september 30 2012  we evaluated communities with a combined carrying value of 2169 million  for impairment through this evaluation process we determined that communities with carrying values totaling 18 million  as of september 30 2012  were impaired accordingly during the three months ended september 30 2012  we recorded impairment charges of 06 million  to reduce the carrying values of the impaired communities to their estimated fair values during fiscal 2012  and 2011  impairment charges totaled 32 million  and 373 million  respectively 

during fiscal 2012  and 2011  we wrote off 30 million  and 81 million  respectively of earnest money deposits and costs related to land option contracts the inventory impairment charges and writeoffs of earnest money deposits and land option costs reduced total homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding revenues by approximately 10 basis points in fiscal 2012  compared to 130  basis points in fiscal 2011  

selling general and administrative sga expense 

sga expense from homebuilding activities increased   10  to 5287 million  in 2012  from 4800 million  in 2011  as a percentage of homebuilding revenues sga expense decreased   100 basis points to 125  in 2012  from 135  in 2011  the largest component of our homebuilding sga expense was employee compensation and related costs which represented 63  and 60  of sga costs in 2012  and 2011  respectively these costs increased  by 17  to 3356 million  in 2012  from 2865 million  in 2011  primarily due to an increase in the level of incentive compensation related to the significant increases in revenues profitability and the price of our common stock in 2012  as compared to 2011  our homebuilding operations employed approximately 2740  and 2380 employees at september 30 2012  and 2011  respectively 

interest incurred 

comparing fiscal 2012  with fiscal 2011  interest incurred decreased   6  to 1241 million  primarily due to a 4   decrease  in our average debt we expensed 269 million  of interest during fiscal 2012  compared to 519 million  of interest during fiscal 2011  the reduction in interest expensed is a result of an increase in our inventory under active development and construction as well as the decline in interest incurred interest amortized to cost of sales declined  to 27  of total home and landlot and other cost of sales in fiscal 2012  from 30  in 2011  as a result of more home closings on acquired finished lots and decreases in construction times 

gainloss on early retirement of debt 

during fiscal 2012  we retired 108 million  principal amount of our senior notes prior to their maturity during fiscal 2011  in addition to repaying 1762 million  principal amount of maturing senior notes we retired 3192 million  principal amount of our senior notes prior to their maturity as a result of the early retirement of these notes we recognized a net gain of 01 million  and a net loss of 108 million  in fiscal 2012  and 2011  respectively these amounts represent the difference between the principal amount of the notes and the aggregate purchase price after the writeoff of any unamortized discounts and fees 

other income 

other income net of other expenses included in our homebuilding operations was 121 million  in 2012  compared to 80 million  in 2011  the largest component of other income in both years was interest income 

acquisitions 

in august 2012 we acquired the homebuilding operations of breland homes for 1059 million  in cash of which 94 million  was paid in fiscal 2013 breland homes operates in huntsville and mobile in alabama and along the coast of mississippi the assets acquired primarily included approximately 300  homes in inventory 1000  finished lots and control of approximately 3700  additional lots through option contracts we also acquired a sales order backlog of 228  homes valued at 469 million  the acquisition of the homebuilding operations of breland homes was not material to our results of operations or financial condition

financial services operating margin analysis 



 

 46 

mortgage loan activity 

in fiscal 2012  total firstlien loans originated or brokered by dhi mortgage for our homebuyers increased by 9  reflective of the 13  increase in the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations the percentage increase in loans originated was lower than the percentage increase in the number of homes closed due to a slight decrease in our mortgage capture rate to 59  in fiscal 2012  from 61  in fiscal 2011  

home closings from our homebuilding operations constituted 84  of dhi mortgage loan originations in 2012  compared to 85  in 2011  reflecting dhi mortgage’s continued focus on the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations 

the number of loans sold increased by 13  in 2012  compared to 2011  corresponding to the 11  increase in the number of loans originated between the years virtually all of the mortgage loans originated during fiscal 2012  and mortgage loans held for sale on september 30 2012  were eligible for sale to fannie mae freddie mac or ginnie mae approximately 73  of the mortgage loans sold by dhi mortgage during fiscal 2012  were sold to one major financial institution that provided better pricing and execution than other available loan purchasers 

financial services revenues and expenses 

revenues from the financial services segment increased 35  to 1178 million  in fiscal 2012  from 872 million  in fiscal 2011  the volume of loans sold increased 13  while revenues from the sale of servicing rights and gains from sale of mortgages increased 39  loan sale revenue increased at a higher rate than loan sale volume primarily due to improved loan sale execution in the secondary market loan origination fees increased 3  compared to an 11  increase in the number of loans originated the percentage increase in loan origination fees was lower than the percentage increase in the number of loans originated due to pricing changes in some of our markets and was generally offset by improved loan sale execution charges related to recourse obligations were 47 million  in fiscal 2012  compared to 116 million  in fiscal 2011

results of operations — consolidated 

fiscal year ended september 30 2012  compared to fiscal year ended september 30 2011   

income before income taxes 

income before income taxes for fiscal 2012  was 2429 million  compared to 121 million  for fiscal 2011  the difference in our operating results for 2012  compared to 2011  is primarily due to higher revenues from increased home closings a higher gross profit margin and lower interest expense 

income taxes 

in fiscal 2012  our income tax benefit was 7134 million  compared to a benefit of 597 million  in 2011  the income tax benefit in fiscal 2012  was due primarily to a significant reduction of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance during the three months ended june 30 2012 the income tax benefit in fiscal 2011  was due to us receiving a favorable result from the internal revenue service irs on a ruling request concerning capitalization of inventory costs we did not have meaningful effective tax rates in those years because our net deferred tax assets were fully offset by a valuation allowance until the third quarter of fiscal 2012 when we significantly reduced the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 

at september 30 2012  and 2011  we had income taxes receivable of 144 million  and 124 million  respectively we had deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities of 7514 million  and 8485 million  respectively offset by valuation allowances of 419 million  and 8485 million  respectively 

at september 30 2012  and 2011  the total amount of our unrecognized tax benefits was 141 million  and 163 million  respectively related to unrecognized tax benefits we recognized an interest benefit of 01 million  and 127 million  during fiscal 2012  and 2011  respectively at both september 30 2012  and 2011  our total accrued interest expense relating to unrecognized tax benefits was 51 million  and there were no  accrued penalties 

overview of capital resources and liquidity 

we have historically funded our homebuilding and financial services operations with cash flows from operating activities borrowings under bank credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities our current levels of cash borrowing capacity and balance sheet leverage provide us with the operational flexibility to adjust to homebuilding market conditions in response to improved market conditions and increased demand for our homes in fiscal 2013  we increased our investments in homes finished lots land and land development to expand our operations and grow our profitability we intend to maintain adequate liquidity and balance sheet strength and we regularly evaluate opportunities to access the capital markets 

at september 30 2013  our ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital was 446  compared to 391  at september 30 2012  the increase in our ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital reflects the issuance of 11 billion  of senior notes in fiscal 2013  partially offset by an increase in equity from net income earned during the year our ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital homebuilding notes payable net of cash and marketable securities divided by homebuilding notes payable net of cash and marketable securities plus total equity was 367  at september 30 2013  compared to 214  at september 30 2012  which reflects the increase in our debt and the investment of our cash into homebuilding inventories we intend to maintain our ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital within or below a range of 40  to 45  over the long term but we may choose to operate above this range for shortterm periods therefore future net homebuilding debt to total capital ratios may be higher than the current level 

we believe that the ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital is useful in understanding the leverage employed in our homebuilding operations and comparing our capital structure with other homebuilders because of their capital function we include our homebuilding cash and marketable securities as a reduction of our homebuilding debt and total capital we exclude the debt of our financial services business because it is separately capitalized and its obligation under its repurchase agreement is substantially collateralized and not guaranteed by our parent company or any of our homebuilding entities 

we believe that our existing cash resources our revolving credit facility and our mortgage repurchase facility provide sufficient liquidity to fund our nearterm working capital needs and debt obligations we regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund future growth in our business repay our future debt obligations and support our other general corporate and operational needs and we regularly evaluate our opportunities to raise additional capital we have an automatically effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec in september 2012 registering debt and equity securities which we may issue from time to time in amounts to be determined as market conditions permit we may issue new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets or obtain additional bank financing to fund our projected capital requirements or provide additional liquidity 

homebuilding capital resources 

cash and cash equivalents  — at september 30 2013  our homebuilding cash and cash equivalents were 9133 million  

  bank credit facility  — we have a senior unsecured revolving credit facility which was amended in august 2013 to increase its capacity from 600 million  to 725 million  and to extend its maturity date to september 7 2018  the facility has an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to 10 billion  subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments the facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit letters of credit issued under the facility reduce available borrowing capacity and may total no more than 3625 million  in the aggregate the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be based on either the prime rate or london interbank offered rate libor plus an applicable margin as defined in the credit agreement governing the facility at september 30 2013  there were no  borrowings outstanding and 616 million  of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility 

our revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on our operations and activities including requiring the maintenance of a minimum level of tangible net worth a maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and a borrowing base restriction if our ratio of debt to tangible net worth exceeds a certain level these covenants are measured as defined in the credit agreement governing the facility and are reported to the lenders quarterly a failure to comply with these financial covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under the revolving credit facility or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity in addition the credit agreement governing the facility imposes restrictions on the creation of secured debt and liens at september 30 2013  we were in compliance with all of the covenants limitations and restrictions of our revolving credit facility 

secured letter of credit agreements  — we have secured letter of credit agreements which require us to deposit cash in an amount approximating the balance of letters of credit outstanding as collateral with the issuing banks the amount of cash restricted for letters of credit issued under these agreements totaled 85 million  and 462 million  at september 30 2013  and 2012  respectively and is included in homebuilding restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheets 

public unsecured debt — in february 2013  we issued 400 million  principal amount of 3625 senior notes due february 15 2018  and 300 million  principal amount of 475 senior notes due february 15 2023  in august 2013  we issued 400 million  principal amount of 575 senior notes due august 15 2023  the annual effective interest rates of the 3625 senior notes 475 senior notes and 575 senior notes after giving effect to the amortization of financing costs are 38  49  and 59  respectively the indentures governing our senior notes impose restrictions on the creation of secured debt and liens at september 30 2013  we were in compliance with all of the limitations and restrictions that form a part of the public debt obligations 

on may 1 2013 we repaid the remaining 1717 million  principal amount of our 6875 senior notes which were due on that date we have 7838 million  principal amount of our senior notes maturing before the end of fiscal 2014  of which 500 million  is in the form of convertible senior notes that will mature on may 15 2014  and are convertible into approximately 386 million  shares of our common stock at a conversion price of 1296  per share if the convertible senior notes are eligible for conversion at maturity we may redeem them with cash shares of our common stock or a combination thereof at our election 

debt and equity repurchase authorizations  — effective august 1 2013  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 500 million  of debt securities and 100 million  of our common stock effective through july 31 2014  the full amount of each of these authorizations was remaining at september 30 2013  

financial services capital resources 

cash and cash equivalents  — at september 30 2013  our financial services cash and cash equivalents were 232 million  

mortgage repurchase facility  — our mortgage subsidiary dhi mortgage has a mortgage repurchase facility that is accounted for as a secured financing the mortgage repurchase facility provides financing and liquidity to dhi mortgage by facilitating purchase transactions in which dhi mortgage transfers eligible loans to the counterparties against the transfer of funds by the counterparties thereby becoming purchased loans dhi mortgage then has the right and obligation to repurchase the purchased loans upon their sale to thirdparty purchasers in the secondary market or within specified time frames from 45 to 120 days in accordance with the terms of the mortgage repurchase facility in march 2013 the mortgage repurchase facility was renewed and amended and new commitments from banks were obtained which increased the total capacity of the facility to 300 million  the facilitys capacity can be increased to 400 million  subject to the availability of additional commitments the maturity date of the facility is february 28 2014  

as of september 30 2013  3511 million  of mortgage loans held for sale with a collateral value of 3299 million  were pledged under the mortgage repurchase facility as a result of advance paydowns totaling 913 million  dhi mortgage had an obligation of 2386 million  outstanding under the mortgage repurchase facility at september 30 2013  at a 28  annual interest rate 

the mortgage repurchase facility is not guaranteed by either dr horton inc or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt the facility contains financial covenants as to the mortgage subsidiary’s minimum required tangible net worth its maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and its minimum required liquidity these covenants are measured and reported monthly at september 30 2013  dhi mortgage was in compliance with all of the conditions and covenants of the mortgage repurchase facility 

in the past our mortgage subsidiary has been able to renew or extend its mortgage credit facility on satisfactory terms prior to its maturity and obtain temporary additional commitments through amendments to the credit agreement during periods of higher than normal volumes of mortgages held for sale the liquidity of our financial services business depends upon its continued ability to renew and extend the mortgage repurchase facility or to obtain other additional financing in sufficient capacities 

operating cash flow activities 

in fiscal 2013  we used 12 billion  of cash in our operating activities compared to 2934 million  in fiscal 2012  this use of cash compared to the prior year reflects our significant inventory investments during the current fiscal year as we responded to improved market conditions and increased housing demand by expanding our operations in desirable markets we used 8153 million  of cash to increase our construction in progress and finished home inventory compared to 2754 million  in fiscal 2012  we used 12 billion  of cash to increase our residential land and lot inventory through purchases of land and finished lots and increased land development activity compared to 3710 million  in fiscal 2012  the most significant sources of cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2013  were net income an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities 

investing cash flow activities 

in fiscal 2013  net cash provided by investing activities was 1809 million  compared to 1430 million  used in investing activities in fiscal 2012  the primary source of investing cash flows during fiscal 2013  was the receipt of proceeds from the sale or maturity of all of our remaining marketable securities which totaled 2965 million  net of purchases in fiscal 2012  proceeds from and purchases of marketable securities were largely offsetting cash flows in fiscal 2012  were used for the purchase of the homebuilding operations of breland homes whereby 965 million  of the purchase price was paid in that year compared to 94 million  paid to complete the purchase in fiscal 2013  the increase in restricted cash during fiscal 2013  was primarily due to an increase in the balance of our outstanding letters of credit while there was not such an increase during fiscal 2012  we used 580 million  and 336 million  in fiscal 2013  and 2012  respectively to purchase property and equipment including model home furniture office and technology equipment and office buildings to support our operations additionally we paid 186 million  in fiscal 2013  to purchase defaulted debt securities collateralized by one residential real estate parcel and have subsequently received principal payments of 14 million  related to these securities 

financing cash flow activities 

we expect the shortterm financing needs of our operations will be funded with existing cash cash generated from profits and borrowings available under our homebuilding and financial services credit facilities longterm financing needs for the growth of our operations have historically been funded with the issuance of senior unsecured debt securities through the public capital markets 

in fiscal 2013  financing activities provided 9390 million  of cash consisting primarily of note proceeds partially offset by repayments of notes payable and payments of cash dividends proceeds from notes payable of 13 billion  included our issuance of a total of 11 billion  principal amount of senior notes draws of 1650 million  on the revolving credit facility and borrowings of 508 million  under our mortgage repurchase facility note repayments of 3451 million  included the maturity of the 1717 million  principal amount of our 6875 senior notes and repayment of the 1650 million  drawn on the revolving credit facility during fiscal 2012  financing activities provided 7515 million  of cash primarily from our issuance of a total of 700 million  principal amount of senior notes and our borrowings of 713 million  under our mortgage repurchase facility 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2013  the board of directors approved total cash dividends of 01875  per common share which included cash dividends of 00375  per share and 015  per share paid on december 17 2012  and december 21 2012  respectively the cash dividend of 015  per share was in lieu of and accelerated the payment of all quarterly dividends that would have otherwise been paid in calendar year 2013  cash dividends of 00375  per share were declared and paid in each quarter of fiscal 2012  the declaration of future cash dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon among other things future earnings cash flows capital requirements our financial condition and general business conditions 

in accordance with the indenture governing the 2 convertible senior notes due 2014 when cash dividends are paid in excess of 00375  per share in any fiscal quarter the conversion rate related to these notes increases as a result of the cash dividend of 015  per share which was paid on december 21 2012  the conversion rate of the 2 convertible senior notes increased from 765697  to 7718004  shares of our common stock per 1000  principal amount of senior notes the new conversion rate is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately 1296  per share of common stock compared to the initial conversion price of 1306  per share if all of the 2 convertible senior notes due 2014 were converted into our common stock we would issue 386 million  shares of common stock as a result of the conversion 

contractual cash obligations commercial commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

our primary contractual cash obligations for our homebuilding and financial services segments are payments under our debt agreements and lease payments under operating leases we expect to fund our contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business through a combination of our existing cash resources cash flows generated from profits our homebuilding and financial services credit facilities or other bank financing and the issuance of new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets as market conditions may permit 

our future cash requirements for contractual obligations as of september 30 2013  are presented below 



 

 

at september 30 2013  our homebuilding operations had outstanding letters of credit of 701 million  all of which were cash collateralized and surety bonds of 7045 million  issued by third parties to secure performance under various contracts we expect that our performance obligations secured by these letters of credit and bonds will generally be completed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms when we complete our performance obligations the related letters of credit and bonds are generally released shortly thereafter leaving us with no continuing obligations we have no material thirdparty guarantees 

our mortgage subsidiary enters into various commitments related to the lending activities of our mortgage operations further discussion of these commitments is provided in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” under part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts to acquire land or lots for the construction of homes lot option contracts enable us to control significant lot positions with limited capital investment and substantially reduce the risks associated with land ownership and development among our land and lot option purchase contracts at september 30 2013  there were a limited number of contracts representing 201 million  of remaining purchase price subject to specific performance clauses which may require us to purchase the land or lots upon the land sellers meeting their obligations further information about our land option contracts is provided in the “inventories land and lot position and homes in inventory” section included herein 

seasonality 

although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again in the future we generally have more homes under construction close more homes and have greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year the seasonal activity increases our working capital requirements for our homebuilding operations during our third and fourth fiscal quarters and increases our funding requirements for the mortgages we originate in our financial services segment at the end of these quarters as a result of seasonal activity our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year 

inflation 

we may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation primarily because of higher land financing labor and material construction costs in addition higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers we attempt to pass through to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices however during periods when housing market conditions are challenging we may not be able to offset our cost increases with higher selling prices

critical accounting policies 

general  — a comprehensive enumeration of the significant accounting policies of dr horton inc and subsidiaries is presented in note a  to the accompanying financial statements as of september 30 2013  and 2012  and for the years ended september 30 2013  2012  and 2011  each of our accounting policies has been chosen based upon current authoritative literature that collectively comprises us generally accepted accounting principles gaap in instances where alternative methods of accounting are permissible under gaap we have chosen the method that most appropriately reflects the nature of our business the results of our operations and our financial condition and have consistently applied those methods over each of the periods presented in the financial statements the audit committee of our board of directors has reviewed and approved the accounting policies selected 

revenue recognition  — we generally recognize homebuilding revenue and related profit at the time of the closing of a sale when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer in situations where the buyer’s financing is originated by dhi mortgage our 100 owned mortgage subsidiary and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment the profit is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a thirdparty purchaser has been completed any profit on land sales is deferred until the full accrual method criteria are met when appropriate revenue and profit on longterm construction projects are recognized under the percentageofcompletion method 

we include proceeds from home closings held for our benefit at title companies in homebuilding cash when we execute sales contracts with our homebuyers or when we require advance payment from homebuyers for custom changes upgrades or options related to their homes we record the cash deposits received as liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are canceled we either retain or refund to the homebuyer deposits on canceled sales contracts depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances 

we recognize financial services revenues associated with our title operations as closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued both of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed we transfer substantially all underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies to thirdparty insurers we typically elect the fair value option for our mortgage loan originations mortgage loans held for sale are initially recorded at fair value based on either sale commitments or current market quotes and are adjusted for subsequent changes in fair value until the loans are sold net origination costs and fees associated with mortgage loans are recognized at the time of origination the expected net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of a loan are included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings at the time of commitment we generally sell the mortgages we originate and the related servicing rights to thirdparty purchasers interest income is earned from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold 

some mortgage loans are sold with limited recourse provisions which can result in repurchases of loans previously sold to investors or payments to reimburse investors for loan losses based on historical experience discussions with our mortgage purchasers analysis of the mortgages we originated and current housing and credit market conditions we estimate and record a loss reserve for mortgage loans held in portfolio and mortgage loans held for sale as well as known and projected mortgage loan repurchase requests a 20 or 40 increase in the amount of expected mortgage loan repurchases and expected losses on mortgage loan repurchases would result in an increase of approximately 14 million  or 30 million  respectively in our reserve for expected mortgage loan repurchases 

inventories and cost of sales  — inventory includes the costs of direct land acquisition land development and home construction capitalized interest real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and home construction costs that we incur after development projects or homes are substantially complete such as utilities maintenance and cleaning are charged to sga expense as incurred all indirect overhead costs such as compensation of sales personnel division and region management and the costs of advertising and builder’s risk insurance are charged to sga expense as incurred 

land and development costs are typically allocated to individual residential lots on a prorata basis and the costs of residential lots are transferred to construction in progress when home construction begins we use the specific identification method for the purpose of accumulating home construction costs cost of sales for homes closed includes the specific construction costs of each home and all applicable land acquisition land development and related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred allocated to each residential lot based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each 

community any changes to the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial home closings in a community are generally allocated on a prorata basis to the remaining homes in the community associated with the relevant development activity 

when a home is closed we generally have not paid all incurred costs necessary to complete the home we record as a liability and as a charge to cost of sales the amount we estimate will ultimately be paid related to completed homes that have been closed we compare our home construction budgets to actual recorded costs to determine the additional costs remaining to be paid on each closed home we monitor the accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on closed homes in subsequent months to the amounts previously accrued although actual costs to be paid in the future on previously closed homes could differ from our current accruals such differences have not been significant 

each quarter the performance and outlook of land inventory and communities are reviewed for indicators of potential impairment we generally review our inventory for impairment indicators at the community level and the inventory within each community is categorized as land held for development residential land and lots developed and under development and construction in progress and finished homes based on the stage of production or plans for future development a particular community often includes inventory in more than one category in certain situations inventory may be analyzed separately for impairment purposes based on its product type eg single family homes evaluated separately from condominium parcels in reviewing each of our communities we determine if impairment indicators exist on inventory held and used by analyzing a variety of factors including but not limited to the following 

 

if indicators of impairment are present for a community we perform an impairment evaluation of the community which includes an analysis to determine if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts and if so impairment charges are recorded to cost of sales if the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying amounts these estimates of cash flows are significantly impacted by community specific factors including estimates of the amounts and timing of future revenues and estimates of the amount of land development materials and labor costs which in turn may be impacted by the following local market conditions 

 

for those assets deemed to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets our determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams when an impairment charge for a community is determined the charge is then allocated to each lot in the community in the same manner as land and development costs are allocated to each lot impairment charges are also recorded on finished 

homes in substantially completed communities when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values are greater than the fair values less estimated costs to sell these homes 

for the inventory impairment analyses we performed during fiscal 2013  we assumed that for the majority of communities sales prices in future periods will be equal to or lower than current sales order prices in each community or in comparable communities in order to generate an acceptable absorption rate for a minority of communities that we do not intend to develop or operate in current market conditions some increases over current sales prices were assumed the remaining lives of the communities evaluated were estimated to be in a range from six months to in excess of ten years and we utilized a range of discount rates for communities from 12  to 18  

we rarely purchase land for resale however when we own land or communities under development that do not fit into our development and construction plans and we determine to sell the asset the project is accounted for as land held for sale we record land held for sale at the lesser of its carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell in performing the impairment evaluation for land held for sale we consider several factors including but not limited to recent offers received to purchase the property prices for land in recent comparable sales transactions and market analysis studies which include the estimated price a willing buyer would pay for the land if the estimated fair value less costs to sell an asset is less than the current carrying value the asset is written down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell 

the key assumptions relating to inventory valuations are impacted by local market economic conditions and the actions of competitors and are inherently uncertain due to uncertainties in the estimation process actual results could differ from such estimates our quarterly assessments reflect management’s estimates and we continue to monitor the fair value of heldforsale assets through the disposition date 

fair value measurements  — the fasb’s authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes a threelevel hierarchy based upon the inputs to the valuation model of an asset or liability the fair value hierarchy and its application to our assets and liabilities is as follows 

 

when available we use quoted market prices in active markets to determine fair value we consider the principal market and nonperformance risk associated with our counterparties when determining the fair value measurements if applicable fair value measurements are used for our marketable securities mortgage loans held for sale debt securities collateralized by residential real estate interest rate lock commitments irlcs and other derivative instruments on a recurring basis and are used for inventories other mortgage loans and real estate owned on a nonrecurring basis when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

goodwill   we record goodwill associated with our acquisitions of businesses when the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired we evaluate our goodwill balances for potential impairment on an annual basis the current guidance allows an entity to assess qualitatively whether it is necessary to perform step one of a prescribed twostep annual goodwill impairment test if an entity believes as a result of its qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount the twostep goodwill impairment test is not required we performed a qualitative assessment of our goodwill balance of 389 million at september 30 2013 and 2012 and determined that the twostep process was not necessary 

warranty claims  — we typically provide our homebuyers with a tenyear limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems a twoyear limited warranty on major mechanical systems and a oneyear limited warranty on other construction components since we subcontract our construction work to subcontractors who typically provide an indemnity and a certificate of insurance prior to receiving payments for their work claims relating to workmanship and materials are generally the primary responsibility of the subcontractors warranty liabilities have been established by charging cost of sales for each home delivered the amounts charged are based on management’s estimate of expected warrantyrelated costs under all unexpired warranty obligation periods our warranty liability is based upon historical warranty cost experience in each market in which we operate and is adjusted as appropriate to reflect qualitative risks associated with the types of homes we build and the geographic areas in which we build them actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts a 10 change in the historical warranty rates used to estimate our warranty accrual would not result in a material change in our accrual 

legal claims and insurance  — we are named as a defendant in various claims complaints and other legal actions in the ordinary course of business at any point in time we are managing several hundred individual claims related to construction defect matters personal injury claims employment matters land development issues and contract disputes we have established reserves for these contingencies based on the estimated costs of pending claims and the estimated costs of anticipated future claims related to previously closed homes at both september 30 2013  and 2012  99  of these reserves related to construction defect matters 

our reserves for construction defect claims include the estimated costs of both known claims and anticipated future claims as of september 30 2013  and 2012  we had reserves for approximately 160  and 170  pending construction defect claims respectively and no individual existing claim was material to our financial statements during fiscal 2013  we established reserves for approximately 80  new construction defect claims and resolved 90  construction defect claims for a total cost of 444 million  the majority of our total construction defect reserves consists of the estimated exposure to future claims on previously closed homes we have closed a significant number of homes during recent years and as a result we may be subject to future construction defect claims on these homes although regulations vary from state to state construction defect issues can generally be reported for up to ten years after the home has closed in many states in which we operate historical data and trends regarding the frequency of claims incurred and the costs to resolve claims relative to the types of products and markets where we operate are used to estimate the construction defect liabilities for both existing and anticipated future claims these estimates are subject to ongoing revision as the circumstances of individual pending claims and historical data and trends change adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the accounting period in which the change in estimate occurs 

historical trends in construction defect claims have been inconsistent and we believe they may continue to fluctuate over the next several years housing market conditions have been volatile across most of our markets over the past ten years and we believe such conditions can affect the frequency and cost of construction defect claims we closed a significant number of homes during our peak operating years from 2003 to 2007 if the ultimate resolution of construction defect claims resulting from closings in those years varies from current expectations it could significantly change our estimates regarding the frequency and timing of claims incurred and the costs to resolve existing and anticipated future claims which would impact the construction defect reserves in the future if the frequency of claims incurred or costs of existing and future legal claims significantly exceed our current estimates they will have a significant negative impact on our future earnings and liquidity 

we estimate and record receivables under applicable insurance policies related to our estimated contingencies for known claims and anticipated future construction defect claims on previously closed homes and other legal claims and lawsuits incurred in the ordinary course of business when recovery is probable additionally we may have the ability to recover a portion of our losses from our subcontractors and their insurance carriers when we have been named as an additional insured on their insurance policies 

the estimation of losses related to these reserves and the related estimates of recoveries from insurance policies are subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends in construction defect claims relative to our markets and the types of products built claim frequency claim settlement costs and patterns insurance industry practices and legal interpretations among others due to the high degree of judgment required in establishing reserves for these contingencies actual future costs and recoveries from insurance could differ significantly from current estimated amounts a 10 increase in the claim frequency and the average cost per claim used to estimate the reserves would result in an increase of approximately 939 million  in our reserves and a 500 million  increase in our receivable resulting in additional expense of 439 million  a 

10 decrease in the claim frequency and the average cost per claim would result in a decrease of approximately 843 million  in our reserves and a 439 million  decrease in our receivable resulting in a reduction in expense of 404 million  

income taxes  — we calculate our income tax expense benefit using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and of tax loss and credit carryforwards in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income in future periods and in the jurisdictions in which those temporary differences become deductible we record a valuation allowance when we determine it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized in determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns judgment is required differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position changes in existing tax laws and tax rates also affect actual tax results and the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 

interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in the financial statements as a component of income tax expense significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions we evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis our evaluations are based upon a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change 

stockbased compensation  — our common stockholders formally authorize shares of stockbased compensation available for future grants from time to time the compensation committee of our board of directors authorizes the grant of stockbased compensation to our employees and directors from these available shares at september 30 2013  our outstanding stockbased compensation awards include stock options and restricted stock units grants of restricted stock units may vest immediately or over a certain number of years as determined by the compensation committee of our board of directors restricted stock units outstanding at september 30 2013  vest over a period of 1  to 3 years  stock options are granted at exercise prices which equal the market value of our common stock at the date of the grant the stock options outstanding at september 30 2013  vest over periods of 2  to 975 years and expire 10 years  after the dates on which they were granted 

the compensation expense for stockbased awards is based on the fair value of the award and is recognized on a straightline basis over the remaining vesting period the fair values of restricted stock units are based on the stock prices at the date of grant the fair values of stock options granted are calculated on the date of grant using a blackscholes option pricing model determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions which involve a number of variables these variables include but are not limited to the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards the expected dividend yield and expected stock option exercise behavior in addition we also use judgment in estimating the number of sharebased awards that are expected to be forfeited the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense are reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows as a financing cash flow 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in december 2011 the fasb issued asu 201111 “disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities” which requires entities to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements of financial instruments and derivative instruments in january 2013 this guidance was amended by asu 201301 clarifying the scope of disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities which limits the scope of asu 201111 to certain derivatives repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending transactions the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2013 and is to be applied retrospectively the adoption of this guidance which is related to disclosure only is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend 

we are subject to interest rate risk on our longterm debt we monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and utilize both fixed and variable rate debt for fixed rate debt changes in interest rates generally affect the value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows conversely for variable rate debt changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument but may affect our future earnings and cash flows except in very limited circumstances we do not have an obligation to prepay fixedrate debt prior to maturity and as a result interest rate risk and changes in fair value would not have a significant impact on our cash flows related to our fixedrate debt until such time as we are required to refinance repurchase or repay such debt 

we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with our mortgage loan origination services we manage interest rate risk through the use of forward sales of mortgagebacked securities mbs which are referred to as “hedging instruments” in the following discussion we do not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate lock commitments irlcs are extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and who meet defined credit and underwriting criteria typically the irlcs have a duration of less than six months some irlcs are committed immediately to a specific purchaser through the use of bestefforts whole loan delivery commitments while other irlcs are funded prior to being committed to thirdparty purchasers the hedging instruments related to irlcs are classified and accounted for as derivative instruments in an economic hedge with gains and losses recognized in financial services revenues on the consolidated statements of operations hedging instruments related to funded uncommitted loans are accounted for at fair value with changes recognized in financial services revenues on the consolidated statements of operations along with changes in the fair value of the funded uncommitted loans the fair value change related to the hedging instruments generally offsets the fair value change in the uncommitted loans the net fair value change which for the years ended september 30 2013  and 2012  was not significant is recognized in current earnings at september 30 2013  hedging instruments used to mitigate interest rate risk related to uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale and uncommitted irlcs totaled a notional amount of 4740 million  uncommitted irlcs totaled a notional amount of approximately 3341 million  and uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale totaled a notional amount of approximately 1736 million  at september 30 2013  

the following table sets forth principal cash flows by scheduled maturity effective weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value of our debt obligations as of september 30 2013  the interest rate for our variable rate debt represents the weighted average interest rate of our mortgage repurchase facility at september 30 2013  because the mortgage repurchase facility is effectively secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale which are typically sold within 60 days its outstanding balance is included as a variable rate maturity in the most current period presented

donald r horton began our homebuilding business in 1978 in 1991 we were incorporated in delaware to acquire the assets and businesses of our predecessor companies which were residential home construction and development companies owned or controlled by mr horton in 1992 we completed our initial public offering of our common stock our company’s growth over the years was achieved by investing available capital into our existing homebuilding markets and into startup operations in new markets additionally we acquired other homebuilding companies which strengthened our position in existing markets and expanded our geographic presence and product offerings in other markets our homes generally range in size from 1000  to 4000 square feet and in price from 100000  to 600000  for the year ended september 30 2012  we closed 18890  homes with an average sales price of approximately 223300  

through our financial services operations we provide mortgage financing and title agency services to homebuyers in many of our homebuilding markets dhi mortgage our 100 owned subsidiary provides mortgage financing services primarily to our homebuilding customers and generally sells the mortgages it originates and the related servicing rights to thirdparty purchasers dhi mortgage originates loans in accordance with purchaser guidelines and historically has sold most of its mortgage production within 30 days of origination our subsidiary title companies serve as title insurance agents by providing title insurance policies examination and closing services primarily to our homebuilding customers 

our financial reporting segments consist of six homebuilding segments and a financial services segment our homebuilding operations are the most substantial part of our business comprising approximately 97  of consolidated revenues which totaled 44 billion  in fiscal 2012  our homebuilding operations generate most of their revenues from the sale of completed homes with a lesser amount from the sale of land and lots in addition to building traditional singlefamily detached homes we also build attached homes such as town homes duplexes triplexes and condominiums the sale of detached homes generated approximately 90  of home sales revenues in fiscal 2012  our financial services segment generates its revenues from originating and selling mortgages and collecting fees for title insurance agency and closing services

operating strategy and structure 

for a substantial part of our companys existence we achieved significant growth and profitability through an operating strategy focused on capturing greater market share while maintaining a strong balance sheet to execute our strategy we invested available capital in our existing homebuilding markets opportunistically entered new markets and acquired other homebuilding companies 

during the industry downturn over the last several years we managed our business to generate a significant amount of cash from operations we used this cash to reduce our outstanding debt and increase our cash balances which provided us with a strong liquidity position lower balance sheet leverage and improved operational flexibility we also implemented restrictive land and lot inventory investment guidelines and did not increase our inventory levels from 2007 through 2011 

although new home demand remains at low historical levels in fiscal 2012 we saw an improvement in demand that has positively impacted our profitability and our confidence in the new home market we have begun increasing our capital investments in land lot and home inventories to expand our operations while controlling our construction costs and selling and overhead expenses to increase our profitability we expect however that the recent improvement in conditions will continue to be uneven across our markets in the near term our strong balance sheet and liquidity provide us flexibility to execute the appropriate operating strategy in each of our markets based on the relative strength or weakness of housing conditions in each market 

geographic diversity 

our homebuilding business began in the dallasfort worth area which is still one of our largest local homebuilding operations and home to our corporate headquarters we significantly expanded our business across the united states by entering additional markets through startup operations and acquisitions and we currently operate in 26 states and 77  markets this provides us with geographic diversification in our homebuilding inventory investments and our sources of revenues and earnings we believe our diversification strategy helps to mitigate the effects of local and regional economic cycles and enhances our longterm potential 

economies of scale 

we are the largest homebuilding company in the united states in terms of number of homes closed in fiscal 2012  by the same measure we are also one of the five largest builders in many of our markets in fiscal 2012  we believe that our national regional and local scale of operations provides us with benefits that may not be available in the same degree to some other smaller homebuilders such as 

 

decentralized operations 

we decentralize our homebuilding activities to give operating flexibility to our local division presidents on certain key operating decisions at september 30 2012  we had 32  separate homebuilding operating divisions many of which operate in more than one market area generally each operating division consists of a division president land entitlement acquisition and development personnel a sales manager and sales personnel a construction manager and construction superintendents customer service personnel a controller a purchasing manager and office staff we believe that division presidents and their management teams who are familiar with local conditions generally have better information on which to base many decisions regarding their operations our division presidents receive performance bonuses based upon achieving targeted financial and operating metrics related to their operating divisions 

operating division responsibilities 

each operating division is responsible for 

 — a feasibility study 

— soil and environmental reviews 

— review of existing zoning and other governmental requirements and 

— review of the need for and extent of offsite work required to meet local building codes 

 

centralized controls 

we centralize the key risk elements of our homebuilding business through our regional and corporate offices we have four separate homebuilding regional offices generally each regional office consists of a region president legal counsel a chief financial officer and limited office support staff each of our region presidents and their management teams are responsible for oversight of the operations of certain homebuilding operating divisions including 

 

our corporate executives and corporate office departments are responsible for establishing our operational policies and internal control standards and for monitoring compliance with established policies and controls throughout our operations the corporate office also has primary responsibility for direct management of certain key risk elements and initiatives through the following centralized functions 

 

cost management 

we control overhead costs by centralizing certain administrative and accounting functions and by monitoring staffing and compensation levels of administrative and management personnel we review other general and administrative costs to identify efficiencies and savings opportunities in our operating divisions and our regional and corporate offices we also direct many of our promotional activities toward local real estate brokers which we believe is an efficient use of our advertising expenditures 

we control construction costs by striving to design our homes efficiently and by obtaining competitive bids for construction materials and labor we also seek to negotiate favorable pricing from our primary subcontractors and suppliers based on the volume of services and products we purchase from them on a local regional and national basis we compare our land development expenditures to budgeted amounts and monitor our construction costs on each house we review our overall inventory levels margins expenses and profitability through our management information systems 

acquisitions 

we routinely evaluate opportunities to profitably expand our operations including potential acquisitions of other homebuilding or related businesses in fiscal 2012 we acquired the homebuilding operations of a company that operates in our southeast region acquisitions of homebuilding businesses can provide us with immediate land and home inventories as well as control of additional land and lot positions through option contracts in addition employees may have specialized knowledge of local market conditions including existing relationships with municipalities land owners developers subcontractors and suppliers these inventory positions and local market knowledge and relationships could take us several years to develop through our own startup efforts we seek to limit the risks associated with acquiring other companies by conducting extensive operational financial and legal due diligence on each acquisition and by performing financial analysis to determine that each acquisition will have a positive impact on our earnings within an acceptable period of time 

markets 

we conduct our homebuilding operations in the geographic regions states and markets listed below and we conduct our mortgage and title operations in many of these markets our homebuilding operating divisions are aggregated into six reporting segments also referred to as reporting regions which comprise the markets below our financial statements contain additional information regarding segment performance 



when evaluating new or existing homebuilding markets for purposes of capital allocation we consider local marketspecific factors including among others 

 

land policies 

we acquire land after we have completed due diligence and generally after we have obtained the rights known as entitlements to begin development or construction work resulting in an acceptable number of residential lots before we acquire lots or tracts of land we will among other things complete a feasibility study which includes soil tests independent environmental studies and other engineering work we also evaluate the status of necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements required to develop and use the property for home construction although we purchase and develop land primarily to support our homebuilding activities we may sell land and lots to other developers and homebuilders where we have excess land and lot positions 

we also enter into landlot option contracts in which we obtain the right but generally not the obligation to buy land or lots at predetermined prices on a defined schedule commensurate with anticipated home closings or planned development our option contracts generally are nonrecourse which limits our financial exposure to our earnest money deposited with land and lot sellers and any preacquisition due diligence costs we incurred this enables us to control land and lot positions with limited capital investment which substantially reduces the risks associated with land ownership and development 

almost all of our land and lot positions are acquired directly by us we are a party to a small number of joint ventures all of which are consolidated in our financial statements 

we attempt to mitigate our exposure to real estate inventory risks by

construction 

our home designs are selected or prepared in each of our markets to appeal to the tastes and preferences of local homebuyers in each community we also offer optional interior and exterior features to allow homebuyers to enhance the basic home design and to allow us to generate additional revenues from each home sold we continually adjust our product offerings to address our customers’ expectations for affordability home size and features 

substantially all of our construction work is performed by subcontractors subcontractors typically are selected after a competitive bidding process and retained for a specific subdivision or series of house plans pursuant to a contract that obligates the subcontractor to complete construction at an agreedupon price agreements with the subcontractors and suppliers we use generally are negotiated for each subdivision or series of house plans we employ construction superintendents to monitor homes under construction participate in major design and building decisions coordinate the activities of subcontractors and suppliers review the work of subcontractors for quality and cost controls and monitor compliance with zoning and building codes in addition our construction superintendents play a significant role in working with our homebuyers by assisting with option selection and home modification decisions educating buyers on the construction process and instructing buyers on postclosing home maintenance 

construction time for our homes depends on the weather availability of labor materials and supplies size of the home and other factors we typically complete the construction of a home within three to six months 

we typically do not maintain significant inventories of construction materials except for work in progress materials for homes under construction generally the construction materials used in our operations are readily available from numerous sources we have contracts exceeding one year with certain suppliers of our building materials that are cancelable at our option with 30 days notice as housing demand and activity began to increase in fiscal 2012 we experienced minor shortages and delays of materials and labor in some of our operating markets which we expect to be temporary and which have not had a material effect on our consolidated operating results 

marketing and sales 

we market and sell our homes through commissioned employees and independent real estate brokers we typically conduct home sales from sales offices located in furnished model homes in each subdivision and we typically do not offer our model homes for sale until the completion of a subdivision our sales personnel assist prospective homebuyers by providing them with floor plans price information tours of model homes and assisting them with the selection of options and other custom features we train and inform our sales personnel as to the availability of financing construction schedules and marketing and advertising plans as our customers are typically firsttime or moveup homebuyers we attempt to adjust our product mix and pricing within our homebuilding markets to keep our homes affordable as market conditions warrant we may provide potential homebuyers with one or more of a variety of incentives including discounts and free upgrades to be competitive in a particular market 

we market our homes and communities to prospective homebuyers and real estate brokers in our local markets through electronic media including email social networking sites and our company internet website as well as brochures flyers newsletters and promotional events we also use billboards radio television and newspaper advertising as necessary in each local market we attempt to position our subdivisions in locations that are desirable to potential homebuyers and convenient to or visible from local traffic patterns which helps to minimize advertising costs we believe that model homes play a substantial role in our marketing efforts and therefore expend significant effort to create an attractive atmosphere in our model homes 

we also build speculative homes in most of our subdivisions these homes enhance our marketing and sales efforts to prospective homebuyers who are relocating to these markets as well as to independent brokers who often represent homebuyers requiring a completed home within a short time frame we determine our speculative homes strategy in each market based on local market factors such as new job growth the number of job relocations housing demand and supply seasonality current sales contract cancellation trends and our past experience in the market we maintain a level of speculative home inventory in each subdivision based on our current and planned sales pace and we monitor and adjust speculative home inventory on an ongoing basis as conditions warrant speculative homes help to provide us with opportunities to sell additional homes at a profit and generate positive returns and cash flows on our inventory of owned lots 

our sales contracts require an earnest money deposit which varies in amount among our markets and subdivisions additionally customers are generally required to pay additional deposits when they select options or upgrade features for their homes most of our sales contracts stipulate that when customers cancel their contracts with us we have the right to retain their earnest money and option deposits however our operating divisions often choose to refund the deposit our sales contracts also include a financing contingency which permits customers to cancel and receive a refund of their deposit if they cannot obtain mortgage financing at prevailing or specified interest rates within a specified period our contracts may include other contingencies such as the sale of an existing home as a percentage of gross sales orders cancellations of sales contracts in fiscal 2012  were 24  compared to 27  in fiscal 2011  the length of time between the signing of a sales contract for a home and delivery of the home to the buyer closing is generally from two to six months 

customer service and quality control 

our operating divisions are responsible for preclosing quality control inspections and responding to customers’ postclosing needs we believe that a prompt and courteous response to homebuyers’ needs during and after construction reduces postclosing repair costs enhances our reputation for quality and service and ultimately leads to repeat and referral business from the real estate community and homebuyers we typically provide our homebuyers with a tenyear limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems a twoyear limited warranty on major mechanical systems and a oneyear limited warranty on other construction components the subcontractors who perform the actual construction also provide us with warranties on workmanship and are generally prepared to respond to us and the homeowner promptly upon request in addition some of our suppliers provide manufacturer’s warranties on specified products installed in the home 

sales order backlog 

at september 30 2012  the value of our backlog of sales orders was 16679 million   7240  homes an increase of 61  from 10362 million   4854  homes at september 30 2011  the average sales price of homes in backlog was 230400  at september 30 2012  up 8  from the 213500  average at september 30 2011  sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies including mortgage loan approval and buyers selling their existing homes which can result in cancellations a portion of the contracts in backlog will not result in closings due to cancellations substantially all of the homes in our sales backlog at september 30 2012  are scheduled to close in fiscal year 2013  further discussion of our backlog is provided in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

customer mortgage financing 

we provide mortgage financing services principally to purchasers of our homes in the majority of our homebuilding markets through our 100 owned subsidiary dhi mortgage dhi mortgage assists in the sales transaction by coordinating the mortgage application mortgage commitment and home closing processes to facilitate a timely and efficient homebuying experience for our buyers dhi mortgage originates mortgage loans for a substantial portion of our homebuyers during the year ended september 30 2012  dhi mortgage provided mortgage financing services for approximately 59  of our total homes closed and approximately 84  of dhi mortgage’s loan volume related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations 

to limit the risks associated with our mortgage operations dhi mortgage originates loan products that we believe can be sold to thirdparty purchasers dhi mortgage generally sells the loans and their servicing rights to thirdparty purchasers shortly after origination with limited recourse provisions in markets where we currently do not provide mortgage financing we work with a variety of mortgage lenders that make available to homebuyers a range of mortgage financing programs 

title services 

through our subsidiary title companies we serve as a title insurance agent in selected markets by providing title insurance policies examination and closing services primarily to the purchasers of homes we build and sell we currently assume little or no underwriting risk associated with these title policies 

employees 

at september 30 2012  we employed 3477 persons of whom 923  were sales and marketing personnel 1081  were executive administrative and clerical personnel 736  were involved in construction and 737  worked in mortgage and title operations we believe that our relations with our employees are good 

competition 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous other national regional and local homebuilders for homebuyers desirable properties raw materials skilled labor employees management talent and financing we also compete with resales of existing homes foreclosed homes and with the rental housing market our homes compete on the basis of quality price design mortgage financing terms and location our financial services business competes with other mortgage lenders including national regional and local mortgage bankers and other financial institutions some of which are subject to fewer government regulations or have greater access to capital different lending criteria and broader product offerings 

governmental regulation and environmental matters 

the homebuilding industry is subject to extensive and complex regulations we and the subcontractors we use must comply with many federal state and local laws and regulations including zoning density and development requirements building environmental advertising labor and real estate sales rules and regulations these regulations and requirements affect the development process as well as building materials to be used building designs and minimum elevation of properties our homes are inspected by local authorities where required and homes eligible for insurance or guarantees provided by the federal housing administration fha and the department of veteran affairs va are subject to inspection by them these regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities in addition our new housing developments may be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets utilities and other public improvements 

our homebuilding operations are also subject to an extensive variety of local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning protection of health safety and the environment the particular environmental laws for each site vary greatly according to location environmental condition and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties 

our mortgage company and title insurance agencies must comply with extensive federal and state laws and regulations as administered by numerous federal and state government agencies these include eligibility and other requirements for participation in the programs offered by the fha va government national mortgage association ginnie mae federal national mortgage association fannie mae federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac and the united states department of agriculture usda these laws and regulations also require compliance with consumer lending laws and other regulations governing disclosure requirements prohibitions against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures these laws and regulations subject our operations to examination by the applicable agencies 

seasonality 

prior to the recent downturn in the homebuilding industry which began to affect our seasonal patterns in fiscal 2007 we experienced relatively predictable seasonal variations in our quarterly operating results and capital requirements we began to experience our normal seasonal pattern again in both fiscal 2011 and 2012 we generally have more homes under construction close more homes and have greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year the seasonal activity increases our working capital requirements for our homebuilding operations during the third and fourth fiscal quarters and increases our funding requirements for the mortgages we originate in our financial services segment at the end of these quarters as a result of seasonal activity our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend 

discussion of our business and operations included in this annual report on form 10k should be read together with the risk factors set forth below they describe various risks and uncertainties we are or may become subject to many of which are difficult to predict or beyond our control these risks and uncertainties together with other factors described elsewhere in this report have the potential to affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner 

the homebuilding industry experienced a significant downturn in recent years although industry conditions improved during fiscal 2012 the general us economy remains weak a subsequent deterioration in industry conditions could adversely affect our business or financial results 

we experienced one of the most severe housing downturns in us history from 2006 through 2011 during this downturn we experienced significant reductions in our home sales and homebuilding revenues and we incurred substantial asset impairments and writeoffs our recent results and other national data indicate that the overall demand for new homes improved during fiscal 2012 however both national new home sales and our companys home sales remain below historical levels due to the current weak us economic conditions the restrictive mortgage lending environment and variations in local housing market conditions the us economy could be negatively impacted in the shortterm by potential changes in fiscal tax and monetary policies currently under consideration by the federal government therefore it remains uncertain whether homebuilding industry conditions will continue to improve remain stable or deteriorate from current levels a subsequent deterioration in industry conditions could adversely affect our business or financial results 

the homebuilding industry is cyclical and affected by changes in economic real estate or other conditions that could adversely affect our business or financial results 

the homebuilding industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic and real estate conditions such as 

 

adverse changes in these general and local economic conditions or deterioration in the broader economy could have a negative impact on our business or financial results also changes in these economic conditions may affect some of our regions or markets more than others if adverse conditions affect any of our larger markets they could have a proportionately greater impact on us than on some other homebuilding companies 

weather conditions and natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes wildfires volcanic activity droughts and floods can harm our homebuilding business these can delay home closings adversely affect the cost or availability of materials or labor or damage homes under construction the climates and geology of many of the states in which we operate including california florida texas and other coastal areas where we have some of our larger operations present increased risks of adverse weather or natural disasters 

deployments of us military personnel to foreign regions terrorist attacks other acts of violence or threats to national security and any corresponding response by the united states or others or related domestic or international instability may adversely affect general economic conditions or cause a slowdown of the economy 

as a result of the foregoing matters potential customers may be less willing or able to buy our homes in the future our pricing and product strategies may also be limited by market conditions we may be unable to change the mix of our home offerings reduce the costs of the homes we build offer more affordable homes or satisfactorily address changing market conditions in other ways without adversely affecting our profit margins in addition cancellations of home sales contracts in backlog may increase if homebuyers choose to not honor their contracts due to any of the factors discussed above 

our financial services business is closely related to our homebuilding business as it originates mortgage loans principally to purchasers of the homes we build a decrease in the demand for our homes because of the foregoing matters will also adversely affect the financial results of this segment of our business an increase in the default rate on the mortgages we originate may adversely affect our ability to sell the mortgages or the pricing we receive upon the sale of mortgages or may increase our recourse obligations for previous originations we establish reserves related to mortgages we have sold however actual future obligations related to these mortgages could differ significantly from our currently estimated amounts 

constriction of the credit markets could limit our ability to access capital and increase our costs of capital 

during the recent industry downturn we generated substantial operating cash flow and we relied principally on our cash on hand to meet our working capital needs and repay outstanding indebtedness during much of the downturn the credit markets constricted and reduced some sources of liquidity that were previously available to us there likely will be other periods in the future when financial market upheaval will limit our ability to access the public debt markets or obtain bank financing or doing so will increase our cost of capital 

we recently obtained a revolving credit facility which provides committed loan financing for five  years in an amount currently totaling 600 million  also our mortgage subsidiary dhi mortgage uses a mortgage repurchase facility to finance many of the loans it originates the mortgage repurchase facility must be renewed annually and it currently expires in march 2013 adverse changes in market conditions could make the renewal of these facilities more difficult or could result in an increase in the cost of these facilities or a decrease in their committed availability such changes affecting our mortgage repurchase facility may also make it more difficult or costly to sell the mortgages that we originate 

we believe that our existing cash resources our revolving credit facility and our mortgage repurchase facility provide sufficient liquidity to fund our nearterm working capital needs and debt obligations we regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund future growth in our business repay our longerterm debt obligations and support our other general corporate and operational needs and we regularly evaluate our opportunities to raise additional capital as market conditions permit we may issue new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets or obtain additional bank financing to fund our projected capital requirements or provide additional liquidity adverse changes in economic homebuilding or capital market conditions could negatively impact our business liquidity and financial results 

reductions in the availability of mortgage financing and the liquidity provided by governmentsponsored enterprises the effects of government programs a decrease in our ability to sell mortgage loans on attractive terms or an increase in mortgage interest rates could adversely affect our business or financial results 

during the last six years the mortgage lending industry has experienced significant change and contraction credit requirements have tightened and investor demand for mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities has been predominantly limited to securities backed by fannie mae freddie mac or ginnie mae as a result it is difficult for some potential buyers to finance the purchase of our homes further tightening of credit requirements could adversely affect our business or financial results 

we believe that the liquidity provided by fannie mae freddie mac and ginnie mae to the mortgage industry has been very important to the housing market fannie mae and freddie mac have required substantial injections of capital from the federal government and may require additional government support in the future there has been ongoing discussion by the government with regard to the long term structure and viability of fannie mae and freddie mac these discussions include the downsizing of their portfolios as well as the tightening of guidelines for their loan products in addition increased lending volume and losses insured by the fha have resulted in a reduction of its insurance fund any reduction in the availability of the financing or insuring provided by these institutions could adversely affect interest rates mortgage availability and sales of new homes and mortgage loans the fha insures mortgage loans that generally have lower credit requirements and as a result continue to be a particularly important source for financing the sale of our homes in recent years more restrictive guidelines have been placed on fha insured loans affecting minimum down payment and availability for condominium financing 

additional future restrictions may negatively affect the availability or affordability of fha financing which could adversely affect our ability to sell homes 

while the use of down payment assistance programs by our homebuyers has decreased significantly some of our customers still utilize 100 financing through programs offered by the va and united states department of agriculture usda these governmentsponsored loan programs are subject to changes in regulations lending standards and government funding levels there can be no assurances that these programs or other programs will continue to be available in our homebuilding markets or that they will be as attractive to our customers as the programs currently offered which could negatively affect our sales 

the mortgage loans originated by our financial services operations are generally sold to thirdparty purchasers during fiscal 2012 the majority of our mortgage loans were sold to one major financial institution that provided the best pricing and execution relative to other available loan purchasers on an ongoing basis we seek to establish additional loan purchase arrangements with multiple institutions if we are unable to sell mortgage loans to additional purchasers on attractive terms our ability to originate and sell mortgage loans at competitive prices could be limited which would negatively affect our profitability 

even if potential customers do not need financing changes in the availability of mortgage products may make it more difficult for them to sell their current homes to potential buyers who need financing 

mortgage rates are currently at historically low levels if interest rates increase the costs of owning a home will be affected and could result in a decline in the demand for our homes 

the risks associated with our land and lot inventory could adversely affect our business or financial results 

inventory risks are substantial for our homebuilding business we have recently begun to increase our investments in land and lot inventories in response to increased demand for our homes there are risks inherent in controlling owning and developing land and if housing demand declines we may own land or lots at a cost we will not be able to recover fully or on which we cannot build and sell homes profitably also there can be significant fluctuations in the value of our owned undeveloped land building lots and housing inventories related to changes in market conditions as a result our deposits for building lots controlled under option or similar contracts may be put at risk we may have to sell homes or land for a lower profit margin or we may have to record inventory impairment charges on our developed and undeveloped land and lots a significant deterioration in economic or homebuilding industry conditions may result in substantial inventory impairment charges 

homebuilding is subject to home warranty and construction defect claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant 

we are subject to home warranty and construction defect claims arising in the ordinary course of our homebuilding business we rely on subcontractors to perform the actual construction of our homes and in many cases to select and obtain construction materials despite our detailed specifications and monitoring of the construction process our subcontractors occasionally use improper construction processes or defective materials in the construction of our homes when we find these issues we repair them in accordance with our warranty obligations we spend significant resources to repair items in homes we have sold to fulfill the warranties we issued to our homebuyers additionally we are subject to construction defect claims which can be costly to defend and resolve in the legal system warranty and construction defect matters can also result in negative publicity in the media and on the internet which can damage our reputation and adversely affect our ability to sell homes 

based on the large number of homes we have sold over the years our potential liabilities related to warranty and construction defect claims are significant as a consequence we maintain product liability insurance and we obtain indemnities and certificates of insurance from subcontractors covering claims related to their workmanship and materials we establish warranty and other reserves for the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built because of the uncertainties inherent to these matters we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will be adequate to address all of our future warranty and construction defect claims contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce we may be responsible for applicable selfinsured retentions and some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits additionally the coverage offered by and the availability of product liability insurance for 

construction defects is limited and costly we have responded to increases in insurance costs and coverage limitations by increasing our selfinsured retentions and claim reserves there can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted or become more costly 

supply shortages and other risks related to acquiring land building materials and skilled labor could increase our costs and 

delay deliveries 

the homebuilding industry has from time to time experienced significant difficulties that can affect the cost or timing of 

construction including 

 

these factors may cause us to take longer or incur more costs to build our homes and adversely affect our revenues and margins if the recent increases in home sales continue or accelerate in future periods the potential risk of shortages in residential lots labor and materials available to the homebuilding industry could increase in some markets where we operate 

we are required to obtain performance bonds the unavailability of which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

we often are required to provide surety bonds to secure our performance or obligations under construction contracts development agreements and other arrangements our ability to obtain surety bonds primarily depends upon our credit rating financial condition past performance and other factors including the capacity of the surety market and the underwriting practices of surety bond issuers the ability to obtain surety bonds also can be impacted by the willingness of insurance companies to issue performance bonds for construction and development activities if we are unable to obtain surety bonds when required our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted 

increases in the costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business or financial results 

significant expenses of owning a home including mortgage interest and real estate taxes generally are deductible expenses for an individual’s federal and in some cases state income taxes subject to various limitations under current tax law and policy if the federal government or a state government changes its income tax laws as has been discussed from time to time to eliminate or substantially modify these income tax deductions the aftertax cost of owning a new home would increase for many of our potential customers the loss or reduction of homeowner tax deductions if such tax law changes were enacted without offsetting provisions could adversely impact demand for and sales prices of new homes 

in addition increases in property tax rates by local governmental authorities as experienced in some areas in response to reduced federal and state funding could adversely affect the ability of potential customers to obtain financing or their desire to purchase new homes 

governmental regulations and environmental matters could increase the cost and limit the availability of our development and homebuilding projects and adversely affect our business or financial results 

we are subject to extensive and complex regulations that affect land development and home construction including zoning density restrictions building design and building standards these regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities as to the conditions we must meet prior to development or construction being approved if approved at all we are subject to determinations by these authorities as to the adequacy of water or sewage facilities roads or other local services new housing developments may also be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets and other public improvements in addition in many markets government authorities have implemented no growth or growth control 

initiatives any of these can limit delay or increase the costs of development or home construction 

we are also subject to a significant number and variety of local state and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of health safety labor standards and the environment the impact of environmental laws varies depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available these matters may result in delays may cause us to incur substantial compliance remediation mitigation and other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas government agencies also routinely initiate audits reviews or investigations of our business practices to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations which can cause us to incur costs or create other disruptions in our business that can be significant 

the subcontractors we rely on to perform the actual construction of our homes are also subject to a significant number of local state and federal laws and regulations including laws involving matters that are not within our control if our subcontractors fail to comply with all applicable laws we can suffer reputational damage and may be exposed to possible liability 

we are also subject to an extensive number of laws and regulations because our common stock and debt securities are publicly traded in the capital markets these regulations govern our communications with our shareholders and the capital markets our financial statement disclosures and our legal processes and they also impact the work required to be performed by our independent registered public accounting firm and our legal counsel changes in these laws and regulations including the subsequent implementation of rules by the administering government authorities can require us to incur additional compliance costs and such costs can be significant 

in august 2012 the sec adopted a final rule on conflict minerals as mandated by the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act which was signed into law in july 2010 the rule requires an entity to file a new form to publicly disclose its use of conflict minerals defined as tantalum tin tungsten and gold if these minerals are necessary to the functionality or production of products it manufactures additional reporting is required if it is determined that the conflict minerals were mined from the democratic republic of the congo drc or adjoining countries this new rule will require us to perform due diligence to determine whether our suppliers use any of these materials in their production processes and the sources of such materials which will increase our administrative costs these new requirements could also adversely affect the sourcing supply and costs of materials used in the construction of our homes 

governmental regulation of our financial services operations could adversely affect our business or financial results 

our financial services operations are subject to a significant number of federal state and local laws and regulations these include eligibility requirements for participation in federal loan programs compliance with consumer lending laws and other regulations governing disclosure requirements prohibitions against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures our financial services operations are subject to examination by federal state and local government agencies these laws regulations and examinations may limit our ability to provide mortgage financing or title services to potential purchasers of our homes 

 the doddfrank act provides for a number of new requirements relating to residential mortgage lending practices many of which are to be developed further by rules enacted by the appropriate government agencies responsible for regulating the mortgage industry many of these rules have not yet been finalized or implemented these include among others minimum standards for mortgages and lender practices in making mortgages limitations on certain fees and incentive arrangements retention of credit risk and remedies for borrowers in foreclosure proceedings the effect of such provisions on our financial services business will depend on the rules that are ultimately enacted key decisions that have yet to be made concern the characteristics of mortgages that would be exempt from risk retention how risk retention requirements will be implemented and how derivative trading will be impacted these factors could restrict the availability of and increase the cost of mortgage credit in addition to increasing the general and administrative costs within our financial services operations 

the turmoil caused by the significant number of defaults and resulting foreclosures during the recent downturn has encouraged consumer lawsuits and the investigation of financial services industry practices by governmental authorities these investigations may include the examination of consumer lending practices real estate settlement procedures foreclosure and servicing policies or other practices in the financial services segments of homebuilding companies these governmental inquiries could result in changes in regulations or homebuilding industry practices and they could adversely affect the costs and potential profitability of homebuilding companies additionally if pending legislation is enacted as currently proposed 

regulations that favor financial services businesses that are not affiliated with homebuilding companies will place our financial services business at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace which would adversely affect its profitability 

our debt obligations and our ability to comply with related covenants restrictions or limitations could adversely affect our financial condition 

as of september 30 2012  our consolidated debt was 24931 million  we have 11475 million  principal amount of our debt maturing before the end of fiscal 2014 of which 500 million  is in the form of convertible senior notes that will mature on may 15 2014 and are convertible into approximately 383 million shares of our common stock at a price of 1306 per share at maturity the indentures governing our senior and convertible senior notes do not restrict the incurrence of future unsecured debt by us or our homebuilding subsidiaries or the incurrence of secured or unsecured debt by our financial services subsidiaries and the agreement governing our revolving credit facility allows us to incur a substantial amount of future unsecured debt such instruments also permit us and our homebuilding subsidiaries to incur significant amounts of additional secured debt 

possible consequences the amount and the maturities of our debt could have important consequences for example they could 

 

in addition the magnitude of our debt and the restrictions imposed by the instruments governing these obligations expose us to additional risks including 

dependence on future performance our ability to meet our debt service and other obligations and the financial covenants under our revolving credit facility will depend in part upon our future financial performance our future results are subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report our revenues and earnings vary with the level of general economic activity in the markets we serve our businesses are also affected by financial political business and other factors many of which are beyond our control the factors that affect our ability to generate cash can also affect our ability to raise additional funds for these purposes through the sale of debt or equity the refinancing of debt or the sale of assets changes in prevailing interest rates may affect our ability to meet our debt service obligations because borrowings under our revolving credit facility and mortgage repurchase facility bear interest at floating rates 

revolving credit facility our revolving credit facility contains financial covenants requiring the maintenance of a minimum level of tangible net worth a maximum allowable leverage ratio and a borrowing base restriction if our leverage ratio exceeds a certain level a failure to comply with these requirements could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under the revolving credit facility or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity any difficulty experienced in complying with these covenants could make renewal of the facility more difficult or costly 

mortgage repurchase facility and other restrictions the mortgage repurchase facility for our mortgage subsidiary requires the maintenance of a minimum level of tangible net worth a maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and a minimum level of liquidity by our mortgage subsidiary a failure to comply with these requirements could allow the lending bank to terminate the availability of funds to the mortgage subsidiary or cause its debt to become due and payable prior to maturity any difficulty experienced in complying with these covenants could make the renewal of the mortgage repurchase facility more difficult or costly 

in addition although our financial services business is conducted through subsidiaries that are not restricted by our indentures the ability of our mortgage subsidiary to provide funds to our homebuilding operations would be restricted in the event such distribution of funds would cause an event of default under the mortgage repurchase facility or if an event of default had occurred under this facility moreover our right to receive assets from the mortgage subsidiary upon its liquidation or recapitalization will be subject to the prior claims of its creditors any claims we may have to funds from this segment would be subordinate to subsidiary indebtedness to the extent of any security for such indebtedness and to any indebtedness otherwise recognized as senior to our claims 

changes in debt ratings our senior unsecured debt is currently rated at below investment grade any lowering of our debt ratings could make accessing the public capital markets or obtaining additional credit from banks more difficult andor more expensive 

change of control purchase options and change of control default if a change of control occurs as defined in the indentures governing 4555 million  principal amount of our senior notes as of september 30 2012  we would be required to offer to purchase such notes at 101  of their principal amount together with all accrued and unpaid interest if any in addition upon the occurrence of both a change of control and a ratings downgrade event each as defined in the indenture governing 700 million  principal amount of our senior notes as of september 30 2012  we will be required in certain circumstances to offer to repurchase such notes at 101  of their principal amount together with all accrued and unpaid interest if any if a fundamental change including a change of control occurs as defined in the indenture governing our convertible senior notes which constituted 500 million  principal amount as of september 30 2012  we would be required to offer to purchase such notes at par together with all accrued and unpaid interest if any moreover a change of control as defined in the revolving credit facility would constitute an event of default under the revolving credit facility which could result in the acceleration of any borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and the termination of the commitments thereunder if more than 50 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility were accelerated and such acceleration were not rescinded within 30 days an event of default would result under the indentures governing our senior notes entitling holders of at least 25 percent in principal amount of the relevant series of notes then outstanding by notice to us and the trustee to declare all such notes to be due and payable immediately if purchase offers were required under the indentures for such notes or the borrowings under our revolving credit facility or senior notes were accelerated we can give no assurance that we would have sufficient funds to pay the amounts that we would be required to purchase 

homebuilding and financial services are very competitive industries and competitive conditions could adversely affect our business or financial results 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive homebuilders compete not only for homebuyers but also for desirable properties financing raw materials and skilled labor we compete with local regional and national homebuilders often within larger subdivisions designed planned and developed by such homebuilders we also compete with existing home sales foreclosures and rental properties the competitive conditions in the homebuilding industry can negatively impact our sales volumes selling prices and incentive levels reduce our profit margins and cause impairments in the value of our inventory or other assets competition can also affect our ability to acquire suitable land raw materials and skilled labor at acceptable prices or terms or cause delays in the construction of our homes 

our financial services business competes with other mortgage lenders including national regional and local mortgage banks and other financial institutions some of which are subject to fewer government regulations mortgage lenders who are subject to fewer regulations or have greater access to capital or different lending criteria may be able to offer more attractive financing to potential customers 

our homebuilding and financial services businesses compete with other companies both from within and outside of these industries to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced employees managers and executives competition for the services of these individuals will likely increase as business conditions improve in the homebuilding and financial services industries or in the general economy if we are unable to attract and retain key employees managers or executives our business could be adversely impacted 

we cannot make any assurances that any future growth strategies will be successful or not expose us to additional risks 

although we have focused on increasing our market share through internal growth in recent years we acquired the homebuilding operations of a small company in fiscal 2012 and may make strategic acquisitions of other homebuilding companies or their assets in the future successful strategic acquisitions require the integration of operations and management although we believe that we have been successful in the past we can give no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify acquire and integrate strategic acquisitions in the future acquisitions can result in the dilution of existing stockholders if we issue our common stock as consideration or reduce our liquidity or increase our debt if we fund them with cash in addition acquisitions can expose us to valuation risks including the risk of writing off goodwill or impairing inventory and other assets related to such acquisitions the risk of goodwill and other asset impairments increases during a cyclical housing downturn when our profitability may decline as evidenced by the goodwill and other asset impairment charges we recognized during the recent downturn in addition we may not be able to successfully implement our operating or internal growth strategies within our existing markets 

our business and financial results could be adversely affected by significant inflation or deflation 

inflation can adversely affect us by increasing costs of land materials and labor in addition significant inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates which have a negative impact on housing demand in a highly inflationary environment depending on industry and other economic conditions we may be precluded from raising home prices enough to keep up with the rate of inflation which could reduce our profit margins moreover with inflation the costs of capital increase and the purchasing power of our cash resources can decline current or future efforts by the government to stimulate the economy may increase the risk of significant inflation and its adverse impact on our business or financial results 

alternatively a significant period of deflation could cause a decrease in overall spending and borrowing levels this could lead to a further deterioration in economic conditions including an increase in the rate of unemployment deflation could also cause the value of our inventories to decline or reduce the value of existing homes below the related mortgage loan balance which could potentially increase the supply of existing homes and have a negative impact on our results of operations 

our deferred income tax asset may not be fully realizable 

as of september 30 2012  we had a deferred income tax asset net of deferred tax liabilities of 7514 million  against which we provided a valuation allowance of 419 million  the realization of all or a portion of our deferred income tax asset is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the statutory carryforward periods and in the jurisdictions in which the related temporary differences become deductible we have provided the valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax asset because it is more likely than not that a portion of our state net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized due to the more limited carryforward periods that exist in certain states our ability to utilize our net operating losses to reduce future income tax obligations would be limited if we experienced an ownership change as defined by section 382 of the internal revenue code under the rules such an ownership change is generally any change in ownership of more than 50 of its stock within a rolling threeyear period as calculated in accordance with the rules the rules generally operate by focusing on changes in ownership among stockholders considered by the rules as owning directly or indirectly 5 or more of the stock of the company and any change in ownership arising from new issuances of stock by the company if we undergo an ownership change for purposes of section 382 as a result of future transactions involving our common stock both the amount of and our ability to use any of our net operating loss carryforwards or tax credit carryforwards at the time of ownership change would be subject to the limitations of section 382 in addition these limitations may affect the expiration date of any net operating loss carryforwards or tax credit carryforwards and we may not be able to use them before they expire this could adversely affect our financial position results of operations and cash flow we do not believe we have experienced such an ownership change as of september 30 2012  however the amount by which our ownership may change in the future is affected by purchases and sales of stock by 5 stockholders new issuances of stock by us and the potential conversion of our outstanding convertible senior notes and our decision as to whether to settle any such conversions completely or partially in stock the accounting for deferred income taxes is based upon estimates of future results differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position changes in tax laws also affect actual tax results and the valuation of deferred income tax assets over time specifically a decrease in income tax rates would result in a decrease in our deferred tax assets 

information technology failures and data security breaches could harm our business 

we use information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational and marketing activities and to maintain our business records these information technology systems are dependent upon global communications providers web browsers telephone systems and other aspects of the internet infrastructure that have experienced security breaches cyberattacks significant systems failures and electrical outages in the past a material network breach in the security of our information technology systems could include the theft of customer employee or company data in february 2012 we experienced a software security breach by unknown external sources in our internet loan prequalification system which could have resulted in some of our customers’ personal data being compromised we investigated the breach with the assistance of information technology security experts and we are working with local and federal law enforcement to aid in their investigation of the breach our investigations produced no evidence that any of our customers’ data was actually accessed or exported from our systems a security breach such as the one we recently experienced or a significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers adversely impact our sales and revenue and require us to incur significant expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve these kinds of issues the release of confidential information as a result of a security breach may also lead to litigation or other proceedings against us by affected individuals or business partners or by regulators and the outcome of such proceedings which could include penalties or fines could have a significant negative impact on our business we may also be required to incur significant costs to protect against damages caused by these information technology failures or security breaches in the future we routinely utilize information technology security experts to assist us in our evaluations of the effectiveness of the security of our information technology systems and we regularly enhance our security measures to protect our systems and data however we cannot provide assurances that a security breach cyberattack data theft or other significant systems failures will not occur in the future and such occurrences could have a material and adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position

results of operations — fiscal year 2012  overview 

in fiscal 2012  demand for new homes improved in most of our operating markets as evidenced by the number and value of our net sales orders increasing 21  and 29  compared to the prior year revenues from home sales increased 19  to 42 billion  in fiscal 2012  compared to 35 billion  in fiscal 2011  the average selling prices of our homes closed increased 5  and our gross margins on homes closed increased by 160  basis points in fiscal 2012  as compared to fiscal 2011  pretax income was 2429 million  in the current year compared to 121 million  in the prior year our sales order backlog of 17 billion  at september 30 2012  is up 61  from a year ago which positions us for a strong start in fiscal 2013 these results reflect our ability to operate profitably and grow in the current environment through our strategy of investing capital to expand and improve the profitability of our operations managing inventory levels efficiently and controlling sga and interest costs 

our recent results and other national data indicate that the overall demand for new homes has improved from the prior year however both national new home sales and our companys home sales remain below historical levels due to the current weak us economic conditions the restrictive mortgage lending environment and variations in local housing market conditions until there is a more robust us economic recovery we expect national demand for new homes to remain at historically low levels with uneven improvement across our operating markets 

we believe our business is wellpositioned to benefit from a housing recovery due to our strong balance sheet and liquidity our finished lot position our inventory of available homes and our broad geographic operating base which have allowed us to profitably grow our business in the current market conditions we have begun increasing our investments in land lot and home inventories in response to increased demand for our homes and we will continue to adjust our business strategies based on housing demand in each of our markets nevertheless our future results could be negatively impacted by weakening economic conditions decreases in the level of employment a significant increase in mortgage interest rates or further tightening of mortgage lending standards 

strategy 

while we are encouraged by the recent improvement in new home demand we are uncertain whether homebuilding industry conditions will continue to improve at the pace we experienced in fiscal 2012 we expect that further improvement in individual markets will be uneven and will be largely dependent on local economic conditions however we believe our strategy through the downturn of generating significant cash flow from operations increasing our cash balances reducing our outstanding debt and controlling attractive land and lot positions through option contracts has positioned us to capitalize on improving demand across our markets in response to increasing new home demand we are using our liquidity and strong balance sheet to provide the capital and capacity to increase our investments in housing and land inventory geographically expand our operations opportunistically pursue business acquisitions and grow our profitability our operating strategy includes the following initiatives 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our operating strategy produced positive results in fiscal 2012 however we cannot provide any assurances that the initiatives listed above will continue to be successful and we may need to adjust components of our strategy to meet future market conditions if market conditions do not deteriorate from current levels we expect that our operating strategy will allow us to grow our profitability while maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity position in fiscal 2013

the value of net sales orders increased 29  to 48033 million   21048  homes in 2012  from 37276 million   17421  homes in 2011  the number of net sales orders increased 21  in fiscal 2012  compared to fiscal 2011  reflecting an increase in sales demand for our homes while the improvement in our sales as compared to the prior year reflects improvement in new home demand and market conditions overall demand for new homes remains at a historically low level 

in comparing fiscal 2012  to fiscal 2011  the volume of net sales orders increased in all six of our market regions the largest percentage increases occurred in our southeast and southwest regions as a result of improved market conditions in the majority of our florida markets and in our phoenix market sales orders in our southeast region were also positively impacted by our acquisition of the homebuilding operations of breland homes during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 which added 118  homes and 243 million  to our net sales in fiscal 2012 subsequent to the acquisition date changes in the value of net sales orders were generally due to the change in the number of homes sold in each respective region and to a lesser extent to increases in the average selling price of those homes reflective of improving market conditions our future sales volumes will depend on the strength of the overall economy employment levels and our ability to successfully implement our operating strategies in each of our markets 

the average price of our net sales orders increased 7  to 228200  in 2012  from 214000  in 2011  the increase reflects slight increases in the average size and amenity levels of our homes sold as well as small price increases we have been able to implement recently in some of our communities as demand for new homes has improved 

our sales order cancellation rate cancelled sales orders divided by gross sales orders for the period was 24  in fiscal 2012  compared to 27  in fiscal 2011  while our cancellation rates have improved they remain slightly higher than they were prior to the recent housing downturn and are mainly reflective of tight mortgage lending standards 



sales order backlog 

sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies including mortgage loan approval and buyers selling their existing homes which can result in cancellations a portion of the contracts in backlog will not result in closings due to cancellations our homes in backlog at september 30 2012  increased 49  from the prior year with significant increases in most regions due to increases in net sales orders as compared with the prior year the sales order backlog in the southeast region at september 30 2012 included the impact of our acquisition of the homebuilding operations of breland homes during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 



home sales revenue 

revenues from home sales increased 19  to 42184 million   18890  homes closed in 2012  from 35423 million   16695  homes closed in 2011  the average selling price of homes closed during 2012  was 223300  up 5  from the 212200  average in 2011  reflecting slight increases in the average size and amenity levels of our homes closed as well as small price increases we have been able to implement recently in some of our communities as demand for new homes has improved during fiscal 2012  home sales revenues increased in all of our market regions resulting from increases in the number of homes closed and increases in average selling prices 

the number of homes closed in fiscal 2012  increased 13  from 2011  due to increases in all of our market regions the most significant percentage increase in the current year occurred in our southeast region with the florida markets contributing the most to the increase home closings in the southeast region also benefited from our acquisition of the homebuilding operations of breland homes during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 which added 114  home closings and 224 million  to our home sales revenue in fiscal 2012 subsequent to the acquisition date 

homebuilding operating margin analysis 



home sales gross profit 

gross profit from home sales increased by 30  to 7455 million  in 2012  from 5713 million in 2011  and as a percentage of home sales revenues increased   160 basis points to 177  approximately 130  basis points of the increase in the home sales gross profit percentage was a result of the average selling price of our homes increasing by more than the average cost reflecting improved market conditions from the prior year approximately 40  basis points of the increase was due to a decrease in the amortization of capitalized interest and property taxes as a percentage of homes sales revenues resulting from reductions in our interest and property taxes incurred and capitalized and more closings occurring on recently acquired finished lots these increases were partially offset by a 10  basis point decrease due to a 53 million outofperiod adjustment in the prior year period related to an error in recording the loss reserves of our 100 owned captive insurance subsidiary that increased gross profit in 2011 

land sales and other revenues 

land sales and other revenues increased to 178 million  in 2012  from 73 million  in 2011  fluctuations in revenues from land sales are a function of how we manage our inventory levels in various markets we generally purchase land and lots with the intent to build and sell homes on them however we occasionally purchase land that includes commercially zoned parcels which we typically sell to commercial developers and we also sell residential lots or land parcels to manage our land and lot supply land and lot sales occur at unpredictable intervals and varying degrees of profitability therefore the revenues and gross profit from land sales fluctuate from period to period as of september 30 2012  we had 326 million  of land held for sale that we expect to sell in the next twelve months 

included in land sales and other revenues is revenue from a single longterm construction project in which we serve as the general contractor revenue is recognized on a percentageofcompletion basis as the construction is completed in fiscal 2012 the revenue and gross profit related to this project was 65 million  and 12 million  respectively 

inventory impairments and land option cost writeoffs 

during fiscal 2012  we performed our quarterly inventory impairment analyses by reviewing the performance and outlook for all of our land inventories and communities under development for indicators of potential impairment based on this review as of september 30 2012  we then performed impairment evaluations of communities with a combined carrying value of 2169 million  through these evaluations we determined that communities with a carrying value of 18 million  as of september 30 2012  were impaired as a result during the three months ended september 30 2012  we recorded impairment charges of 06 million  to reduce the carrying value of the impaired communities to their estimated fair value as compared to 102 million  of impairment charges in the same period of 2011  during fiscal 2012  and 2011  impairment charges totaled 32 million  and 373 million  respectively the decrease in the amount of impairment charges in fiscal 2012  reflects the overall improvement of housing industry conditions and our increased profitability compared to the prior year which has significantly reduced the number of our communities and carrying value of inventories that have indicators of potential impairment 

it is possible that our estimate of undiscounted cash flows from these communities may change and could result in a future need to record impairment charges to adjust the carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair value if conditions in the broader economy homebuilding industry or specific markets in which we operate worsen and as we reevaluate specific community pricing and incentives construction and development plans and our overall land sale strategies we may be required to evaluate additional communities or reevaluate previously impaired communities for potential impairment these evaluations may result in additional impairment charges 

during fiscal 2012  and 2011  we wrote off 30 million  and 81 million  respectively of earnest money deposits and land option costs related to land option contracts which are not expected to be acquired at september 30 2012  outstanding earnest money deposits associated with our portfolio of land and lot option purchase contracts totaled 350 million  

the inventory impairment charges and writeoffs of earnest money deposits and land option costs reduced total homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding revenues by approximately 10 basis points in fiscal 2012  compared to 130 basis points in fiscal 2011  

selling general and administrative sga expense 

sga expense from homebuilding activities increased   10  to 5287 million  in 2012  from 4800 million  in 2011  as a percentage of homebuilding revenues sga expense decreased   100 basis points to 125  in 2012  from 135  in 2011  the largest component of our homebuilding sga expense is employee compensation and related costs which represented 63  and 60  of sga costs in 2012  and 2011  respectively these costs increased  by 17  to 3356 million  in 2012  from 2865 million  in 2011  primarily due to an increase in the level of incentive compensation related to the significant increases in revenues profitability and the price of our common stock in the current year as compared to the prior year our homebuilding operations employed approximately 2740  and 2380 employees at september 30 2012  and 2011  respectively 

interest incurred 

homebuilding interest costs are incurred on our homebuilding debt outstanding during the period comparing fiscal 2012  with fiscal 2011  interest incurred related to homebuilding debt decreased   7  to 1208 million  corresponding to a 7   decrease  in our average homebuilding debt 

we capitalize homebuilding interest to inventory during active development and construction our inventory under active development and construction is currently lower than our debt level therefore a portion of our interest incurred is expensed we expensed 236 million  of homebuilding interest during fiscal 2012  compared to 505 million  of interest during 2011  the reduction in interest expensed during the current year is a result of an increase in our inventory under active development and construction as well as the decline in interest incurred interest amortized to cost of sales excluding interest written off with inventory impairment charges declined to 27  of total home and landlot cost of sales in fiscal 2012  from 30  in fiscal 2011  as a result of more home closings on recently acquired finished lots and decreases in construction times over the past year 

gainloss on early retirement of debt 

during fiscal 2012  we retired 108 million  principal amount of our senior notes prior to their maturity during fiscal 2011  in addition to repaying 1762 million  principal amount of maturing senior notes we retired 3192 million  principal amount of our senior notes prior to their maturity as a result of the early retirement of these notes we recognized a net gain of 01 million  and a net loss of 108 million  in fiscal 2012  and 2011  respectively these amounts represent the difference between the principal amount of the notes and the aggregate purchase price after the writeoff of any unamortized discounts and fees 

  

other income 

other income net of other expenses included in our homebuilding operations was 121 million  in 2012  compared to 80 million  in 2011  other income consists of interest income rental income and various other types of income not directly associated with our core homebuilding activities the largest component of other income in both years was interest income 

acquisitions 

in august 2012 we acquired the homebuilding operations of breland homes for 1059 million  in cash of which 94 million  was paid subsequent to september 30 2012 breland homes operates in huntsville and mobile in alabama and along the gulf coast of mississippi the assets acquired primarily included approximately 300  homes in inventory 1000  finished lots and control of approximately 3700  additional lots through option contracts we also acquired a sales order backlog of 228  homes valued at 469 million  the acquisition of the homebuilding operations of breland homes was not material to our results of operations or financial condition

land and lot position and homes in inventory 

our inventory investment strategy includes entering into new lot option contracts to purchase finished lots in our operating markets where possible and we attempt to renegotiate existing lot option contracts when necessary to reduce our lot costs and better match the scheduled lot purchases with new home demand in each community we are also increasing our investments in land acquisition land development and housing inventory to meet housing demand and expand our operations in desirable markets we manage our inventory of homes under construction relative to demand in each of our markets including starting construction on unsold homes to capture new home demand monitoring the number and aging of unsold homes and aggressively marketing our unsold completed homes in inventory 

the following is a summary of our land and lot position and homes in inventory at september 30 2012  and 2011  



 

 

at september 30 2012  we owned or controlled approximately 152700  lots compared to approximately 112700  lots at september 30 2011  of the 152700  total lots we controlled approximately 58100  lots  38  with a total remaining purchase price of approximately 17 billion  through land and lot option purchase contracts with a total of 350 million  in earnest money deposits at september 30 2012  approximately 24700  of our owned lots were finished

fiscal year ended september 30 2011  compared to fiscal year ended september 30 2010   

the following tables and related discussion set forth key operating and financial data for our homebuilding operations by reporting segment as of and for the fiscal years ended september 30 2011  and 2010  





 

 

net sales orders 

the value of net sales orders decreased 7  to 37276 million   17421  homes in 2011  from 40110 million   19375  homes in 2010  the number of net sales orders decreased 10  in fiscal 2011  compared to fiscal 2010  sales order volume during the first part of fiscal 2010  benefited from the federal homebuyer tax credit during the last half of fiscal 2011  the number and value of our net sales orders were 2 and 8 higher respectively than in the last half of fiscal 2010  

in comparing fiscal 2011  to fiscal 2010  the value and volume of net sales orders decreased in most of our market regions with much of the volume decrease resulting from the expiration of the federal homebuyer tax credit the volume decline in our southwest region also reflected weaker market conditions in all of its markets combined with a reduction in the number of active communities during fiscal 2011  our east and southeast regions experienced slight increases in net sales orders as a result of operating more communities during fiscal 2011  fluctuations in the value of net sales orders were primarily due to the change in the number of homes sold in each respective region and to a lesser extent to small fluctuations in the average selling price of those homes 

the average price of our net sales orders in 2011  was 214000  an increase of 3  from the 207000  average in 2010  the largest percentage increases were in our southwest and west regions and were primarily due to opening new communities and adjusting our product mix with higher priced communities representing more of our sales 

our annual sales order cancellation rate was 27  in fiscal 2011  compared to 26  in fiscal 2010  these cancellation rates were above historical levels reflecting the challenges in most of our homebuilding markets 



sales order backlog 

our homes in backlog at september 30 2011  increased 18  from the prior year with significant increases in our east midwest and southeast regions the number of homes in backlog in these regions benefited from more active communities and improved third and fourth quarter sales as compared with the same periods of the prior year 



home sales revenue 

revenues from home sales decreased 18  to 35423 million   16695  homes closed in 2011  from 43023 million   20875  homes closed in 2010  the average selling price of homes closed during 2011  was 212200  up 3  from the 206100  average in 2010  which reflected a change in product mix rather than broad price appreciation during fiscal 2011  home sales revenues decreased in all of our market regions resulting from decreases in the number of homes closed 

the number of homes closed in fiscal 2011  decreased 20  due to decreases in all of our market regions the federal homebuyer tax credit helped stimulate demand for new homes during fiscal 2010  and following its expiration we experienced a significant decline in demand for our homes that extended into fiscal 2011 



home sales gross profit 

gross profit from home sales decreased  by 23  to 5713 million  in 2011  from 7440 million  in 2010  and as a percentage of home sales revenues decreased   120 basis points to 161  the reduction in gross profit from home sales was primarily due to the increased levels of incentives and discounts needed to sell homes in fiscal 2011  which narrowed the range between our selling prices and costs of our homes in most of our markets fiscal 2010  benefited from the federal homebuyer tax credit which created demand for our homes without the need for us to provide as many incentives and discounts 

inventory impairments and land option cost writeoffs 

as of september 30 2011  we evaluated communities with a combined carrying value of 3915 million  for impairment through this evaluation process we determined that communities with a carrying value of 371 million  as of september 30 2011  were impaired as a result during the three months ended september 30 2011  we recorded impairment charges of 102 million  to reduce the carrying value of the impaired communities to their estimated fair value as compared to 291 million  in the same period of 2010  during fiscal 2011  and 2010  impairment charges totaled 373 million  and 623 million  respectively 

during fiscal 2011  and 2010  we wrote off 81 million  and 24 million  respectively of earnest money deposits and costs related to land option contracts the inventory impairment charges and writeoffs of earnest money deposits and land option costs reduced total homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding revenues by approximately 130 basis points in fiscal 2011  compared to 150  basis points in fiscal 2010  

selling general and administrative sga expense 

sga expense from homebuilding activities decreased   8  to 4800 million  in 2011  from 5232 million  in 2010  as a percentage of homebuilding revenues sga expense increased   140 basis points to 135  in 2011  from 121  in 2010  the largest component of our homebuilding sga expense is employee compensation and related costs which represented 60  and 58  of sga costs in 2011  and 2010  respectively these costs decreased  by 6  to 2865 million  in 2011  from 3040 million  in 2010  primarily due to a decline in the level of incentive compensation and to a lesser extent to a decline in the number of employees our homebuilding operations employed approximately 2380  and 2500 employees at september 30 2011  and 2010  respectively a reduction in advertising costs also contributed to the decline in sga expense 

interest incurred 

comparing fiscal 2011  with fiscal 2010  interest incurred related to homebuilding debt decreased 25  to 1302 million  primarily due to a 26   decrease  in our average homebuilding debt we expensed 505 million  of homebuilding interest during fiscal 2011  compared to 863 million  of interest during fiscal 2010  the reduction in interest expensed is a result of a decline in interest incurred interest amortized to cost of sales excluding interest written off with inventory impairment charges declined to 30  of total home and landlot cost of sales in fiscal 2011  from 34  in 2010  as a result of more home closings on acquired finished lots and decreases in construction times 

loss on early retirement of debt 

during fiscal 2011  in addition to repaying maturing senior notes we retired 3192 million  principal amount of our senior notes prior to their maturity compared to 8222 million  in fiscal 2010  related to the early retirement of these notes we recognized a net loss of 108 million  and 49 million  in fiscal 2011  and 2010  respectively the net loss in fiscal 2011  includes a loss of 63 million for the call premium and writeoff of unamortized fees related to the early redemption of our 5375 senior notes due 2012 the net loss in fiscal 2010  includes a loss of 20 million for the call premium and writeoff of unamortized fees related to the early redemption of the 5875 senior notes due 2013 

other income 

other income net of other expenses associated with homebuilding activities was 80 million  in 2011  compared to 104 million  in 2010  the largest component of other income in both years was interest income

the volume of loans originated and brokered by our mortgage operations is directly related to the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations in fiscal 2012  total firstlien loans originated or brokered by dhi mortgage for our homebuyers increased by 9  reflective of the 13  increase in the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations the percentage increase in loans originated was lower than the percentage increase in the number of homes closed due to a slight decrease in our mortgage capture rate the percentage of total home closings by our homebuilding operations for which dhi mortgage handled the homebuyers’ financing to 59  in fiscal 2012  from 61  in fiscal 2011  

home closings from our homebuilding operations constituted 84  of dhi mortgage loan originations in 2012  compared to 85  in 2011  reflecting dhi mortgage’s continued focus on the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations 

the number of loans sold to thirdparty purchasers increased by 13  in 2012  compared to 2011  corresponding to the 11  increase in the number of loans originated between the years virtually all of the mortgage loans originated during fiscal 2012  and mortgage loans held for sale on september 30 2012  were eligible for sale to the federal national mortgage association fannie mae federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac or government national mortgage association ginnie mae approximately 73  of the mortgage loans sold by dhi mortgage during fiscal 2012  were sold to one major financial institution that provided better pricing and execution than other available loan purchasers on an ongoing basis we seek to establish additional loan purchase arrangements with multiple institutions if we are unable to sell mortgage loans to additional purchasers on attractive terms our ability to originate and sell mortgage loans at competitive prices could be limited which would negatively affect profitability 

financial services revenues and expenses 

revenues from the financial services segment increased 35  to 1178 million  in fiscal 2012  from 872 million  in fiscal 2011  the volume of loans sold increased 13  while revenues from the sale of servicing rights and gains from sale of mortgages increased 39  loan sale revenue increased at a higher rate than loan sale volume primarily due to improved loan sale execution in the secondary market loan origination fees increased 3  compared to an 11  increase in the number of loans originated the percentage increase in loan origination fees was lower than the percentage increase in the number of loans originated due to pricing changes in some of our markets and was generally offset by improved loan sale execution 

charges related to recourse obligations were 47 million  in fiscal 2012  compared to 116 million  in fiscal 2011  the calculation of our required repurchase loss reserve is based upon an analysis of repurchase requests received our actual repurchases and losses through the disposition of such loans or requests discussions with our mortgage purchasers and analysis of the mortgages we originated while we believe that we have adequately reserved for losses on known and projected repurchase requests if either actual repurchases or the losses incurred resolving those repurchases exceed our expectations additional recourse expense may be incurred additionally a subsidiary of ours reinsured a portion of the private mortgage insurance written on loans originated by dhi mortgage in prior years charges to increase reserves for expected losses on the reinsured loans were 15 million  and 18 million  during fiscal 2012  and 2011  respectively 

financial services general and administrative ga expense increased 12  to 855 million  in 2012  from 763 million  in 2011  as a percentage of financial services revenues excluding the effects of recourse and reinsurance expense ga expense decreased to 690  in 2012  from 758  in 2011  primarily due to the increase in loan origination volume and revenues fluctuations in financial services ga expense as a percentage of revenues can be expected to occur as some expenses are not directly related to mortgage loan volume or to changes in the amount of revenue earned

mortgage loan activity 

total firstlien loans originated or brokered by dhi mortgage for our homebuyers decreased by 19  in fiscal 2011  compared to fiscal 2010  corresponding to the 20  decrease in the number of homes closed our mortgage capture rate was 61  in both years 

home closings from our homebuilding operations constituted 85  of dhi mortgage loan originations in 2011  compared to 90  in 2010  reflecting dhi mortgage’s continued focus on the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations the relatively lower captive percentage in 2011  reflects a higher level of refinancing and new mortgage loan originations from nonhomebuilding sources than in 2010  

the number of loans sold to thirdparty purchasers decreased by 15  in 2011  compared to 2010  corresponding to the 14  decrease in the number of loans originated between the years virtually all of the mortgage loans originated during fiscal 2011  and mortgage loans held for sale on september 30 2011  were eligible for sale to fannie mae freddie mac or ginnie mae approximately 89  of the mortgage loans sold by dhi mortgage during fiscal 2011  were sold to two major financial institutions pursuant to their loan purchase agreements 

financial services revenues and expenses 

revenues from the financial services segment decreased 4  to 872 million  in fiscal 2011  from 905 million  in fiscal 2010  revenues from the sale of servicing rights and gains from sale of mortgages decreased 11  as a result of a 15  decrease in the volume of loans sold loan origination fees increased 3  despite a 14  decrease in loans originated due to small changes in pricing structure implemented during fiscal 2011  charges related to recourse obligations were 116 million  in fiscal 2011  compared to 137 million  in fiscal 2010  charges to increase reserves for expected losses on the reinsured loans were 18 million  and 19 million  during fiscal 2011  and 2010  respectively 

financial services ga expense was 763 million  in 2011  decreasing slightly from 772 million  in 2010  as a percentage of financial services revenues excluding the effects of recourse and reinsurance expense ga expense increased to 758  in 2011  from 728  in 2010  the increase was due to the reduction in revenues resulting from the decrease in mortgage loan volume compared to fiscal 2010  

results of operations — consolidated 

fiscal year ended september 30 2012  compared to fiscal year ended september 30 2011 

income before income taxes 

income before income taxes for fiscal 2012  was 2429 million  compared to 121 million  for fiscal 2011  the difference in our operating results for the current year compared to a year ago is primarily due to higher revenues from increased home closings a higher gross profit margin and lower interest expense 

income taxes 

in fiscal 2012  our income tax benefit was 7134 million  compared to a benefit of 597 million  in 2011  the income tax benefit in fiscal 2012  was due primarily to a significant reduction of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance during the three months ended june 30 2012 the income tax benefit in fiscal 2011  was due to us receiving a favorable result from the internal revenue service irs on a ruling request concerning capitalization of inventory costs we do not have meaningful effective tax rates in these years because our net deferred tax assets were fully offset by a valuation allowance until the third quarter of fiscal 2012  when we reduced the valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset based on current income tax laws we expect our effective tax rate in fiscal 2013 to be approximately 385  

at september 30 2012  we had federal net operating loss nol carryforwards of 3105 million  that expire in fiscal 2030 and 2031 and tax benefits for state nol carryforwards of 852 million  that expire beginning at various times depending on the tax jurisdiction from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2031 at september 30 2012  we had federal tax credit carryforwards of 44 million  that expire in fiscal years 2029 through 2032 and a minimum tax credit carryforward of 26 million  

at september 30 2012  and 2011  we had deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities of 7514 million  and 8485 million  respectively offset by valuation allowances of 419 million  and 8485 million  respectively the realization of our deferred tax assets depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income in future periods we have a valuation allowance of 419 million  at september 30 2012  because it is more likely than not that a portion of our state nol carryforwards will not be realized due to the more limited carryforward periods that exist in certain states 

  

at june 30 2012 we evaluated both positive and negative evidence and determined it was more likely than not that the substantial majority of our deferred tax assets would be realized which resulted in a significant reduction of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 

in our evaluation of the need for and level of a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets at june 30 2012 the most significant piece of evidence considered was the objective direct positive evidence related to our recent financial results including our positive and growing levels of pretax income and our strong growth in net sales orders and sales order backlog these positive pretax income sales and backlog levels and trends continued through september 30 2012 we believe we will continue to increase our pretax income in future years as we are utilizing our balance sheet and liquidity position to invest in opportunities to sustain and grow our operations if industry conditions weaken from current levels we expect to be able to adjust our operations to maintain longterm profitability while our expectations are that annual pretax income will grow from the fiscal 2012 level if annual pretax income in future years remains flat with the current level we estimate that we will realize all of our current federal net operating losses in less than five years and will be able to absorb all federal deductible temporary differences as they reverse in future years 

prior to the quarter ended june 30 2012 a significant part of the negative evidence we considered was our threeyear cumulative pretax loss position which had become a cumulative pretax income position at june 30 2012 and was no longer considered to be as significant other negative evidence we considered was our previous losses incurred during the housing market decline the current overall weakness in the economy and the housing market the restrictive mortgage lending environment and our gross margins which are currently lower than historical levels before the housing downturn based on our evaluation of both positive and negative evidence at june 30 2012 we concluded that the objective direct positive evidence related to our operating results achieved during the recent challenging economic and housing market conditions and the sustainability of current pretax income levels outweighed the negative evidence and that it was more likely than not that the substantial majority of our deferred tax assets will be realized 

the accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future results could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position changes in existing tax laws and tax rates also affect actual tax results and the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 

unrecognized tax benefits are the differences between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefits recognized for accounting purposes included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits as of september 30 2012  are 118 million  of tax benefits that if recognized would reduce our income tax expense also included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits as of september 30 2012  are 23 million  of tax benefits that if recognized would result in an adjustment to deferred income taxes at september 30 2011  all tax positions if recognized would have reduced our income tax expense because of the full valuation allowance that existed on our deferred tax assets 

we classify interest expense and penalties on income taxes as income tax expense during fiscal 2012  and 2011  we recognized interest benefits related to unrecognized tax benefits of 01 million  and 127 million  respectively in our consolidated statements of operations at both september 30 2012  and 2011  our total accrued interest expense relating to unrecognized tax benefits was 51 million  and there were no  accrued penalties 

a reduction of 99 million  in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits and 31 million  of accrued interest is reasonably possible within the next 12 months of which 110 million  would be reflected as an income tax benefit in our consolidated statement of operations and 20 million  would result in an adjustment to deferred income taxes 

we are subject to federal income tax and to income tax in multiple states the statute of limitations for our major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for fiscal years 2004 to 2006 and from 2008 through 2012 we are currently being audited by various states 

at september 30 2012  and 2011  we had income taxes receivable of 144 million  and 124 million  respectively for expected federal tax refunds related to our 2006 and 2007 tax returns during fiscal 2012 the irs concluded its audit of our 2006 and 2007 tax returns and the us congressional joint committee on taxation concluded its review of the tax refunds requested by us in october 2012 we received the 144 million  tax refund 

fiscal year ended september 30 2011  compared to fiscal year ended september 30 2010   

income before income taxes 

income before income taxes for fiscal 2011  was 121 million  compared to 995 million  for fiscal 2010  the difference in our operating results for 2011  compared to 2010  is primarily due to a lower volume of homes closed which resulted in lower revenues 

income taxes 

in fiscal 2011  our income tax benefit was 597 million  compared to a benefit of 1456 million  in 2010  the income tax benefit in fiscal 2011  was due to the reduction of our accrual for unrecognized tax benefits and corresponding interest by 614 million partially offset by an accrual for state income taxes of 17 million in fiscal 2010  a tax law change regarding net operating loss nol carrybacks resulted in an income tax benefit of 2083 million  which was partially offset by an increase in unrecognized tax benefits and state income tax expense we did not have meaningful effective tax rates in these years because our net deferred tax assets were fully offset by a valuation allowance 

at september 30 2011  and 2010  we had income taxes receivable of 124 million  and 160 million  respectively we had deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities of 8485 million  and 9026 million  respectively offset by valuation allowances of 8485 million  and 9026 million  respectively in determining the continued need for a valuation allowance with respect to our deferred tax assets a significant part of the negative evidence we considered came from our threeyear cumulative pretax loss position which was 445 million  at the end of fiscal 2011  

at september 30 2011  and 2010  the total amount of our unrecognized tax benefits was 163 million  and 650 million  respectively the decrease in unrecognized tax benefits resulted from us receiving a favorable result from the irs on a ruling request concerning the capitalization of inventory costs and a reduction in our accrual for state income tax issues related to unrecognized tax benefits we recognized an interest benefit of 127 million  and interest expense of 116 million  during fiscal 

2011  and 2010  respectively at september 30 2011  and 2010  our total accrued interest expense relating to unrecognized tax benefits was 51 million and 178 million respectively and there were no accrued penalties 

overview of capital resources and liquidity 

we have historically funded our homebuilding and financial services operations with cash flows from operating activities borrowings under bank credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities during the industry downturn from 2007 to 2011 we generated substantial cash flows primarily through reductions in assets and income tax refunds which allowed us to increase our liquidity and reduce our debt this has provided us with the operational flexibility to adjust to changing homebuilding market conditions in response to increased demand for our homes we have recently increased our investments in housing and land inventory opportunities to expand our operations and grow our profitability we intend to maintain adequate liquidity and balance sheet strength and we regularly evaluate opportunities to access the capital markets as they become available 

at september 30 2012  our ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital was 214  an increase of 340 basis points from 180  at september 30 2011  net homebuilding debt to total capital consists of homebuilding notes payable net of cash and marketable securities divided by total capital net of cash and marketable securities homebuilding notes payable net of cash and marketable securities plus total equity in the near term we intend to maintain a ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital below our historic target operating range of 40  to 45  however future net homebuilding debt to total capital ratios may be higher than current levels 

we believe that the ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital is useful in understanding the leverage employed in our homebuilding operations and comparing our capital structure with other homebuilders we exclude the debt of our financial services business because it is separately capitalized and its obligation under its repurchase agreement is substantially collateralized and not guaranteed by our parent company or any of our homebuilding entities because of their capital function we include our homebuilding cash and marketable securities as a reduction of our homebuilding debt and total capital for comparison to our ratios of net homebuilding debt to capital above at september 30 2012  and 2011  our ratios of homebuilding debt to total capital without netting cash and marketable securities balances were 391  and 377  respectively 

we believe that our existing cash resources our revolving credit facility and our mortgage repurchase facility provide sufficient liquidity to fund our nearterm working capital needs and debt obligations we regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund future growth in our business repay our longerterm debt obligations and support our other general corporate and operational needs and we regularly evaluate our opportunities to raise additional capital we have an automatically effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec in september 2012 registering debt and equity securities which we may issue from time to time in amounts to be determined as market conditions permit we may issue new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets or obtain additional bank financing to fund our projected capital requirements or provide additional liquidity 

homebuilding capital resources 

cash and cash equivalents  — at september 30 2012  we had available homebuilding cash and cash equivalents of 10 billion  

marketable securities  — at september 30 2012  we had marketable securities of 2980 million  our marketable securities consist of us treasury securities government agency securities corporate debt securities and certificates of deposit 

recently issued public unsecured debt  in may 2012 we issued 350 million  principal amount of 475 senior notes due may 15 2017  with interest payable semiannually the annual effective interest rate of the notes after giving effect to the amortization of deferred financing costs is 50  

in september 2012 we issued 350 million  principal amount of 4375 senior notes due september 15 2022  with interest payable semiannually the annual effective interest rate of the notes after giving effect to the amortization of deferred financing costs is 45  

bank credit facility  — in september 2012  we entered into a five year 125 million  senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a major bank as of september 30 2012 the facility had an uncommitted 375 million  accordion feature which could increase the size of the facility subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments borrowings bear interest at rates based upon the london interbank offered rate libor plus an applicable margin as determined by our leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement governing the facility the facility also provided for the issuance of letters of credit equal to 50  of the revolving credit commitment through a letter of credit sublimit at september 30 2012  we had no  borrowings outstanding and 04 million  in letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility on november 1 2012 we increased the capacity of the credit facility to 600 million  by obtaining additional lending commitments from banks and increased the accordion feature available under the facility to allow us to increase the size of the facility to 10 billion  subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments the amended sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit is now 300 million  

our revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on our operations and activities including requiring the maintenance of a minimum level of tangible net worth a maximum allowable leverage ratio and a borrowing base restriction if our leverage ratio exceeds a certain level these covenants are measured as defined in the credit facility and are reported to our lenders quarterly in addition our credit facility and the indentures governing the senior notes impose restrictions on the creation of secured debt and liens at september 30 2012  we were in compliance with all of the covenants limitations and restrictions of our revolving credit facility and public debt obligations a failure to comply with these financial covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under the revolving credit facility or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity 

secured letter of credit agreements  — we have secured letter of credit agreements which require us to deposit cash in an amount approximating the balance of letters of credit outstanding as collateral with the issuing banks at september 30 2012  and 2011  the amount of cash restricted for this purpose totaled 472 million  and 475 million  respectively and is included in homebuilding restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheets the amount of cash restricted at september 30 2012  includes cash collateral related to the letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility 

financial services capital resources 

cash and cash equivalents  — at september 30 2012  the amount of financial services cash and cash equivalents was 173 million  

mortgage repurchase facility  — our mortgage subsidiary dhi mortgage has a mortgage repurchase facility that is accounted for as a secured financing the mortgage repurchase facility provides financing and liquidity to dhi mortgage by facilitating purchase transactions in which dhi mortgage transfers eligible loans to the counterparties against the transfer of funds by the counterparties thereby becoming purchased loans dhi mortgage then has the right and obligation to repurchase the purchased loans upon their sale to thirdparty purchasers in the secondary market or within specified time frames from 45 to 120 days in accordance with the terms of the mortgage repurchase facility in march 2012  the mortgage repurchase facility was amended and renewed through march 3 2013  the committed capacity of the facility remains at 180 million  however the capacity can be increased up to 225 million  as needed increases in borrowing capacity in excess of 180 million  are provided on an uncommitted basis and at a higher borrowing cost than committed borrowings 

as of september 30 2012  2786 million  of mortgage loans held for sale with a collateral value of 2639 million  were pledged under the mortgage repurchase facility as a result of advance paydowns totaling 761 million  dhi mortgage had an obligation of 1878 million  outstanding under the mortgage repurchase facility at september 30 2012  at a 28  annual interest rate 

the mortgage repurchase facility is not guaranteed by either dr horton inc or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt the facility contains financial covenants as to the mortgage subsidiary’s minimum required tangible net worth its maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and its minimum required liquidity these covenants are measured and reported monthly at september 30 2012  dhi mortgage was in compliance with all of the conditions and covenants of the mortgage repurchase facility 

in the past our mortgage subsidiary has been able to renew or extend its mortgage credit facility on satisfactory terms prior to its maturity and obtain temporary additional commitments through amendments to the credit agreement during periods of higher than normal volumes of mortgages held for sale the liquidity of our financial services business depends upon its 

continued ability to renew and extend the mortgage repurchase facility or to obtain other additional financing in sufficient capacities 

operating cash flow activities 

in fiscal 2012  we used 2981 million  of cash in our operating activities compared to 149 million  provided by our operating activities in fiscal 2011  which reflects cash used to invest in additional land and lot inventory and homes under construction as market conditions improved during 2012 offset by cash provided by net income and increases in payables and other liabilities 

we have a substantial amount of liquidity which has given us the flexibility to invest capital to grow our operations as our sales demand and profitability has improved we have used cash from operating activities to increase our homes in inventory and invest in land acquisition land development and housing inventory opportunities to meet housing demand and expand our operations in desirable markets over the past several years our land investments had been primarily purchases of finished lots in most of our markets in fiscal 2012 we began increasing our investments in undeveloped land and land development spending as the supply of finished lots declined in many of our markets we expect a larger portion of our investments will shift from finished lot purchases to land acquisition and development which will result in increased inventory levels 

investing cash flow activities 

in fiscal 2012  net cash used in our investing activities was 1383 million  compared to 193 million  in fiscal 2011  the most significant investing use of cash in fiscal 2012  relative to fiscal 2011  was the purchase of the homebuilding operations of breland homes whereby 965 million  of the purchase price was paid during the year also purchases of property and equipment to support our operations including model home furniture office and technology equipment and office buildings were 336 million  in fiscal 2012  as compared to 163 million  in fiscal 2011  

financing cash flow activities 

during the past few years most of our shortterm financing needs have been funded with cash generated from operations and borrowings available under our financial services credit facility longterm financing needs of our homebuilding operations have historically been funded with the issuance of senior unsecured debt securities through the public capital markets going forward the shortterm financing needs of our homebuilding operations will be funded with existing cash cash generated from profits and borrowings available under our new revolving credit facility 

during fiscal 2012  financing activities provided 7515 million  of cash primarily from our issuances of 350 million  principal amount of 475 senior notes and 350 million  of 4375 senior notes and our borrowing of 713 million  under our mortgage repurchase facility during fiscal 2011  we used 5723 million  in financing activities as we repaid through maturities redemptions and repurchases a total of 4954 million  principal amount of various issues of senior notes for an aggregate purchase price of 5053 million  plus accrued interest during fiscal 2011  we also used cash to repurchase 3544838  shares of our common stock at a total cost of 386 million  

consistent with dividends paid in fiscal 2010  and 2011  our board of directors approved four quarterly cash dividends of 00375  per common share during fiscal 2012  the last of these was paid on august 24 2012  to stockholders of record on august 13 2012  on november 8 2012  our board of directors approved a cash dividend of 00375  per common share payable on december 17 2012  to stockholders of record on december 3 2012  the declaration of future cash dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon among other things future earnings cash flows capital requirements our financial condition and general business conditions 

changes in capital structure 

effective august 1 2012  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 500 million  of debt securities and 100 million  of our common stock effective through july 31 2013  the full amount of each of these authorizations was remaining at september 30 2012  

in may 2012 we issued 350 million  principal amount of 475 senior notes due may 15 2017 and in september 2012  we issued 350 million  principal amount of 4375 senior notes due september 15 2022  

in recent years our primary nonoperating use of available capital has been to repay debt and in fiscal 2011 we also made limited stock repurchases as our sales demand and profitability improved in fiscal 2012 our operating and investing uses of capital increased and our debt repayments decreased as compared to the past several years 

we regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund future growth in our business repay our longerterm debt obligations and support our other general corporate and operational needs and we regularly evaluate our opportunities to raise additional capital as market conditions permit we may issue new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets or obtain additional bank financing to fund our projected capital requirements or provide additional liquidity 

contractual cash obligations commercial commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

our primary contractual cash obligations for our homebuilding and financial services segments are payments under our debt agreements and lease payments under operating leases we expect to fund our contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business through a combination of our existing cash resources cash flows generated from profits renewed amended or new revolving credit facilities mortgage repurchase facilities or other bank financing and the issuance of new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets as market conditions may permit 

our future cash requirements for contractual obligations as of september 30 2012  are presented below 



 

 

at september 30 2012  our homebuilding operations had outstanding letters of credit of 466 million  all of which were cash collateralized and surety bonds of 6984 million  issued by third parties to secure performance under various contracts we expect that our performance obligations secured by these letters of credit and bonds will generally be completed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms when we complete our performance obligations the related letters of credit and bonds are generally released shortly thereafter leaving us with no continuing obligations we have no material thirdparty guarantees 

our mortgage subsidiary enters into various commitments related to the lending activities of our mortgage operations further discussion of these commitments is provided in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” under part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts to acquire land or lots for the construction of homes lot option contracts enable us to control significant lot positions with limited capital investment and substantially reduce the risks associated with land ownership and development within the land and lot option purchase contracts at september 30 2012  there were a limited number of contracts representing 241 million  of remaining purchase price subject to specific performance clauses which may require us to purchase the land or lots upon the land sellers meeting their obligations further discussion of our land option contracts is provided in the “land and lot position and homes in inventory” section included herein 

seasonality 

prior to the recent downturn in the homebuilding industry which began to affect our seasonal patterns in fiscal 2007 we experienced relatively predictable seasonal variations in our quarterly operating results and capital requirements we began to experience our normal seasonal pattern again in both fiscal 2011 and 2012 we generally have more homes under construction close more homes and have greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year the seasonal activity increases our working capital requirements for our homebuilding operations during the third and fourth fiscal quarters and increases our funding requirements for the mortgages we originate in our financial services segment at the end of these quarters as a result of seasonal activity our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year 

inflation 

we may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation primarily because of higher land financing labor and material construction costs in addition higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers we attempt to pass through to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices however during periods when housing market conditions are challenging we may not be able to offset our cost increases with higher selling prices

revenue recognition  — we generally recognize homebuilding revenue and related profit at the time of the closing of a sale when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer in situations where the buyer’s financing is originated by dhi mortgage our 100 owned mortgage subsidiary and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment the profit is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a thirdparty purchaser has been completed any profit on land sales is deferred until the full accrual method criteria are met when appropriate revenue and profit on longterm construction projects are recognized under the percentageofcompletion method 

we include proceeds from home closings held for our benefit at title companies in homebuilding cash when we execute sales contracts with our homebuyers or when we require advance payment from homebuyers for custom changes upgrades or options related to their homes we record the cash deposits received as liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are canceled we either retain or refund to the homebuyer deposits on canceled sales contracts depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances 

we recognize financial services revenues associated with our title operations as closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued both of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed we transfer substantially all underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies to thirdparty insurers we typically elect the fair value option for our mortgage loan originations mortgage loans held for sale are initially recorded at fair value based on either sale commitments or current market quotes and are adjusted for subsequent changes in fair value until the loan is sold net origination costs and fees associated with mortgage loans are recognized at the time of origination the expected net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of a loan are included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings at the time of commitment we generally sell the mortgages we originate and the related servicing rights to thirdparty purchasers interest income is earned from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold 

some mortgage loans are sold with limited recourse provisions based on historical experience discussions with our mortgage purchasers analysis of the mortgages we originated and current housing and credit market conditions we estimate and record a loss reserve for mortgage loans held in portfolio and mortgage loans held for sale as well as known and projected mortgage loan repurchase requests a 20 or 40 increase in the amount of expected mortgage loan repurchases and expected losses on mortgage loan repurchases would result in an increase of approximately 08 million  or 26 million  respectively in our reserve for expected mortgage loan repurchases 

marketable securities  — we invest a portion of our cash on hand by purchasing marketable securities with maturities in excess of three months these securities are held in the custody of a single financial institution we consider our investment portfolio to be availableforsale accordingly these investments are recorded at fair value at the end of a reporting period unrealized gains and losses on these investments net of tax are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the consolidated balance sheet gains and losses realized upon the sale of marketable securities are determined by specific identification and are included in homebuilding other income 

inventories and cost of sales  — inventory includes the costs of direct land acquisition land development and home construction capitalized interest real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and home construction costs that we incur after development projects or homes are substantially complete such as utilities maintenance and cleaning are charged to sga expense as incurred all indirect overhead costs such as compensation of sales personnel division and region management and the costs of advertising and builder’s risk insurance are charged to sga expense as incurred 

land and development costs are typically allocated to individual residential lots on a prorata basis and the costs of residential lots are transferred to construction in progress when home construction begins we use the specific identification method for the purpose of accumulating home construction costs cost of sales for homes closed includes the specific construction costs of each home and all applicable land acquisition land development and related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred allocated to each residential lot based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each community any changes to the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial home closings in a community are allocated on a prorata basis to the homes in the community benefiting from the relevant development activity which generally relates to the remaining homes in the community 

when a home is closed we generally have not paid all incurred costs necessary to complete the home we record as a liability and as a charge to cost of sales the amount we determine will ultimately be paid related to completed homes that have been closed we compare our home construction budgets to actual recorded costs to determine the additional costs remaining to be paid on each closed home we monitor the accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on closed homes in subsequent months to the amount previously accrued although actual costs to be paid in the future on previously closed homes could differ from our current accruals differences in amounts historically have not been significant 

each quarter the performance and outlook of land inventory and communities under development are reviewed for indicators of potential impairment if indicators of impairment are present for a community we perform an impairment evaluation of the community which generally includes an analysis to determine if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts and if so impairment charges are recorded to cost of sales if the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying amounts 

we generally review our inventory for impairment indicators at the community level and the inventory within each community is categorized as land held for development residential land and lots developed and under development andor construction in progress and finished homes based on the stage of production or plans for future development a particular community often includes inventory in more than one category in certain situations inventory may be analyzed separately for impairment purposes based on its product type eg single family homes evaluated separately from condominium parcels in reviewing each of our communities we determine if impairment indicators exist on inventory held and used by analyzing a variety of factors including but not limited to the following 

 

if indicators of impairment are present for a community we perform an impairment evaluation of the community which generally includes an analysis to determine if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts and if so impairment charges are recorded to cost of sales if the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying amounts these estimates of cash flows are significantly impacted by community specific factors including estimates of the amounts and timing of future revenues and estimates of the amount of land development materials and labor costs which in turn may be impacted by the following local market conditions 

 53 

for those assets deemed to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets our determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams when an impairment charge for a community is determined the charge is then allocated to each lot in the community in the same manner as land and development costs are allocated to each lot the inventory within each community is categorized as construction in progress and finished homes residential land and lots developed and under development and land held for development based on the stage of production or plans for future development impairment charges are also recorded on finished homes in substantially completed communities when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values are greater than the fair values less estimated costs to sell these homes 

for the inventory impairment analyses we performed during fiscal 2012 we assumed that for the majority of communities sales prices in future periods will be equal to or lower than current sales order prices in each community or in comparable communities in order to generate an acceptable absorption rate for a minority of communities that we do not intend to develop or operate in current market conditions some increases over current sales prices were assumed the remaining lives of the communities evaluated were estimated to be in a range from six months to in excess of ten years and we utilized a range of discount rates for communities from 12  to 16  

we typically do not purchase land for resale however when we own land or communities under development that do not fit into our development and construction plans and we determine to sell the asset the project is accounted for as land held for sale we record land held for sale at the lesser of its carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell in performing the impairment evaluation for land held for sale we consider several factors including but not limited to prices for land in recent comparable sales transactions market analysis studies which include the estimated price a willing buyer would pay for the land and recent legitimate offers received if the estimated fair value less costs to sell an asset is less than the current carrying value the asset is written down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell 

the key assumptions relating to inventory valuations are impacted by local market economic conditions and the actions of competitors and are inherently uncertain due to uncertainties in the estimation process actual results could differ from such estimates our quarterly assessments reflect management’s estimates and we continue to monitor the fair value of heldforsale assets through the disposition date 

land and lot option purchase contracts  — we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts to acquire land or lots for the construction of homes under these contracts we will fund a stated deposit in consideration for the right but not the obligation to purchase land or lots at a future point in time with predetermined terms under the terms of the option purchase contracts many of our option deposits are not refundable at our discretion 

option deposits and preacquisition costs we incur related to land and lot option purchase contracts are capitalized if all of the following conditions have been met 1 the costs are directly identifiable with the specific property 2 the costs would be capitalized if the property were already acquired and 3 acquisition of the property is probable meaning we are actively seeking and have the ability to acquire the property and there is no indication that the property is not available for sale we consider the following when determining if the acquisition of the property is probable 1 changes in market conditions subsequent to contracting for the purchase of the land 2 current contract terms including per lot price and required purchase dates and 3 our current land position in the given market or submarket option deposits and capitalized preacquisition costs are expensed to cost of sales when we believe it is probable that we will no longer acquire the property under option and will not be able to recover these costs through other means 

occasionally an option purchase contract can result in the creation of a variable interest in the entity holding the land parcel under option we determine if we are the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity based on our ability to control both 1 the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and 2 the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity based on this evaluation if we are the primary beneficiary of an entity with which we have entered into a land or lot option purchase contract the variable interest entity is consolidated creditors if any of these variable interest entities have no recourse against us 

fair value measurements  — the fasb’s authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes a threelevel hierarchy based upon the inputs to the valuation model of an asset or liability the fair value hierarchy and its application to our assets and liabilities is as follows 

 

when available we use quoted market prices in active markets to determine fair value we consider the principal market and nonperformance risk associated with our counterparties when determining the fair value measurements if applicable fair value measurements are used for our marketable securities mortgage loans held for sale interest rate lock commitments irlcs and other derivative instruments on a recurring basis and are used for inventories other mortgage loans and real estate owned on a nonrecurring basis when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

goodwill  — we record goodwill associated with our acquisitions of businesses when the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired we evaluate our goodwill balances for potential impairment on an annual basis the current guidance allows an entity to assess qualitatively whether it is necessary to perform step one of a prescribed twostep annual goodwill impairment test if an entity believes as a result of its qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount the twostep goodwill impairment test is not required we performed a qualitative assessment of our goodwill balances of 389 million  and 159 million  at september 30 2012  and 2011  respectively and determined that the twostep process was not necessary 

warranty claims  — we typically provide our homebuyers with a tenyear limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems a twoyear limited warranty on major mechanical systems and a oneyear limited warranty on other construction components since we subcontract our construction work to subcontractors who typically provide an indemnity and a certificate of insurance prior to receiving payments for their work claims relating to workmanship and materials are generally the primary responsibility of the subcontractors warranty liabilities are established by charging cost of sales for each home delivered the amounts charged are based on management’s estimate of expected warrantyrelated costs under all unexpired warranty obligation periods our warranty liability is based upon historical warranty cost experience in each market in which we operate and is adjusted as appropriate to reflect qualitative risks associated with the types of homes we build and the geographic areas in which we build them actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts a 10 change in the historical warranty rates used to estimate our warranty accrual would not result in a material change in our accrual 

legal claims and insurance  — we are named as a defendant in various claims complaints and other legal actions in the ordinary course of business at any point in time we are managing several hundred individual claims related to construction defect matters personal injury claims employment matters land development issues and contract disputes we have established reserves for these contingencies based on the estimated costs of pending claims and the estimated costs of anticipated future claims related to previously closed homes at both september 30 2012 and 2011 99  of these reserves related to construction defect matters 

our reserves for construction defect claims include the estimated costs of both known claims and anticipated future claims as of september 30 2012 we have reserves for approximately 170  pending construction defect claims and no individual existing claim was material to our financial statements the majority of our total construction defect reserves consists of the estimated exposure to future claims on previously closed homes we have closed a significant number of homes during recent years and as a result we may be subject to future construction defect claims on these homes although regulations vary from state to state construction defect issues can generally be reported for up to ten years after the home has closed in many states in which we operate historical data and trends regarding the frequency of claims incurred and the costs to resolve claims relative to the types of products and markets where we operate are used to estimate the construction defect liabilities for both existing and anticipated future claims these estimates are subject to ongoing revision as the circumstances of individual pending claims and historical data and trends change adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the accounting period in which the change in estimate occurs 

historical trends in construction defect claims have been inconsistent and we believe they may continue to fluctuate over the next several years housing market conditions have been volatile across most of our markets over the past ten years and we believe such conditions can affect the frequency and cost of construction defect claims we closed a significant number of homes during our peak operating years from 2003 to 2007 if the ultimate resolution of construction defect claims resulting from closings in our peak operating years varies from current expectations it could significantly change our estimates regarding the frequency and timing of claims incurred and the costs to resolve existing and anticipated future claims which would impact the construction defect reserves in the future if the frequency of claims incurred or costs of existing and future legal claims significantly exceed our current estimates they will have a significant negative impact on our future earnings and liquidity 

we estimate and record receivables under applicable insurance policies related to our estimated contingencies for known claims and anticipated future construction defect claims on previously closed homes and other legal claims and lawsuits incurred in the ordinary course of business when recovery is probable additionally we may have the ability to recover a portion of our losses from our subcontractors and their insurance carriers when we have been named as an additional insured on their insurance policies 

the estimation of losses related to these reserves and the related estimates of receivables from insurance policies are subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends in construction defect claims relative to our markets and the types of products built claim frequency claim settlement costs and patterns insurance industry practices and legal interpretations among others due to the high degree of judgment required in establishing reserves for these contingencies actual future costs and recoveries from insurance could differ significantly from current estimated amounts a 10 increase in the claim frequency and the average cost per claim used to estimate the reserves would result in an increase of approximately 1377 million  in our reserves and a 733 million  increase in our receivable resulting in additional expense of 644 million  a 10 decrease in the claim frequency and the average cost per claim would result in a decrease of approximately 960 million  in our reserves and a 581 million  decrease in our receivable resulting in a reduction in expense of 379 million  

income taxes  — we calculate our income tax expense benefit using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and of tax loss and credit carryforwards in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income in future periods and in the jurisdictions in which those temporary differences become deductible we record a valuation allowance when we determine it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized in determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns judgment is required the accounting for deferred taxes is based upon an estimate of future results differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position changes in existing tax laws and tax rates also affect actual tax results and the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 

interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in the financial statements as a component of income tax expense significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions we evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis our evaluations are based upon a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change 

stockbased compensation  — from time to time the compensation committee of our board of directors authorizes the issuance of stockbased compensation to our employees and directors the committee approves grants out of amounts remaining available for grant from amounts formally authorized by the common stockholders options are granted at exercise prices which equal the market value of our common stock at the date of the grant the options vest over periods of 2  to 975 years and expire 10 years after the dates on which they were granted 

we measure and recognize compensation expense at an amount equal to the fair value of sharebased payments granted under compensation arrangements for all awards granted or modified after october 1 2005 using the modified prospective method compensation expense for any unvested stock option awards outstanding as of october 1 2005 is recognized on a straightline basis over the remaining vesting period we calculate the fair values of stock options using the blackscholes option pricing model determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions which involve a number of variables these variables include but are not limited to the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards the expected dividend yield and expected stock option exercise behavior in addition we also use judgment in estimating the number of sharebased awards that are expected to be forfeited 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in december 2011 the fasb issued asu 201111 “disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities” which requires entities to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements of financial instruments and derivative instruments the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2013 and is to be applied retrospectively the adoption of this guidance which is related to disclosure only is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in july 2012 the fasb issued asu 201202 “intangibles  goodwill and other” which provides the option to perform a qualitative rather than quantitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired if the asset is considered impaired an entity is required to perform the quantitative assessment under the existing guidance the guidance is effective for our interim and annual impairment tests beginning in fiscal 2013 the adoption of this guidance which is intended to simplify the impairment testing is not expected to impact our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend 

we are subject to interest rate risk on our longterm debt we monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and utilize both fixed and variable rate debt for fixed rate debt changes in interest rates generally affect the value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows conversely for variable rate debt changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument but may affect our future earnings and cash flows except in very limited circumstances we do not have an obligation to prepay fixedrate debt prior to maturity and as a result interest rate risk and changes in fair value would not have a significant impact on our cash flows related to our fixedrate debt until such time as we are required to refinance repurchase or repay such debt 

we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with our mortgage loan origination services we manage interest rate risk through the use of forward sales of mortgagebacked securities mbs eurodollar futures contracts edfc and put options on mbs and edfc use of the term “hedging instruments” in the following discussion refers to these securities collectively or in any combination we do not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate lock commitments irlcs are extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and who meet defined credit and underwriting criteria typically the irlcs have a duration of less than six months some irlcs are committed immediately to a specific purchaser through the use of bestefforts whole loan delivery commitments while other irlcs are funded prior to being committed to thirdparty purchasers the hedging instruments related to irlcs are classified and accounted for as derivative instruments in an economic hedge with gains and losses recognized in current earnings hedging instruments related to funded uncommitted loans are accounted for at fair value with changes recognized in current earnings along with changes in the fair value of the funded uncommitted loans the fair value change related to the hedging instruments generally offsets the fair value change in the uncommitted loans and the fair value change which for the years ended september 30 2012  and 2011  was not significant is recognized in current earnings at september 30 2012  hedging instruments used to mitigate interest rate risk related to uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale and uncommitted irlcs totaled a notional amount of 3665 million  uncommitted irlcs totaled a notional amount of approximately 2871 million  and uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale totaled a notional amount of approximately 1091 million  at september 30 2012  

the following table sets forth principal cash flows by scheduled maturity effective weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value of our debt obligations as of september 30 2012  the interest rate for our variable rate debt represents the interest rate on our mortgage repurchase facility because the mortgage repurchase facility is effectively secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale which are typically sold within 60 days its outstanding balance is included as a variable rate maturity in the most current period presented

for the past five years conditions in the homebuilding industry have been challenging during this time we have reduced our sga cost structure rebid the costs in our homes redesigned our product to be more efficient to build reduced our homes under construction to more closely match current demand and enforced very conservative land and lot inventory investment guidelines we have generated significant cash from operations by reducing our land inventory our homes under construction and our mortgage loans held for sale and from income tax refunds we used this cash to reduce our outstanding notes payable and to increase our cash balances as a result of all of these actions we have a strong liquidity position and have improved our balance sheet leverage both on a gross and net basis from the beginning of the housing downturn we will continue to conservatively manage our business and our liquidity and balance sheet strength provide us with flexibility in determining the appropriate operating strategy for each of our communities and markets to strike the best balance between cash flow generation and potential profit 

 

geographic diversity 

 

from inception to 1987 our homebuilding activities were conducted in the dallasfort worth area we then diversified geographically by entering additional markets both through startup operations and acquisitions we now operate in 25 states and 73 markets this provides us with geographic diversification in our homebuilding inventory investments and our sources of revenues and earnings we believe our diversification strategy helps to mitigate the effects of local and regional economic cycles and enhances our longterm potential 

 

economies of scale 

 

we are the largest homebuilding company in the united states in terms of number of homes closed in fiscal 2011 by the same measure we are also one of the five largest builders in many of our markets in fiscal 2011 we believe that our national regional and local scale of operations has provided us with benefits that may not be available in the same degree to some other smaller homebuilders such as

decentralized operations 

 

we decentralize our homebuilding activities to give operating flexibility to our local division presidents on certain key operating decisions at september 30 2011 we had 29 separate homebuilding operating divisions many of which operate in more than one market area generally each operating division consists of a division president land entitlement acquisition and development personnel a sales manager and sales personnel a construction manager and construction superintendents customer service personnel a controller a purchasing manager and office staff we believe that division presidents and their management teams who are familiar with local conditions generally have better information on which to base decisions regarding their operations our division presidents receive performance bonuses based upon achieving targeted financial and operational measures related to their operating divisions 

 

operating division responsibilities 

 

each operating division is responsible for 

 

  

— a feasibility study 

 

— soil and environmental reviews 

 

— review of existing zoning and other governmental requirements and 

 

— review of the need for and extent of offsite work required to meet local building codes 

 

  

centralized controls 

 

we centralize the key risk elements of our homebuilding business through our regional and corporate offices we have four separate homebuilding regional offices generally each regional office consists of a region president legal counsel a chief financial officer a purchasing manager and limited office support staff each of our region presidents and their management teams are responsible for oversight of the operations of certain homebuilding operating divisions including 

 

  

our corporate executives and corporate office departments are responsible for establishing our operational policies and internal control standards and for monitoring compliance with established policies and controls 

throughout our operations the corporate office also has primary responsibility for direct management of certain key risk elements and initiatives through the following centralized functions 

 

  

cost management 

 

we control overhead costs by centralizing certain administrative and accounting functions and by closely monitoring the number of administrative personnel and management positions in our operating divisions as well as in our regional and corporate offices we also seek to efficiently manage our advertising costs by directing many of our promotional activities toward local real estate brokers 

 

we control construction costs by striving to design our homes efficiently and by obtaining competitive bids for construction materials and labor we also seek to negotiate favorable pricing from our primary subcontractors and suppliers based on the volume of services and products we purchase from them on a local regional and national basis we monitor our construction costs on each house as well as our inventory levels margins expenses and profitability through our management information systems 

 

acquisitions 

 

we are committed to maintaining our strong balance sheet and liquidity position however we will continue to evaluate opportunities for strategic acquisitions or expansions of our operations we believe that the current housing industry downturn may provide us selected opportunities to enhance our operations through the acquisition of existing homebuilding companies or distressed real estate properties at attractive valuations in certain instances such acquisitions can provide us benefits not found in startup operations such as established land positions and inventories and existing relationships with municipalities land owners developers subcontractors and suppliers we seek to limit the risks associated with acquiring other companies and distressed real estate properties by conducting extensive operational financial and legal due diligence on each acquisition and by performing financial analysis to determine that each acquisition will have a positive impact on our earnings within an acceptable period of time 

markets 

 

we conduct our homebuilding operations in the geographic regions states and markets listed below and we conduct our mortgage and title operations in many of these markets our homebuilding operating divisions are aggregated into six reporting segments also referred to as reporting regions which comprise the markets below our financial statements contain additional information regarding segment performance 

 

 

 

when evaluating new or existing homebuilding markets for purposes of capital allocation we consider local marketspecific factors including among others 

 

  

land policies 

 

we acquire land after we have completed due diligence and generally after we have obtained the rights known as entitlements to begin development or construction work resulting in an acceptable number of residential lots before we acquire lots or tracts of land we will among other things complete a feasibility study which includes soil tests independent environmental studies and other engineering work and evaluate the status of necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements required to develop and use the property for home construction although we purchase and develop land primarily to support our homebuilding activities we also sell land and lots to other developers and homebuilders where we have excess land and lot positions 

 

we also enter into landlot option contracts in which we obtain the right but generally not the obligation to buy land or lots at predetermined prices on a defined schedule commensurate with anticipated home closings or planned development our option contracts generally are nonrecourse which limits our financial exposure to our earnest money deposited with land and lot sellers and any preacquisition due diligence costs incurred by us this enables us to control land and lot positions with limited capital investment which substantially reduces the risks associated with land ownership and development 

 

almost all of our land and lot positions are acquired directly by us we have avoided entering into joint venture arrangements due to their increased costs and complexity as well as the loss of operational control inherent in such arrangements we are a party to a very small number of joint ventures that were acquired through acquisitions of other homebuilders all of these joint ventures are consolidated in our financial statements 

 

we attempt to mitigate our exposure to real estate inventory risks by

construction 

 

our home designs are selected or prepared in each of our markets to appeal to local tastes and preferences of homebuyers in each community we also offer optional interior and exterior features to allow homebuyers to enhance the basic home design and to allow us to generate additional revenues from each home sold we continually adjust our product offerings to address our customers’ expectations for affordability home size and features 

 

substantially all of our construction work is performed by subcontractors subcontractors typically are selected after a competitive bidding process and retained for a specific subdivision pursuant to a contract that obligates the subcontractor to complete construction at an agreedupon price agreements with the subcontractors and suppliers we use generally are negotiated for each subdivision we compete with other homebuilders for qualified subcontractors raw materials and lots in the markets where we operate we employ construction superintendents to monitor homes under construction participate in major design and building decisions coordinate the activities of subcontractors and suppliers review the work of subcontractors for quality and cost controls and monitor compliance with zoning and building codes in addition our construction superintendents play a significant role in working with our homebuyers by assisting with option selection and home modification decisions educating buyers on the construction process and instructing buyers on postclosing home maintenance 

 

construction time for our homes depends on the weather availability of labor materials and supplies size of the home and other factors we typically complete the construction of a home within three to six months 

 

we typically do not maintain significant inventories of construction materials except for work in progress materials for homes under construction generally the construction materials used in our operations are readily available from numerous sources we have contracts exceeding one year with certain suppliers of our building materials that are cancelable at our option with a 30 day notice in recent years we have not experienced delays in construction due to shortages of materials or labor that have materially affected our consolidated operating results 

 

marketing and sales 

 

we market and sell our homes through commissioned employees and independent real estate brokers we typically conduct home sales from sales offices located in furnished model homes in each subdivision and we typically do not offer our model homes for sale until the completion of a subdivision our sales personnel assist prospective homebuyers by providing them with floor plans price information tours of model homes and assisting them with the selection of options and other custom features we train and inform our sales personnel as to the availability of financing construction schedules and marketing and advertising plans as our customers are typically firsttime or moveup homebuyers we attempt to adjust our product mix and pricing within our homebuilding markets to keep our homes affordable as market conditions warrant we may provide potential homebuyers with one or more of a variety of incentives including discounts and free upgrades to be competitive in a particular market 

 

we market our homes and communities to prospective homebuyers and real estate brokers in our local markets through electronic media including email social networking sites and our company internet website as well as brochures flyers newsletters and promotional events we also use billboards radio television and newspaper advertising as necessary in each local market to minimize advertising costs we attempt to operate in subdivisions in conspicuous locations that permit us to take advantage of local traffic patterns we believe 

that model homes play a substantial role in our marketing efforts and therefore expend significant effort to create an attractive atmosphere in our model homes 

 

we also build a limited number of speculative homes in most of our subdivisions these homes enhance our marketing and sales efforts to prospective homebuyers who are relocating to these markets as well as to independent brokers who often represent homebuyers requiring a completed home within a short time frame we determine our speculative homes strategy in each market based on local market factors such as new job growth the number of job relocations housing demand and supply seasonality current sales contract cancellation trends and our past experience in the market we expect to maintain a level of speculative home inventory in our markets based on our current and planned sales pace and we monitor and adjust speculative home inventory on an ongoing basis as conditions warrant speculative homes help to provide us with opportunities to sell additional homes at a profit and generate positive returns and cash flows on our inventory of owned lots 

 

our sales contracts require an earnest money deposit which varies in amount among our markets and subdivisions additionally customers are generally required to pay additional deposits when they select options or upgrade features for their homes most of our sales contracts stipulate that when customers cancel their contracts with us we have the right to retain their earnest money and option deposits however our operating divisions occasionally choose to refund the deposit our sales contracts also include a financing contingency which permits customers to cancel and receive a refund of their deposit if they cannot obtain mortgage financing at prevailing or specified interest rates within a specified period our contracts may include other contingencies such as the sale of an existing home as a percentage of gross sales orders cancellations of sales contracts in fiscal 2011 were 27 compared to 26 in fiscal 2010 the length of time between the signing of a sales contract for a home and delivery of the home to the buyer closing is generally from two to six months 

 

customer service and quality control 

 

our operating divisions are responsible for preclosing quality control inspections and responding to customers’ postclosing needs we believe that a prompt and courteous response to homebuyers’ needs during and after construction reduces postclosing repair costs enhances our reputation for quality and service and ultimately leads to significant repeat and referral business from the real estate community and homebuyers we typically provide our homebuyers with a tenyear limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems a twoyear limited warranty on major mechanical systems and a oneyear limited warranty on other construction components the subcontractors who perform the actual construction also provide us with warranties on workmanship and are generally prepared to respond to us and the homeowner promptly upon request in addition some of our suppliers provide manufacturer’s warranties on specified products installed in the home 

 

sales order backlog 

 

at september 30 2011 the value of our backlog of sales orders was 10362 million 4854 homes an increase of 22 from 8508 million 4128 homes at september 30 2010 the average sales price of homes in backlog was 213500 at september 30 2011 up 4 from the 206100 average at september 30 2010 sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies including mortgage loan approval and buyers selling their existing homes which can result in cancellations a portion of the contracts in backlog will not result in closings due to cancellations substantially all of the homes in our sales backlog at september 30 2011 are scheduled to close in fiscal year 2012 further discussion of our backlog is provided in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

customer mortgage financing 

 

we provide mortgage financing services principally to purchasers of our homes in the majority of our homebuilding markets through our whollyowned subsidiary dhi mortgage dhi mortgage coordinates and expedites the sales transaction by ensuring that mortgage commitments are received and that closings take place in a timely and efficient manner dhi mortgage originates mortgage loans for a substantial portion of our homebuyers during the year ended september 30 2011 approximately 85 of dhi mortgage’s loan volume related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations and dhi mortgage provided mortgage financing services for approximately 61 of our total homes closed 

 

to limit the risks associated with our mortgage operations dhi mortgage originates loan products that we believe can be sold to thirdparty purchasers dhi mortgage generally sells the loans and their servicing rights to thirdparty purchasers shortly after origination with limited recourse provisions in markets where we currently do not provide mortgage financing we work with a variety of mortgage lenders that make available to homebuyers a range of mortgage financing programs 

 

title services 

 

through our subsidiary title companies we serve as a title insurance agent in selected markets by providing title insurance policies examination and closing services primarily to the purchasers of homes we build and sell we currently assume little or no underwriting risk associated with these title policies 

 

employees 

 

at september 30 2011 we employed 3010 persons of whom 804 were sales and marketing personnel 959 were executive administrative and clerical personnel 619 were involved in construction and 628 worked in mortgage and title operations we believe that our relations with our employees are good 

 

competition 

 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous other national regional and local homebuilders for homebuyers desirable properties raw materials skilled labor employees management talent and financing we also compete with resales of existing homes and with the rental housing market our homes compete on the basis of quality price design mortgage financing terms and location our competition remains intense with other homebuilders especially as to pricing and incentives additionally the large number of foreclosed homes being offered for sale creates competition for homebuyers and negatively affects pricing our financial services business competes with other mortgage lenders including national regional and local mortgage bankers and other financial institutions many of which have greater access to capital different lending criteria and potentially broader product offerings 

 

governmental regulation and environmental matters 

 

the homebuilding industry is subject to extensive and complex regulations we and the subcontractors we use must comply with various federal state and local laws and regulations including zoning density and development requirements building environmental advertising labor and real estate sales rules and regulations these regulations and requirements affect the development process as well as building materials to be used building designs and minimum elevation of properties our homes are inspected by local authorities where required and homes eligible for insurance or guarantees provided by the federal housing administration fha and the veterans administration va are subject to inspection by them these regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities in addition our new housing developments may be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets and other public improvements 

 

our homebuilding operations are also subject to a variety of local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning protection of health safety and the environment the particular environmental laws for each site vary greatly according to location environmental condition and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties 

our mortgage company and title insurance agencies must comply with various federal and state laws and regulations these include eligibility and other requirements for participation in the programs offered by the fha va government national mortgage association ginnie mae federal national mortgage association fannie mae and federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac these also include required compliance with consumer lending and other laws and regulations such as disclosure requirements prohibitions against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures these laws and regulations subject our operations to examination by the applicable agencies 

 

seasonality 

 

we have typically experienced seasonal variations in our quarterly operating results and capital requirements prior to the current downturn in the homebuilding industry which began to affect our seasonal patterns in fiscal 2007 we generally had more homes under construction closed more homes and had greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year this seasonal activity increased our working capital requirements for our homebuilding operations during the third and fourth fiscal quarters and increased our funding requirements for the mortgages we originated in our financial services segment at the end of these quarters as a result of seasonal activity our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year 

 

although the weakness in homebuilding market conditions mitigated our historical seasonal variations in recent years our home closings and income before income taxes were higher in the second half of fiscal 2011 than in the first half of the year however given the current uncertain outlook for market conditions we can make no assurances as to whether this pattern will continue beyond the current fiscal year

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

discussion of our business and operations included in this annual report on form 10k should be read together with the risk factors set forth below they describe various risks and uncertainties we are or may become subject to many of which are difficult to predict or beyond our control these risks and uncertainties together with other factors described elsewhere in this report have the potential to affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner 

 

the homebuilding industry is undergoing a significant downturn and its duration and ultimate severity are uncertain continued weakness or further deterioration in industry conditions or in the broader economic conditions could have additional adverse effects on our business and financial results 

 

the downturn in the homebuilding industry is in its fifth year and it has become one of the most severe housing downturns in us history the significant declines in the demand for new homes oversupply of homes on the market and reductions in the availability of financing for homebuyers that have marked the downturn are continuing during the downturn we have experienced material reductions in our home sales and homebuilding revenues and we have incurred material asset impairments and writeoffs 

 

our ability to respond to the downturn has been limited by adverse industry and economic conditions the significant number of home mortgage foreclosures has increased supply and driven down prices making the purchase of a foreclosed home an alternative to purchasing a new home as well as negatively affecting appraisal comparisons for mortgage financing homebuilders have responded to declining sales and increased cancellation rates with significant concessions with the decline in the values of homes and the inability of some homeowners to make their mortgage payments the credit markets have been significantly disrupted putting strains on many households and businesses in the face of these conditions the overall economy has remained very weak with high unemployment levels and substantially reduced consumer spending and confidence as a result demand for new homes remains at historically low levels 

 

these challenging conditions are complex and interrelated we cannot predict their duration or ultimate severity nor can we provide assurance that our responses to the homebuilding downturn or the government’s attempts to address the troubles in the overall economy will be successful 

constriction of the credit markets could limit our ability to access capital and increase our costs of capital 

 

during the downturn in the homebuilding industry we generated substantial operating cash flow and we have relied principally on our cash on hand to meet our working capital needs and repay outstanding indebtedness the downturn and the constriction of the credit markets have reduced some of the other sources of liquidity available to us there likely will be periods when financial market upheaval will limit our ability to access the public debt markets or obtain bank financing or doing so will increase our cost of capital 

 

our mortgage subsidiary dhi mortgage uses a mortgage repurchase facility to finance many of the loans it originates the facility must be renewed annually and the current facility expires in march 2012 a continuation of current market conditions could make the renewal more difficult or could result in an increase in the cost of the facility or a decrease in its committed availability such conditions may also make it more difficult or costly to sell the mortgages that we originate 

 

we believe we can meet our capital requirements in the next 12 months with our existing cash resources however we can provide no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so particularly if current industry or economic conditions continue or deteriorate further the future effects on our business liquidity and financial results of these conditions could be material and adverse both in ways described above and in other ways that we do not currently foresee 

 

we use letters of credit and surety bonds to secure our performance under various construction and land development agreements escrow agreements financial guarantees and other arrangements should our future performance or economic conditions make these more difficult to obtain or more costly our business or financial results could be adversely affected 

 

the reduction in availability of mortgage financing has adversely affected our business and the duration and ultimate severity of the effects are uncertain 

 

over the last five fiscal years the mortgage lending industry has experienced significant change and contraction credit requirements have tightened and investor demand for mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities has been limited to securities backed by fannie mae freddie mac or ginnie mae this has made it more difficult for many buyers to finance the purchase of our homes thus reducing the pool of qualified homebuyers these reductions in demand have adversely affected our business and financial results and the duration and severity of these effects remain uncertain 

 

we believe that the liquidity provided by fannie mae freddie mac and ginnie mae to the mortgage industry has been very important to the housing market fannie mae and freddie mac have required substantial injections of capital from the federal government and may require additional government support in the future in addition increased lending volume and losses insured by the fha have resulted in a reduction of its insurance fund any reduction in the availability of the financing provided by these institutions could adversely affect interest rates mortgage availability and sales of new homes and mortgage loans 

 

the fha insures mortgage loans that generally have lower credit requirements and as a result continue to be a particularly important source for financing the sale of our homes in the last three years more restrictive guidelines have been placed on fha insured loans affecting minimum down payment and availability for condominium financing in the near future further restrictions are expected on fha insured loans including but not limited to additional limitations on sellerpaid closing costs and concessions this or any other restriction may negatively affect the availability or affordability of fha financing which could adversely affect our ability to sell homes 

 

while the use of down payment assistance programs by our homebuyers has decreased significantly some of our customers still utilize 100 financing through programs offered by the va and united states department of agriculture usda there can be no assurance that these programs or other programs will continue to be available or will be as attractive to our customers as the programs currently offered which could negatively affect our sales 

the mortgage loans originated by our financial services operation are sold to thirdparty purchasers an entity which has historically purchased a substantial volume of mortgage loans from us has recently announced that they are exiting this line of business if we are unable to sell to additional viable purchasers in the marketplace our ability to originate and sell mortgage loans at competitive prices could be limited which would negatively affect our profitability 

 

even if potential customers do not need financing changes in the availability of mortgage products may make it more difficult for them to sell their current homes to potential buyers who need financing 

 

mortgage rates are currently at historically low levels if interest rates increase the costs of owning a home will be affected and could result in further reductions in the demand for our homes 

 

our strategies in responding to the adverse conditions in the homebuilding industry have had limited success and the continued implementation of these and other strategies may not be successful 

 

we have been successful in increasing our liquidity by generating positive operating cash flow and reducing our leverage during the downturn however during this time notwithstanding our sales strategies we continued to experience a low level of sales demand and an elevated rate of sales contract cancellations we believe this is largely due to reduced homebuyer confidence due principally to the weak economy and the continuing high level of unemployment a more restrictive mortgage lending environment and the inability of some buyers to sell their existing homes have also impacted our sales orders many of these factors which affect new sales and cancellation rates are beyond our control it is uncertain how long the low sales level and elevated level of cancellations will continue if these conditions continue for a protracted period it is not clear whether our strategies will succeed in maintaining or increasing our sales volume or our current margins 

 

our business and financial results could be adversely affected by significant inflation or deflation 

 

inflation can adversely affect us by increasing costs of land materials and labor in the event of a return of significant inflation we may seek to increase the sales prices of homes in order to maintain satisfactory margins however a continuation of the oversupply of homes relative to demand may make this difficult in addition significant inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates which have a negative impact on housing demand in such an environment we may not be able to raise home prices sufficiently to keep up with the rate of inflation and our margins could decrease moreover with inflation the costs of capital increase and the purchasing power of our cash resources can decline current or future efforts by the government to stimulate the economy may increase the risk of significant inflation and its adverse impact on our business or financial results 

 

alternatively a significant period of deflation could cause a decrease in overall spending and borrowing levels this could lead to a further deterioration in economic conditions including an increase in the rate of unemployment deflation could also cause the value of our inventories to decline or reduce the value of existing homes below the related mortgage loan balance which could potentially increase the supply of existing homes and have a negative impact on our results of operations 

 

the homebuilding industry is cyclical and affected by changes in general economic real estate or other business conditions that could adversely affect our business or financial results 

 

the homebuilding industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in industry conditions as well as changes in general and local economic conditions such as 

 

 12 

 

  

these may occur on a national scale like the current downturn or may affect some of our regions or markets more than others when adverse conditions affect any of our larger markets they could have a proportionately greater impact on us than on some other homebuilding companies our operations in previously strong markets particularly california florida nevada and arizona have more adversely affected our financial results than our other markets in the current downturn 

 

an oversupply of alternatives to new homes including foreclosed homes homes held for sale by investors and speculators other existing homes and rental properties can also reduce our ability to sell new homes depress new home prices and reduce our margins on the sales of new homes high levels of foreclosures not only contribute to additional inventory available for sale but also reduce appraisal valuations for new homes and the amount that can be financed potentially resulting in lower sales prices 

 

weather conditions and natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes wildfires volcanic activity droughts and floods can harm our homebuilding business these can delay home closings adversely affect the cost or availability of materials or labor or damage homes under construction the climates and geology of many of the states in which we operate including california florida and texas where we have some of our larger operations present increased risks of adverse weather or natural disasters 

 

continued military deployments to foreign regions terrorist attacks other acts of violence or threats to national security and any corresponding response by the united states or others or related domestic or international instability may adversely affect general economic conditions or cause a slowdown of the economy 

 

as a result of the foregoing matters potential customers may be less willing or able to buy our homes because of weak industry and economic conditions we have generally not been able to increase the sale prices of our homes in recent years in the future our pricing strategies may also be limited by market conditions we may be unable to further change the mix of our home offerings reduce the costs of the homes we build or offer more affordable homes to maintain our margins or satisfactorily address changing market conditions in other ways in addition cancellations of home sales contracts in backlog may increase as homebuyers choose to not honor their contracts due to any of the factors discussed above 

 

our financial services business is closely related to our homebuilding business as it originates mortgage loans principally to purchasers of the homes we build a decrease in the demand for our homes because of the foregoing matters may also adversely affect the financial results of this segment of our business an increase in the default rate on the mortgages we originate may adversely affect our ability to sell the mortgages or the pricing we receive upon the sale of mortgages or may increase our repurchase or other obligations for previous originations we establish reserves related to mortgages we have sold however actual future obligations related to these mortgages could differ significantly from our currently estimated amounts 

 

the risks associated with our land and lot inventory could adversely affect our business or financial results 

 

inventory risks are substantial for our homebuilding business the risks inherent in controlling or purchasing and developing land increase as consumer demand for housing decreases thus we may have acquired options on or bought and developed land or lots at a cost we will not be able to recover fully or on which we cannot build and sell homes profitably as a result our deposits for building lots controlled under option or similar contracts may be put at risk the value of our owned undeveloped land building lots and housing inventories can also fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions in addition inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in reduced margins or losses in a poorly performing community or market during the current economic downturn we have sold homes and land for lower margins or at a loss and we have recorded significant inventory impairment charges 

 

our levels of owned and controlled land and building lots are based on management’s expectations for future volume growth in light of the much weaker market conditions encountered since fiscal 2006 we have 

significantly slowed our purchases of undeveloped land and our development spending on land we own we made substantial land and lot sales in fiscal 2008 throughout the downturn we also terminated numerous land option contracts and wrote off earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs related to these option contracts because future market conditions are uncertain we cannot provide assurance that these measures will be successful in managing our future inventory risks 

 

supply shortages and other risks related to demand for building materials and skilled labor could increase our costs and delay deliveries 

 

the homebuilding industry has from time to time experienced significant difficulties that can affect the cost or timing of construction including 

 

  

these factors may cause us to take longer or incur more costs to build our homes and adversely affect our revenues and margins 

 

increases in the costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business or financial results 

 

significant expenses of owning a home including mortgage interest and real estate taxes generally are deductible expenses for an individual’s federal and in some cases state income taxes subject to various limitations under current tax law and policy if the federal government or a state government changes its income tax laws as has been discussed from time to time to eliminate or substantially modify these income tax deductions the aftertax cost of owning a new home would increase for many of our potential customers the loss or reduction of homeowner tax deductions if such tax law changes were enacted without offsetting provisions would adversely impact demand for and sales prices of new homes 

 

in addition increases in property tax rates by local governmental authorities as experienced in response to reduced federal and state funding can adversely affect the ability of potential customers to obtain financing or their desire to purchase new homes 

 

governmental regulations could increase the cost and limit the availability of our development and homebuilding projects and adversely affect our business or financial results 

 

we are subject to extensive and complex regulations that affect land development and home construction including zoning density restrictions building design and building standards these regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities as to the conditions we must meet prior to development or construction being approved if approved at all we are subject to determinations by these authorities as to the adequacy of water or sewage facilities roads or other local services new housing developments may also be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets and other public improvements in addition in many markets government authorities have implemented no growth or growth control initiatives any of these can limit delay or increase the costs of development or home construction 

 

we are also subject to a variety of local state and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of health safety and the environment the impact of environmental laws varies depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available these matters may result in delays may cause us to incur 

substantial compliance remediation mitigation and other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas 

 

governmental regulation of our financial services operations could adversely affect our business or financial results 

 

our financial services operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations these include eligibility requirements for participation in federal loan programs compliance with consumer lending and similar requirements such as disclosure requirements prohibitions against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures they may also subject our operations to examination by the applicable agencies these factors may limit our ability to provide mortgage financing or title services to potential purchasers of our homes 

 

in july 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act hr4173 was signed into law this legislation provides for a number of new requirements relating to residential mortgage lending practices many of which are to be developed further by implementing rules these include among others minimum standards for mortgages and lender practices in making mortgages limitations on certain fees and incentive arrangements retention of credit risk and remedies for borrowers in foreclosure proceedings the effect of such provisions on our financial services business will depend on the rules that are ultimately enacted key decisions that have yet to be made concern the characteristics of mortgages that would be exempt from risk retention how risk retention requirements will be implemented and how derivative trading will be impacted these factors could restrict the availability of and increase the cost of mortgage credit in addition to increasing the general and administrative costs within our financial services operations 

 

the turmoil caused by the increasing number of defaults and resulting foreclosures has encouraged consumer lawsuits and the investigation of financial services industry practices by governmental authorities these investigations could include the examination of consumer lending practices sales of mortgages to financial institutions and other investors and current foreclosure processes or other practices in the financial services segments of homebuilding companies we are unable to assess whether these governmental inquiries will result in changes in regulations homebuilding industry practices or adversely affect the costs and potential profitability of homebuilding companies 

 

homebuilding is subject to home warranty and construction defect claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant 

 

as a homebuilder we are subject to home warranty and construction defect claims arising in the ordinary course of business as a consequence we maintain product liability insurance and we obtain indemnities and certificates of insurance from subcontractors covering claims related to their workmanship and materials we establish warranty and other reserves for the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built because of the uncertainties inherent to these matters we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will be adequate to address all of our warranty and construction defect claims in the future contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce we may be responsible for applicable selfinsured retentions and some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits additionally the coverage offered by and the availability of product liability insurance for construction defects is currently limited and costly we have responded to increases in insurance costs and coverage limitations in recent years by increasing our selfinsured retentions and claim reserves there can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted or become more costly 

 

our debt obligations could adversely affect our financial condition 

 

as of september 30 2011 our consolidated debt was 17046 million as of september 30 2011 other than the expiration of the mortgage repurchase facility in march 2012 there are no scheduled maturities of principal on our outstanding public debt during the next 12 months the indentures governing our senior and convertible senior notes do not restrict the incurrence of future unsecured debt and they permit significant 

amounts of secured debt we do not currently have a revolving credit facility for our homebuilding operations if we choose to enter into a new line of credit agreement it may limit the amount of debt we could incur 

 

possible consequences the amount and the maturities of our debt could have important consequences for example they could 

 

  

in addition the magnitude of our debt and the restrictions imposed by the instruments governing these obligations expose us to additional risks including 

 

dependence on future performance our ability to meet our debt service and other obligations will depend in part upon our future financial performance our future results are subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report these have been compounded by the current industry and economic conditions our revenues and earnings vary with the level of general economic activity in the markets we serve our businesses are also affected by financial political business and other factors many of which are beyond our control the factors that affect our ability to generate cash can also affect our ability to raise additional funds for these purposes through the sale of debt or equity the refinancing of debt or the sale of assets 

 

mortgage repurchase facility and other restrictions the mortgage repurchase facility for our mortgage subsidiary requires the maintenance of a minimum level of tangible net worth a maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and a minimum level of liquidity by our mortgage subsidiary a failure to comply with these requirements could allow the lending bank to terminate the availability of funds to the financial services subsidiaries or cause their debt to become due and payable prior to maturity any difficulty experienced in complying with these covenants could make the renewal of the facility more difficult or costly 

 

in addition although our financial services business is conducted through subsidiaries that are not restricted by our indentures the ability of our financial services subsidiaries to provide funds to our homebuilding operations is subject to restrictions in their mortgage repurchase facility these funds would not be available to us upon the occurrence and during the continuance of defaults under this facility moreover our right to receive assets from these subsidiaries upon their liquidation or recapitalization will be subject to the prior claims of the creditors of these subsidiaries any claims we may have to funds from this segment would be subordinate to subsidiary indebtedness to the extent of any security for such indebtedness and to any indebtedness otherwise recognized as senior to our claims 

 

the indentures governing our senior notes impose restrictions on the creation of secured debt and liens 

 

changes in debt ratings our senior unsecured debt is currently rated at below investment grade any lowering of our debt ratings could make entering into a new line of credit agreement or accessing the public capital markets more difficult andor more expensive 

 

change of control purchase options if a change of control occurs as defined in the indentures governing 4555 million principal amount of our senior notes as of september 30 2011 we would be required to offer to purchase these notes at 101 of their principal amount together with all accrued and unpaid interest if any if a fundamental change including a change of control occurs as defined in the indenture governing our convertible senior notes which constituted 500 million principal amount as of september 30 2011 we would be required to offer to purchase these notes at par together with all accrued 

and unpaid interest if any if purchase offers were required under the indentures for these notes we can give no assurance that we would have sufficient funds to pay the amounts that we would be required to purchase 

 

potential future restrictions we do not currently have a revolving line of credit in place however if we decide to enter into a revolving credit agreement in the future it is likely that we would become subject to further restrictions on our operations and activities 

 

homebuilding and financial services are very competitive industries and competitive conditions could adversely affect our business or financial results 

 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive homebuilders compete not only for homebuyers but also for desirable properties financing raw materials and skilled labor we compete with other local regional and national homebuilders often within larger subdivisions designed planned and developed by such homebuilders we also compete with existing home sales foreclosures and rental properties the competitive conditions in the homebuilding industry can negatively impact our sales volumes selling prices and incentive levels reduce our profit margins and cause impairments in the value of our inventory or other assets competition can also hurt our ability to acquire suitable land raw materials and skilled labor at acceptable prices or terms or cause delays in the construction of our homes 

 

our financial services business competes with other mortgage lenders including national regional and local mortgage banks and other financial institutions mortgage lenders with greater access to capital or different lending criteria may be able to offer more attractive financing to potential customers 

 

our homebuilding and financial services businesses compete with other companies both from within and outside of these industries to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced employees managers and executives competition for the services of these individuals will likely increase substantially as business conditions begin to stabilize or improve in the homebuilding and financial services industries or in the general economy if we are unable to attract and retain key employees managers or executives our business could be adversely impacted 

 

we cannot make any assurances that any future growth strategies will be successful or not expose us to additional risks 

 

although we have focused on internal growth in recent years we may in the future make strategic acquisitions of homebuilding companies or their assets successful strategic acquisitions require the integration of operations and management although we believe that we have been successful in the past we can give no assurance that we would be able to successfully identify acquire and integrate strategic acquisitions in the future acquisitions can result in the dilution of existing stockholders if we issue our common stock as consideration or reduce our liquidity or increase our debt if we fund them with cash the impact on liquidity may be increased because we do not currently have a revolving credit facility in addition acquisitions can expose us to valuation risks including the risk of writing off goodwill or impairing inventory and other assets related to such acquisitions the risk of goodwill and other asset impairments increases during a cyclical housing downturn when our profitability may decline as evidenced by the goodwill and other asset impairment charges we recognized in recent years in addition we may not be able to successfully implement our operating or internal growth strategies within our existing markets in the uncertain current market conditions asset acquisitions involve a risk that the markets involved may subsequently deteriorate conversely if we delay an acquisition until we believe the market uncertainties are resolved the potential competitive advantages of the acquisition may be limited 

 

we may not realize our deferred income tax asset 

 

as of september 30 2011 we have a net deferred income tax asset of 8485 million against which we have provided a valuation allowance of 8485 million the realization of all or a portion of our deferred income tax asset is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the statutory carryforward periods and in the jurisdictions in which the related temporary differences become deductible 

the accounting for deferred income taxes is based upon estimates of future results differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position changes in tax laws also affect actual tax results and the valuation of deferred income tax assets over time 

 

the utilization of our tax losses could be substantially limited if we experienced an ownership change as defined in the internal revenue code 

 

we have experienced continuing tax net operating losses through fiscal 2011 and have potential unrealized builtin losses these tax net operating losses have the potential to reduce future income tax obligations if we realize taxable income in the future however section 382 of the internal revenue code contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards and certain builtin losses recognized in years after the ownership change under the rules such an ownership change is generally any change in ownership of more than 50 of its stock within a rolling threeyear period as calculated in accordance with the rules the rules generally operate by focusing on changes in ownership among stockholders considered by the rules as owning directly or indirectly 5 or more of the stock of the company and any change in ownership arising from new issuances of stock by the company 

 

if we undergo an ownership change for purposes of section 382 as a result of future transactions involving our common stock both the amount of and our ability to use any of our net operating loss carryforwards tax credit carryforwards or net unrealized builtin losses at the time of ownership change would be subject to the limitations of section 382 in addition these limitations may affect the expiration date of a portion of our builtin losses any net operating loss carryforwards or tax credit carryforwards and we may not be able to use them before they expire this could adversely affect our financial position results of operations and cash flow 

 

we do not believe we have experienced such an ownership change as of september 30 2011 however the amount by which our ownership may change in the future is affected by purchases and sales of stock by 5 stockholders the potential conversion of our outstanding convertible senior notes and our decision as to whether to settle any such conversions completely or partially in stock and new issuances of stock by us

results of operations — fiscal year 2011 overview 

 

in fiscal 2011 conditions within the homebuilding industry remained challenging although the overall level of new home demand declined from the prior year as a result of the expiration of the federal homebuyer tax credit in april 2010 we saw some improvement in our net sales orders during the last half of fiscal 2011 compared to the last half of fiscal 2010 the number and value of our net sales orders were 2 and 8 higher respectively during the last six months of fiscal 2011 than in the comparable period of fiscal 2010 and were 7 and 13 higher respectively in the last three months of fiscal 2011 than in the comparable period of fiscal 2010 in addition during fiscal 2011 we experienced a more traditional demand pattern in our net sales orders which sequentially increased from the first quarter to the second quarter remained at a consistent level in the third quarter then slowed in our fourth quarter these results suggest that overall demand for new homes may be stabilizing but we expect that demand is likely to remain at low levels for some time 

 

our level of home closings in fiscal 2011 was essentially the same level that we achieved in fiscal 2009 however our pretax income increased from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2011 by 569 million while 397 million of the increase was due to reductions in inventory impairments and land option cost writeoffs and mortgage recourse and reinsurance expenses recognized in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2009 the remaining increase of 172 million reflects the results of our strategies to open new communities improve gross margins adjust our sga costs to current revenue levels and reduce our outstanding debt levels and related interest expense 

 

despite the continued low level of demand for new homes and the weak homebuilding industry conditions our strong balance sheet and liquidity position is allowing us to invest in market opportunities as they arise we believe we are wellpositioned for an eventual housing recovery we will continue to adjust our business strategies as necessary based on housing demand in each of our markets our future results could be negatively impacted by prolonged weakness in the economy continued high levels of unemployment a significant increase in mortgage interest rates or further tightening of mortgage lending standards 

 

we have evaluated our homebuilding and financial services assets for recoverability our assets whose recoverability is most impacted by market conditions include inventory earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs related to land and lot option contracts tax assets and owned mortgage loans these assets collectively represented approximately 90 of our total assets excluding cash and marketable securities at september 30 2011 our evaluations incorporated our expectation of continued challenges in the homebuilding industry based on our evaluations during fiscal 2011 we recorded inventory impairment charges of 373 million wroteoff earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs related to land and lot option contracts we no longer plan to pursue of 81 million net of recoveries incurred charges of 116 million associated with mortgage loans held in portfolio and the limited recourse provisions on previously sold mortgage loans and incurred charges of 18 million related to mortgage reinsurance activities 

strategy 

 

it is difficult in the near term to predict if current homebuilding industry conditions will improve or if they will deteriorate during the industry downturn we generated significant cash flow from operations which we primarily used to increase our cash balances and reduce our outstanding debt our liquidity and reduced leverage provide us flexibility in determining the appropriate operating strategy for each of our communities and markets to strike the best balance between cash flow generation and potential profit our operating strategy continues to include the following initiatives 

 

  

although we cannot provide any assurances that these initiatives will be successful if market conditions do not deteriorate we expect that our operating strategy will allow us to continue to achieve profitability while maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity position in fiscal 2012 

key results 

 

key financial results as of and for our fiscal year ended september 30 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 were as follows 

 

homebuilding operations 

 

  

financial services operations 

 

  

consolidated results

results of operations — homebuilding 

 

our operating segments are our 29 homebuilding operating divisions which we aggregate into six reporting segments these reporting segments which we also refer to as reporting regions have homebuilding operations located in the following states 

 

 

 

fiscal year ended september 30 2011 compared to fiscal year ended september 30 2010 

 

the following tables and related discussion set forth key operating and financial data for our homebuilding operations by reporting segment as of and for the fiscal years ended september 30 2011 and 2010 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 26 

net sales orders 

 

the value of net sales orders decreased 7 to 37276 million 17421 homes in 2011 from 40110 million 19375 homes in 2010 the number of net sales orders decreased 10 in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 sales order volume during the first part of fiscal 2010 benefitted from the federal homebuyer tax credit during the last half of fiscal 2011 the number and value of our net sales orders were 2 and 8 higher respectively than in the last half of fiscal 2010 

 

in comparing fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2010 the value and volume of net sales orders decreased in most of our market regions with much of the volume decrease resulting from the expiration of the federal homebuyer tax credit the volume decline in our southwest region also reflected weaker market conditions in all of its markets combined with a reduction in the number of active communities in the current year our east and southeast regions experienced slight increases in net sales orders as a result of operating more communities in the current fiscal year fluctuations in the value of net sales orders were primarily due to the change in the number of homes sold in each respective region and to a lesser extent to small fluctuations in the average selling price of those homes our future sales volumes will depend on the strength of the overall economy employment levels and our ability to successfully implement our operating strategies in each of our markets 

 

the average price of our net sales orders in 2011 was 214000 an increase of 3 from the 207000 average in 2010 the largest percentage increases were in our southwest and west regions and were primarily due to opening new communities and adjusting our product mix with higher priced communities representing more of our sales we continue to adjust our product mix geographic mix and pricing within our homebuilding markets to respond to market conditions 

 

our annual sales order cancellation rate cancelled sales orders divided by gross sales orders for the period was 27 in fiscal 2011 compared to 26 in fiscal 2010 this cancellation rate continues to be above historical levels and is reflective of low consumer confidence and tight mortgage lending standards the return of our cancellation rate to historical levels depends largely on the strength of the overall economy and our ability to successfully implement our operating strategies in each of our markets 

 

 

 

sales order backlog 

 

sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies including mortgage loan approval and buyers selling their existing homes which can result in cancellations a portion of the contracts in backlog will not result in closings due to cancellations which have been substantial during the recent housing downturn 

 

our homes in backlog increased 18 at september 30 2011 from the prior year with significant increases in our east midwest and southeast regions the number of homes in backlog in these regions benefited from more active communities and improved third and fourth quarter sales as compared with the same periods of the prior year 

 

 

 

home sales revenue 

 

revenues from home sales decreased 18 to 35423 million 16695 homes closed in 2011 from 43023 million 20875 homes closed in 2010 the average selling price of homes closed during 2011 was 212200 up 3 from the 206100 average in 2010 which reflects a change in product mix rather than broad price appreciation during fiscal 2011 home sales revenues decreased in all of our market regions resulting from decreases in the number of homes closed 

 

the number of homes closed in fiscal 2011 decreased 20 due to decreases in all of our market regions the federal homebuyer tax credit helped stimulate demand for new homes during the prior year and following its expiration we experienced a significant decline in demand for our homes as reflected in our current year results as conditions change in the housing markets in which we operate our ongoing level of net sales orders will determine the number of home closings and amount of revenue we will generate 

homebuilding operating margin analysis 

 

 

 

home sales gross profit 

 

gross profit from home sales decreased by 23 to 5713 million in 2011 from 7440 million in 2010 and as a percentage of home sales revenues decreased 120 basis points to 161 the reduction in gross profit from home sales was primarily due to the increased levels of incentives and discounts needed to sell homes in the current year which narrowed the range between our selling prices and costs of our homes in most of our markets the prior year benefitted from the federal homebuyer tax credit which created demand for our homes without the need for us to provide as many incentives and discounts 

 

to the extent we utilize sales incentives and price adjustments to increase the level of home closings gross profit percentages will continue to be impacted 

 

land sales revenue 

 

land sales revenues decreased slightly to 73 million in 2011 from 74 million in 2010 fluctuations in revenues from land sales are a function of how we manage our inventory levels in various markets we generally purchase land and lots with the intent to build and sell homes on them however we occasionally purchase land that includes commercially zoned parcels which we typically sell to commercial developers and we also sell residential lots or land parcels to manage our land and lot supply land and lot sales occur at unpredictable intervals and varying degrees of profitability therefore the revenues and gross profit from land sales fluctuate from period to period as of september 30 2011 we had 263 million of land held for sale that we expect to sell in the next twelve months 

 

inventory impairments and land option cost writeoffs 

 

during fiscal 2011 when we performed our quarterly inventory impairment analyses by reviewing the performance and outlook for all of our communities the assumptions utilized reflected our expectation of continued challenging conditions and uncertainties in the homebuilding industry and in our markets as we continue to evaluate the strength of the economy measured largely in terms of job growth the level of underlying demand for new homes and our operating performance the level of impairments in future quarters will fluctuate and may increase as of september 30 2011 we evaluated communities with a combined carrying value of 3915 million for impairment the analysis of the majority of these communities assumed that sales prices in future periods will be equal to or lower than current sales order prices in each community or in comparable communities in order to generate an acceptable absorption rate for a minority of communities that we do not intend to develop or operate in current market conditions some increases over current sales prices were assumed while it is difficult to determine a timeframe for a given community in the current market conditions we estimated the remaining lives of these communities to range from six months to in excess of ten years in performing this analysis we utilized a range of discount rates for communities of 

12 to 18 through this evaluation process we determined that communities with a carrying value of 371 million as of september 30 2011 were impaired as a result during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 we recorded impairment charges of 102 million to reduce the carrying value of the impaired communities to their estimated fair value as compared to 291 million of impairment charges in the same period of 2010 the fourth quarter charges combined with impairment charges recorded earlier in the year resulted in total inventory impairment charges of 373 million and 623 million during fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively 

 

we generally perform our impairment analysis based on total inventory at the community level when an impairment charge for a community is determined the charge is then allocated to each lot in the community in the same manner as land and development costs are allocated to each lot the inventory within each community is categorized as construction in progress and finished homes residential land and lots developed and under development and land held for development based on the stage of production or plans for future development during fiscal 2011 approximately 78 of the impairment charges were recorded to residential land and lots and land held for development and approximately 22 of the charges were recorded to construction in progress and finished homes inventory compared to 93 and 7 respectively in fiscal 2010 

 

of the remaining 3544 million carrying value of communities which were determined not to be impaired at september 30 2011 the largest concentrations were in california 23 illinois 16 arizona 11 florida 10 and texas 9 it is possible that our estimate of undiscounted cash flows from these communities may change and could result in a future need to record impairment charges to adjust the carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair value there are several factors which could lead to changes in the estimates of undiscounted future cash flows for a given community the most significant of these include pricing and incentive levels actually realized by the community the rate at which the homes are sold and the costs incurred to develop the lots and construct the homes the pricing and incentive levels are often interrelated with sales pace within a community such that a price reduction can typically be expected to increase the sales pace further both of these factors are heavily influenced by the competitive pressures facing a given community from both new homes and existing homes some of which may result from foreclosures if conditions in the broader economy homebuilding industry or specific markets in which we operate worsen and as we reevaluate specific community pricing and incentives construction and development plans and our overall land sale strategies we may be required to evaluate additional communities or reevaluate previously impaired communities for potential impairment these evaluations may result in additional impairment charges 

 

based on our quarterly reviews of land and lot option contracts we have written off earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs related to contracts for land or lots which are not expected to be acquired during fiscal 2011 and 2010 we wrote off 81 million and 24 million respectively of earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs related to land option contracts at september 30 2011 outstanding earnest money deposits associated with our portfolio of land and lot option purchase contracts totaled 146 million and preacquisition costs related to these contracts totaled 96 million 

 

the inventory impairment charges and writeoffs of earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs reduced total homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding revenues by approximately 130 basis points in fiscal 2011 compared to 150 basis points in fiscal 2010

selling general and administrative sga expense 

 

sga expense from homebuilding activities decreased 8 to 4800 million in 2011 from 5232 million in 2010 as a percentage of homebuilding revenues sga expense increased 140 basis points to 135 in 2011 from 121 in 2010 the largest component of our homebuilding sga expense is employee compensation and related costs which represented 60 and 58 of sga costs in 2011 and 2010 respectively these costs decreased by 6 to 2865 million in 2011 from 3040 million in 2010 primarily due to a decline in the level of incentive compensation and to a lesser extent to a decline in the number of employees our homebuilding operations employed approximately 2380 and 2500 employees at september 30 2011 and 2010 respectively a reduction in advertising costs also contributed to the decline in sga expenses 

 

we continually attempt to adjust our sga infrastructure to support our expected closings volume however we cannot make assurances that our actions will permit us to maintain or improve upon the current sga expense as a percentage of revenues it has become more difficult to reduce sga expense as the size of our operations has decreased if revenues decrease and we are unable to sufficiently adjust our sga future sga expense as a percentage of revenues will increase 

 

interest incurred 

 

homebuilding interest costs are incurred on our homebuilding debt outstanding during the period comparing fiscal 2011 with fiscal 2010 interest incurred related to homebuilding debt decreased 25 to 1302 million primarily due to a 26 decrease in our average homebuilding debt 

 

we capitalize homebuilding interest to inventory during active development and construction due to the decrease in the size of our operations our inventory under active development and construction has been lower than our debt level therefore a portion of our interest incurred is expensed we expensed 505 million of homebuilding interest during fiscal 2011 compared to 863 million of interest during fiscal 2010 the reduction in interest expensed in the current year is a result of a decline in interest incurred during the year interest amortized to cost of sales excluding interest written off with inventory impairment charges declined to 30 of total home and landlot cost of sales in fiscal 2011 from 34 in 2010 as a result of more home closings on acquired finished lots and decreases in construction times 

 

loss on early retirement of debt 

 

during fiscal 2011 in addition to repaying maturing senior notes we retired 3192 million principal amount of our senior notes prior to their maturity compared to 8222 million in fiscal 2010 as a result of the early retirement of these notes we recognized net losses of 108 million and 49 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively which represent the difference between the principal amount of the notes and the aggregate purchase price plus any unamortized discounts and fees the net loss in fiscal 2011 includes a loss of 63 million for the call premium and writeoff of unamortized fees related to the early redemption of the 5375 senior notes due 2012 the net loss in fiscal 2010 includes a loss of 20 million for the call premium and writeoff of unamortized fees related to the early redemption of the 5875 senior notes due 2013 

 

other income 

 

other income net of other expenses associated with homebuilding activities was 80 million in 2011 compared to 104 million in 2010 the largest component of other income in both years was interest income 

 

goodwill 

 

in performing our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of september 30 2011 and 2010 we determined that our goodwill balance of 159 million all of which relates to our south central reporting segment was not impaired 

homebuilding results by reporting region 

 

 

 

 

  

east region  — homebuilding revenues decreased 11 in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to decreases in the number of homes closed in the majority of the region’s markets the largest decrease in closings volume occurred in our new jersey and charlotte markets the region reported a loss before income taxes of 135 million in 2011 compared to a loss of 63 million in 2010 primarily as a result of declines in revenue and gross profit inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs were 46 million and 86 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively gross profit from home sales as a percentage of home sales revenue home sales gross profit percentage decreased 200 basis points in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 due to the increased use of incentives to sell homes and weakening market conditions during the current year although total sga expenses in fiscal 2011 decreased from the prior year they increased as a percentage of homebuilding revenues by 120 basis points in 2011 

 

midwest region  — homebuilding revenues decreased 21 in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to decreases in the number of homes closed in all of the region’s markets the region reported a loss before income taxes of 137 million in 2011 compared to a loss of 313 million in 2010 the improvement in the current year was primarily a result of fewer inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs which were 09 million in fiscal 2011 compared to 220 million in fiscal 2010 however weak conditions persisted in the chicago market which again contributed substantially to the region’s loss home sales gross profit percentage decreased 190 basis points in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 due to weakening market conditions compared to the prior year although total sga expenses in fiscal 2011 decreased from the prior year they increased as a percentage of homebuilding revenues by 110 basis points in 2011 

 

southeast region  — homebuilding revenues decreased 7 in 2011 compared to 2010 due to a decrease in the number of homes closed partially offset by an increase in the average selling price of those homes the region reported a loss before income taxes of 199 million in fiscal 2011 compared to a loss of 75 million in fiscal 2010 primarily as a result of declines in revenue and gross profit these results generally reflected softening across most markets from the expiration of the federal homebuyer tax credit as well as more challenging conditions in the orlando market inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs were 174 million and 175 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively home sales gross profit percentage decreased 110 basis points in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 due to increased warranty costs in our orlando and pensacola markets as a percentage of homebuilding revenues total sga expenses increased 110 basis points in fiscal 2011 

south central region  — homebuilding revenues decreased 22 in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to decreases in the number of homes closed in all of the region’s markets partially offset by an increase in the average selling prices of those homes while we continued to be profitable in all markets in the region overall the region reported a decline in income before income taxes to 524 million in fiscal 2011 from 834 million in fiscal 2010 the reduced income was the result of closing fewer homes with the expiration of the federal homebuyer tax credit leading to declines in revenue and gross profit inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs were 07 million and 140 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively home sales gross profit percentage decreased 100 basis points in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 due to lower margins in the majority of the region’s markets caused by an increase in construction and lot costs as a percentage of revenues although total sga expenses in fiscal 2011 decreased from the prior year they increased as a percentage of homebuilding revenues by 150 basis points in 2011 our central texas dallas and houston markets continue to be the most profitable in the region 

 

southwest region  — homebuilding revenues decreased 29 in 2011 compared to 2010 due to decreases in the number of homes closed in all of the region’s markets partially offset by an increase in the average selling price of those homes the region reported a loss before income taxes of 38 million fiscal 2011 compared to income before income taxes of 120 million in fiscal 2010 primarily as a result of declines in revenue and gross profit in all of its markets with phoenix experiencing the worst conditions home sales gross profit percentage decreased 200 basis points in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 primarily as a result of the increased use of incentives to sell homes and weakening market conditions in all of the region’s markets also contributing to the decrease in gross profit percentage in the current year inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs increased to 47 million from 06 million in the prior year although total sga expenses in fiscal 2011 decreased from the prior year they increased as a percentage of homebuilding revenues by 170 basis points in 2011 

 

west region  — homebuilding revenues decreased 18 in 2011 compared to 2010 due to decreases in the number of homes closed in all of the region’s markets partially offset by an increase in the average selling price of those homes the seattle market continued to generate the highest profits while the inland central california markets again did not achieve profitability the region reported a loss before income taxes of 85 million in fiscal 2011 compared to income before income taxes of 278 million in fiscal 2010 primarily as a result of a decline in revenue and increased impairment charges inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs were 171 million in fiscal 2011 compared to 20 million in fiscal 2010 home sales gross profit percentage decreased 40 basis points in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 although total sga expenses in fiscal 2011 decreased from the prior year they increased as a percentage of homebuilding revenues by 150 basis points in 2011 

land and lot position and homes in inventory 

 

the following is a summary of our land and lot position and homes in inventory at september 30 2011 and 2010 

 

 

 

 

  

at september 30 2011 we owned or controlled approximately 112700 lots compared to approximately 119400 lots at september 30 2010 of the 112700 total lots we controlled approximately 26900 lots 24 with a total remaining purchase price of approximately 9187 million through land and lot option purchase contracts with a total of 146 million in earnest money deposits at september 30 2011 approximately 22500 of our owned lots were finished 

 

we had a total of approximately 10500 homes in inventory including approximately 1100 model homes at september 30 2011 compared to approximately 9500 homes in inventory including approximately 1200 model homes at september 30 2010 of our total homes in inventory approximately 5600 and 5200 were unsold at september 30 2011 and 2010 respectively at september 30 2011 approximately 2800 of our unsold homes were completed of which approximately 600 homes had been completed for more than six months at september 30 2010 approximately 3200 of our unsold homes were completed of which approximately 800 homes had been completed for more than six months 

 

our current strategy is to take advantage of market opportunities by entering into new lot option contracts to purchase finished lots in selected communities to potentially increase sales volumes and profitability we will attempt to renegotiate existing lot option contracts as necessary to reduce our lot costs and better match the scheduled lot purchases with new home demand in each community we also manage our inventory of homes under construction by selectively starting construction on unsold homes to capture new home demand while monitoring the number and aging of unsold homes and aggressively marketing our unsold completed homes in inventory 

fiscal year ended september 30 2010 compared to fiscal year ended september 30 2009 

 

the following tables and related discussion set forth key operating and financial data for our homebuilding operations by reporting segment as of and for the fiscal years ended september 30 2010 and 2009 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

net sales orders 

 

the value of net sales orders increased 15 to 40110 million 19375 homes in 2010 from 34984 million 17034 homes in 2009 the number of net sales orders increased 14 in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 these results were impacted by increased levels of affordability resulting from lower home sales prices declines in the number of new homes available for sale a low mortgage interest rate environment and the federal government’s monetary and fiscal policies and programs including the federal homebuyer tax credit which accelerated sales demand during the first half of the year although these results reflected improvement over the prior year the significant decline in demand subsequent to the expiration of the federal tax credit indicated that market conditions remained weak 

 

in comparing fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2009 the value of net sales orders increased in most of our market regions with the largest percentage increases occurring in our east southeast and south central regions resulting from new communities in the carolinas florida and texas as well as lower cancellation rates achieved in these regions conversely our midwest region experienced a 13 decline in net sales orders due to weak demand in our chicago market fluctuations in the value of net sales orders were primarily due to the change in the number of homes sold in each respective region and to a much lesser extent small fluctuations 

in the average selling price of those homes the average price of our net sales orders in 2010 was 207000 an increase of 1 from the 205400 average in 2009 

 

our annual sales order cancellation rate was 26 in fiscal 2010 compared to 30 in fiscal 2009 while an improvement from the prior year this elevated cancellation rate was still above historical levels reflecting the challenges in most of our homebuilding markets 

 

 

 

sales order backlog 

 

our homes in backlog at september 30 2010 declined 27 from the prior year as a result of closing homes at a greater rate than our sales pace during the latter half of the year and the effects of the federal homebuyer tax credit that was in effect at september 30 2009 

 

 

 

home sales revenue 

 

revenues from home sales increased 21 to 43023 million 20875 homes closed in 2010 from 35636 million 16703 homes closed in 2009 the average selling price of homes closed during 2010 was 206100 down 3 from the 213400 average in 2009 during fiscal 2010 home sales revenues increased in most of our market regions with significant increases in our east southeast and south central markets these increases resulted from increases in the number of homes closed 

 

the number of homes closed in 2010 increased 25 due to increases in five of our six market regions the increase in home closings reflects the impact of the firsttime homebuyer’s federal tax credit which initially required buyers to close on their home purchase transaction by june 30 2010 we believe this helped stimulate demand for homes that could close during the first nine months of fiscal 2010 we also believe that our operating strategy of selectively starting construction on unsold homes which made additional housing inventory available to close by june 30 2010 led to increased home closings volume by better capturing this 

demand the southwest region had an 8 decrease in homes closed due to both weak demand in the phoenix market and our prior year efforts to reduce completed home inventories in that market 

 

 

 

home sales gross profit 

 

gross profit from home sales increased by 59 to 7440 million in 2010 from 4675 million in 2009 and as a percentage of home sales revenues increased 420 basis points to 173 approximately 350 basis points of the increase in the home sales gross profit percentage was a result of the average cost of our homes declining by more than our average selling prices caused largely by a reduction in our construction costs on homes closed during fiscal 2010 the reduction in construction costs primarily resulted from changes in product design as well as cost reductions obtained from our suppliers and subcontractors in prior periods in addition the increase in home sales gross profit was partially due to our efforts beginning in fiscal 2009 to acquire lot positions in new communities and construct and close houses from these new projects homes closed on these acquired finished lots yielded higher gross profits than those on land and lots acquired in prior years approximately 70 basis points of the increase was due to a decrease in the amortization of capitalized interest and property taxes as a percentage of homes sales revenues resulting from reductions in our interest and property taxes incurred over the year as well as more closings occurring on acquired finished lots rather than internally developed lots 

 

land sales revenue 

 

land sales revenues decreased 82 to 74 million in 2010 from 403 million in 2009 of the 403 million of revenues in fiscal 2009 269 million related to land sale transactions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 for which recognition of the revenue had been deferred due to the terms of the sale 

 

inventory impairments and land option cost writeoffs 

 

during fiscal 2010 when we performed our quarterly inventory impairment analyses by reviewing the performance and outlook for all of our communities the assumptions utilized reflected our expectation of continued challenging conditions and uncertainties in the homebuilding industry and in our markets as of september 30 2010 we evaluated communities with a combined carrying value of 4098 million for impairment in performing this analysis we utilized a range of discount rates for communities of 14 to 20 through this evaluation process we determined that communities with a carrying value of 631 million as of september 30 2010 were impaired as a result during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 we recorded impairment charges of 291 million to reduce the carrying value of the impaired communities to their estimated fair value as compared to 1749 million in the same period of the prior year the fourth quarter charges combined with impairment charges recorded earlier in the year resulted in total inventory impairment 

charges of 623 million and 3778 million during fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively during fiscal 2010 approximately 93 of the impairment charges were recorded to residential land and lots and land held for development and approximately 7 of the charges were recorded to construction in progress and finished homes inventory compared to 85 and 15 respectively in fiscal 2009 

 

during fiscal 2010 and 2009 we wrote off 24 million and 299 million respectively of earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs related to land option contracts the inventory impairment charges and writeoffs of earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs reduced total homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding revenues by approximately 150 basis points in fiscal 2010 compared to 1130 basis points in fiscal 2009

selling general and administrative sga expense 

 

sga expense from homebuilding activities increased slightly to 5232 million in 2010 from 5230 million in 2009 as a percentage of homebuilding revenues sga expense decreased 240 basis points to 121 in 2010 from 145 in 2009 the largest component of our homebuilding sga expense is employee compensation and related costs which represented 58 and 55 of sga costs in 2010 and 2009 respectively these costs increased by 6 to 3040 million in 2010 from 2872 million in 2009 our homebuilding operations employed approximately 2500 and 2300 employees at september 30 2010 and 2009 respectively 

 

interest incurred 

 

comparing fiscal 2010 with fiscal 2009 interest incurred related to homebuilding debt decreased 16 to 1732 million primarily due to a 19 decrease in our average homebuilding debt we expensed 863 million of homebuilding interest during fiscal 2010 compared to 1002 million of interest during fiscal 2009 interest amortized to cost of sales excluding interest written off with inventory impairment charges was 34 of total home and landlot cost of sales in 2010 compared to 39 in 2009 

 

lossgain on early retirement of debt 

 

we retired 8222 million principal amount of our senior and senior subordinated notes prior to their maturity during fiscal 2010 compared to 3803 million in fiscal 2009 related to the early retirement of these notes we recognized a net loss of 49 million in fiscal 2010 and a net gain of 115 million in fiscal 2009 the loss in fiscal 2010 includes a loss of 20 million for the call premium and writeoff of unamortized fees related to the early redemption of our 5875 senior notes due 2013 the gain in fiscal 2009 was partially offset by a 76 million loss related to the early termination of our revolving credit facility in may 2009 

 

other income 

 

other income net of other expenses associated with homebuilding activities was 104 million in 2010 compared to 128 million in 2009 the largest component of other income in both years was interest income 

goodwill 

 

in performing our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of september 30 2010 and 2009 we determined that our goodwill balance of 159 million all of which relates to our south central reporting segment was not impaired 

 

homebuilding results by reporting region 

 

 

 

 

  

east region  — homebuilding revenues increased 42 in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase in the number of homes closed with the largest increases occurring in our new jersey and carolina markets the region reported a loss before income taxes of 63 million in 2010 compared to a loss of 959 million in 2009 the results were due in part to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs totaling 86 million and 649 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively the region’s gross profit from home sales as a percentage of home sales revenue home sales gross profit percentage increased 390 basis points in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 the increase was a result of a reduction in the construction costs of our homes closed during fiscal 2010 also a reduction in the region’s sga expenses as a percentage of homebuilding revenues contributed 420 basis points to the region’s improvement in loss before income taxes as a percentage of homebuilding revenues as the region’s additional closing volume helped leverage these sga expenses 

 

midwest region  — homebuilding revenues increased 5 in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to increases in the number of homes closed in all of the region’s markets the region reported a loss before income taxes of 313 million in 2010 compared to a loss of 1049 million in 2009 the results were due in part to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs totaling 220 million and 547 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively substantially all of our fiscal 2010 impairments for this region related to projects in our chicago market the region’s home sales gross profit percentage increased 920 basis points in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 the increase was a result of higher margins primarily in our chicago and denver markets the denver market also benefitted from lower warranty costs on previously closed homes in fiscal 2010 a reduction in the region’s sga expenses as a percentage of homebuilding revenues contributed 280 basis points to the region’s improvement in loss before income taxes as a percentage of homebuilding revenues 

 

southeast region  — homebuilding revenues increased 31 in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase in the number of homes closed with the largest increases occurring in our central florida and atlanta markets the region reported a loss before income taxes of 75 million in fiscal 2010 compared to a 

loss of 732 million in fiscal 2009 the results were due in part to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs totaling 175 million and 380 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively the region’s home sales gross profit percentage increased 460 basis points in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 the increase was a result of higher margins on homes closed in the majority of the region’s markets led by our south and central florida markets the increase in homes sales gross profit percentage was a result of construction costs declining at a faster rate than the decline in average selling price on homes closed during fiscal 2010 also contributing to the increase in home sales gross profit are our efforts since the beginning of fiscal 2009 to acquire lot positions in new communities and construct and close houses from these new projects homes closed on these acquired finished lots were generally yielding higher gross profits than those on land and lots acquired in prior years in fiscal 2010 a reduction in the region’s sga expenses as a percentage of homebuilding revenues contributed 250 basis points to the region’s improvement in income before income taxes as a percentage of homebuilding revenues as the region’s additional closing volume helped leverage these sga expenses 

 

south central region  — homebuilding revenues increased 35 in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase in the number of homes closed with the largest increases occurring in our central texas houston and dallasfort worth markets the region reported income before income taxes of 834 million in fiscal 2010 compared to income of 49 million in fiscal 2009 the improvement was due in large part to the increase in revenue combined with the region’s home sales gross profit percentage increasing 290 basis points in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 due to higher margins on homes closed in the majority of the region’s markets these higher margins were primarily attributable to reductions in construction costs of our homes additionally a decrease in inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs which were 140 million in fiscal 2010 compared to 200 million in fiscal 2009 contributed to the region’s increase in income before income taxes 

 

southwest region  — homebuilding revenues decreased 14 in 2010 compared to 2009 due to a decrease in the number of homes closed and in the average selling price of those homes the decreases in revenues and homes closed were due to continuing weakness in the phoenix market the region reported income before income taxes of 120 million in 2010 compared to a loss before income taxes of 458 million in 2009 the loss in 2009 was due in large part to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs totaling 394 million the region’s home sales gross profit percentage increased 330 basis points in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 the increase was a result of the average cost of the region’s homes declining by more than the average selling prices driven in large part by reductions in home construction costs in addition the increase in home sales gross profit is partially due to our recent efforts to acquire lot positions in new communities and construct and close houses from these projects in fiscal 2010 a reduction in the region’s sga expenses both in absolute terms and as a percentage of homebuilding revenues also contributed to the improvement in income before income taxes 

 

west region  — homebuilding revenues increased 6 in 2010 compared to 2009 due to an increase in the number of homes closed which was partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price of those homes the largest increases in homes closed occurred in our seattle and southern california markets the region reported income before income taxes of 278 million in 2010 compared to a loss before income taxes of 2264 million in 2009 the loss in 2009 was due in large part to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs totaling 1907 million compared to 20 million in 2010 the region’s home sales gross profit percentage increased 400 basis points in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 the increase was a result of higher margins on homes closed in the majority of the region’s markets driven in large part by reductions in home construction costs in fiscal 2010 a reduction in the region’s sga expenses as a percentage of homebuilding revenues contributed 260 basis points to the region’s improvement in income before income taxes as a percentage of homebuilding revenues as a result of absolute reductions in sga expenses as well as the additional revenue providing more leverage against these costs

mortgage loan activity 

 

the volume of loans originated and brokered by our mortgage operations is directly related to the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations total firstlien loans originated or brokered by dhi mortgage for our homebuyers decreased by 19 in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 corresponding to the 20 decrease in the number of homes closed our mortgage capture rate the percentage of total home closings by our homebuilding operations for which dhi mortgage handled the homebuyers’ financing was 61 in both years 

 

home closings from our homebuilding operations constituted 85 of dhi mortgage loan originations in 2011 compared to 90 in 2010 reflecting dhi mortgage’s continued focus on supporting the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations the relatively lower captive percentage in the current year reflects a higher level of refinancing and new mortgage loan originations from nonhomebuilding sources than in the prior year 

 

the number of loans sold to thirdparty purchasers decreased by 15 in 2011 compared to 2010 consistent with the decrease in the number of loans originated of 14 between the years virtually all of the mortgage loans originated during fiscal 2011 and mortgage loans held for sale on september 30 2011 were eligible for sale to the federal national mortgage association fannie mae federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac or government national mortgage association ginnie mae approximately 89 of the mortgage loans sold by dhi mortgage during fiscal 2011 were sold to two major financial institutions pursuant to their loan purchase agreements late in fiscal 2011 one of these financial institutions announced their intention to exit their correspondent lending business and will no longer purchase loans from us beyond december 2011 we have been negotiating with other institutions to establish new loan purchase agreements with the combination of selling to potential new purchasers and increasing sales volumes to our existing purchasers we expect to be able to continue to originate and sell mortgage loans at our current volumes if we are unable to sell our mortgages to these or other purchasers our ability to originate and sell mortgage loans could be significantly reduced and the profitability of our financial services operations would be negatively impacted 

 

financial services revenues and expenses 

 

revenues from the financial services segment decreased 4 overall to 872 million in 2011 from 905 million in 2010 revenues from the sale of servicing rights and gains from sale of mortgages decreased 11 as a result of a 15 decrease in the volume of loans sold loan origination fees increased 3 despite a 14 decrease in loans originated due to small changes in pricing structure implemented during the current year 

 

charges related to recourse obligations decreased 15 to 116 million in fiscal 2011 from 137 million in fiscal 2010 the calculation of our required repurchase loss reserve is based upon an analysis of repurchase requests received our actual repurchases and losses through the disposition of such loans or requests discussions with our mortgage purchasers and analysis of the mortgages we originated while we believe that we have adequately reserved for losses on known and projected repurchase requests if either actual repurchases or the losses incurred resolving those repurchases exceed our expectations additional recourse expense may be incurred additionally a subsidiary of ours reinsured a portion of the private mortgage insurance written on loans originated by dhi mortgage in prior years charges to increase reserves for expected losses on the reinsured loans were 18 million and 19 million during fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively 

 

financial services general and administrative ga expense was 763 million in 2011 decreasing slightly from 772 million in 2010 as a percentage of financial services revenues excluding the effects of recourse and reinsurance expense ga expense increased to 758 in 2011 from 728 in 2010 the increase was due to the reduction in revenues resulting from the decrease in mortgage loan volume compared to the prior year fluctuations in financial services ga expense as a percentage of revenues can be expected to occur as some expenses are not directly related to mortgage loan volume or to changes in the amount of revenue earned

mortgage loan activity 

 

total firstlien loans originated or brokered by dhi mortgage for our homebuyers increased by 14 in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 corresponding to the 25 increase in the number of homes closed the percentage increase in loans originated was lower than the percentage increase in the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations due to a decrease in our mortgage capture rate to 61 in 2010 from 67 in 2009 

 

home closings from our homebuilding operations constituted 90 of dhi mortgage loan originations in 2010 compared to 83 in 2009 reflecting dhi mortgage’s continued focus on supporting the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations the relatively higher captive percentage in 2010 reflects a lower level of refinancing activity than in 2009 

 

the number of loans sold to thirdparty purchasers was virtually the same in 2010 as compared to 2009 while the number of loans originated increased by 5 virtually all of the mortgage loans originated during fiscal 2010 and mortgage loans held for sale on september 30 2010 were agencyeligible approximately 86 of the mortgage loans sold by dhi mortgage during fiscal 2010 were sold to two major financial institutions pursuant to their loan purchase agreements 

 

financial services revenues and expenses 

 

revenues from the financial services segment increased 69 to 905 million in 2010 from 537 million in 2009 loan origination fees decreased 5 to 177 million in 2010 from 186 million in 2009 while the number of loans originated increased 5 during the same period loan origination fees recorded in fiscal 2009 benefitted from the adoption of the financial accounting standards board’s fasb authoritative guidance for fair value measurements of certain financial instruments which resulted in the recognition of 24 million of loan origination fees and 50 million of general and administrative ga costs related to prior period loan originations revenues from the sale of servicing rights and gains from sale of mortgages increased 5 to 596 million in 2010 from 568 million in 2009 charges related to recourse obligations were 137 million in fiscal 2010 compared to 332 million in fiscal 2009 also a subsidiary of ours reinsured a portion of private mortgage insurance written on loans originated by dhi mortgage in prior years charges to increase reserves for expected losses on the reinsured loans were 19 million and 149 million during fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively 

 

financial services ga expense decreased 1 to 772 million in 2010 from 781 million in 2009 but increased 6 when excluding 50 million of compensation costs recognized in fiscal 2009 upon the adoption of the fasb’s authoritative guidance for fair value measurements as discussed above the largest component of our financial services ga expense is employee compensation and related costs which represented 78 and 75 of ga costs in 2010 and 2009 respectively excluding the 50 million adjustment discussed above these costs increased 14 to 605 million in 2010 from 533 million in 2009 the increase in the current year relates to an increase in the number of financial services employees to approximately 700 at september 30 2010 from 600 at september 30 2009 to support our increased volume and more stringent mortgage purchaser underwriting guidelines 

 

as a percentage of financial services revenues excluding the effects of recourse and reinsurance expense ga expense decreased to 728 in 2010 from 767 in 2009 the decrease was primarily due to the adoption in 2009 of the fasb’s authoritative guidance for fair value measurements of certain financial instruments as discussed above partially offset by additional costs incurred to support more stringent mortgage purchaser underwriting guidelines 

results of operations — consolidated 

 

fiscal year ended september 30 2011 compared to fiscal year ended september 30 2010 

 

income before income taxes 

 

income before income taxes for fiscal 2011 was 121 million compared to 995 million for fiscal 2010 the difference in our operating results for 2011 compared to a year ago is primarily due to a lower volume of homes closed which resulted in lower revenues 

 

income taxes 

 

in fiscal 2011 our income tax benefit was 597 million compared to a benefit of 1456 million in 2010 the income tax benefit in fiscal 2011 was due to the reduction of our accrual for unrecognized tax benefits and corresponding interest by 614 million partially offset by an accrual for state income taxes of 17 million in fiscal 2010 a tax law change regarding net operating loss nol carrybacks resulted in an income tax benefit of 2083 million which was partially offset by an increase in unrecognized tax benefits and state income tax expense we do not have meaningful effective tax rates in these years because our net deferred tax assets are offset fully by a valuation allowance 

 

we had income taxes receivable of 124 million and 160 million at september 30 2011 and 2010 respectively the income taxes receivable at september 30 2011 relates to federal tax refunds we expect to receive 

 

at september 30 2011 we had federal nol carryforwards of 4362 million that expire in fiscal 2030 and 2031 also at september 30 2011 we had tax benefits for state nol carryforwards of 887 million that expire beginning at various times depending on the tax jurisdiction from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2031 at september 30 2011 we had federal tax credit carryforwards of 32 million that expire in fiscal years 2029 through 2031 

 

at september 30 2011 and 2010 we had net deferred tax assets of 8485 million and 9026 million respectively offset by valuation allowances of 8485 million and 9026 million respectively the realization of our deferred tax assets ultimately depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income in future periods we continue to analyze the positive and negative evidence in determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to our deferred tax assets on a jurisdictional basis a significant part of the negative evidence we consider comes from our continued threeyear cumulative pretax loss position which was 445 million at the end of fiscal 2011 currently this loss is largely the result of pretax losses incurred in fiscal 2009 the valuation allowance could be reduced in future periods when we are no longer in a threeyear cumulative pretax loss position and if there is sufficient evidence to support a conclusion that it is not needed for some portion or all of our deferred tax assets realization of a significant portion of our deferred tax assets for state nol carryforwards is more unlikely than the remaining deferred tax assets due to the need to generate a substantially higher level of taxable income prior to the expirations of the various state carryforward periods which expire sooner than our federal nol carryforwards the accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future results could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 

 

unrecognized tax benefits are the differences between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefits recognized for accounting purposes at september 30 2011 and 2010 all tax positions if recognized would affect our annual effective tax rate the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was 163 million and 650 million as of september 30 2011 and 2010 respectively the decrease in unrecognized tax benefits resulted from us receiving a favorable result from the internal revenue service irs on a ruling request concerning the capitalization of inventory costs and a reduction in our accrual for state income tax issues 

we classify interest expense and penalties on income taxes as income tax expense during fiscal 2011 and 2010 we recognized interest expense benefit related to unrecognized tax benefits of 127 million and 116 million respectively in our consolidated statements of operations at september 30 2011 and 2010 our total accrued interest expense relating to unrecognized tax benefits was 51 million and 178 million respectively and there were no accrued penalties as a result of our full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets all accrued interest expense would affect our annual effective tax rate if the associated tax positions were recognized 

 

a reduction of 25 million in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest with respect to state issues is reasonably possible within the next 12 months and would result in an income tax benefit in our consolidated statement of operations 

 

we are subject to federal income tax and to income tax in multiple states the statute of limitations for our major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for fiscal years 2004 through 2011 we are currently being audited by the irs for fiscal years 2006 and 2007 and by various states our federal nol refunds from fiscal 2008 and 2009 are subject to congressional joint committee review 

 

fiscal year ended september 30 2010 compared to fiscal year ended september 30 2009 

 

income loss before income taxes 

 

income before income taxes for fiscal 2010 was 995 million compared to a loss before income taxes of 5568 million for fiscal 2009 the difference in our operating results for 2010 compared to 2009 is primarily due to increased revenue from the higher volume of homes closed a higher gross profit from home sales revenues and lower inventory impairment charges 

 

income taxes 

 

income tax benefit in fiscal 2010 was 1456 million compared to a benefit of 70 million in 2009 a tax law change enacted during fiscal 2010 allowed us to carry back our fiscal 2009 nol five years this resulted in a benefit from income taxes of 2083 million during fiscal 2010 which was partially offset by an increase in unrecognized tax benefits and state income tax expense we do not have meaningful effective tax rates in these years because of the valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets 

 

we had income taxes receivable of 160 million and 2931 million at september 30 2010 and 2009 respectively related to federal and state nol carrybacks and amended returns at september 30 2010 and 2009 we had net deferred income tax assets of 9026 million and 10739 million respectively offset by valuation allowances of 9026 million and 10739 million respectively 

 

overview of capital resources and liquidity 

 

we have historically funded our homebuilding and financial services operations with cash flows from operating activities borrowings under bank credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities during the past few years we have generated cash flows through reductions in assets as well as through profitable operations our cash generation has also benefitted from income tax refunds the generation of cash flow has allowed us to increase our liquidity and strengthen our balance sheet providing us with the operational flexibility to invest in market opportunities as they arise and adjust to future homebuilding market conditions and our expectations for these conditions we intend to maintain adequate liquidity and balance sheet strength and we will continue to evaluate opportunities to access the capital markets as they become available 

 

at september 30 2011 our ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital was 180 an increase of 190 basis points from 161 at september 30 2010 net homebuilding debt to total capital consists of homebuilding notes payable net of cash and marketable securities divided by total capital net of cash and marketable securities homebuilding notes payable net of cash and marketable securities plus total equity the increase in our ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital at september 30 2011 as compared to the ratio a year earlier was due to a decrease in cash the effect of which was largely offset by a reduction in our debt balance while the challenging conditions persist in the homebuilding industry we intend to maintain a ratio 

of net homebuilding debt to total capital below our historic target operating range of 45 however future periodend net homebuilding debt to total capital ratios may be higher than the 180 ratio achieved at september 30 2011 

 

we believe that the ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital is useful in understanding the leverage employed in our homebuilding operations and comparing us with other homebuilders we exclude the debt of our financial services business because it is separately capitalized and its obligation under its repurchase agreement is substantially collateralized and not guaranteed by our parent company or any of our homebuilding entities because of its capital function we include our homebuilding cash and marketable securities as a reduction of our homebuilding debt and total capital for comparison to our ratios of net homebuilding debt to capital above at september 30 2011 and 2010 our ratios of homebuilding debt to total capital without netting cash and marketable securities balances were 377 and 443 respectively 

 

we believe that we will be able to fund our nearterm working capital needs and debt obligations from existing cash resources and our mortgage repurchase facility for our longerterm capital requirements we will evaluate the need to issue new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets or obtain additional bank financing as market conditions may permit 

 

homebuilding capital resources 

 

cash and cash equivalents  — at september 30 2011 we had available homebuilding cash and cash equivalents of 7155 million 

 

marketable securities  — at september 30 2011 we had marketable securities of 2976 million our marketable securities consist of us treasury securities government agency securities corporate debt securities and certificates of deposit 

 

secured letter of credit agreements  — we have secured letter of credit agreements which require us to deposit cash in an amount approximating the balance of letters of credit outstanding as collateral with the issuing banks at september 30 2011 and 2010 the amount of cash restricted for this purpose totaled 475 million and 526 million respectively and is included in homebuilding restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheets 

 

public unsecured debt  — the indentures governing our senior notes impose restrictions on the creation of secured debt and liens at september 30 2011 we were in compliance with all of the limitations and restrictions that form a part of the public debt obligations 

 

shelf registration statement  — we have an automatically effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec in september 2009 registering debt and equity securities which we may issue from time to time in amounts to be determined 

 

financial services capital resources 

 

cash and cash equivalents  — at september 30 2011 the amount of financial services cash and cash equivalents was 171 million 

 

mortgage repurchase facility  — our mortgage subsidiary dhi mortgage has a mortgage repurchase facility that is accounted for as a secured financing the mortgage repurchase facility provides financing and liquidity to dhi mortgage by facilitating purchase transactions in which dhi mortgage transfers eligible loans to the counterparties against the transfer of funds by the counterparties thereby becoming purchased loans dhi mortgage then has the right and obligation to repurchase the purchased loans upon their sale to thirdparty purchasers in the secondary market or within specified time frames from 45 to 120 days in accordance with the terms of the mortgage repurchase facility the total capacity of the facility was 150 million for the period from june 29 2011 through october 20 2011 after which time it was reduced to 100 million the maturity date of the facility is march 4 2012 

 

as of september 30 2011 2515 million of mortgage loans held for sale were pledged under the mortgage repurchase facility these mortgage loans had a collateral value of 2363 million dhi mortgage 

has the option to fund a portion of its repurchase obligations in advance as a result of advance paydowns totaling 1198 million dhi mortgage had an obligation of 1165 million outstanding under the mortgage repurchase facility at september 30 2011 at a 38 annual interest rate 

 

the mortgage repurchase facility is not guaranteed by either dr horton inc or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt the facility contains financial covenants as to the mortgage subsidiary’s minimum required tangible net worth its maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and its minimum required liquidity these covenants are measured and reported monthly at september 30 2011 dhi mortgage was in compliance with all of the conditions and covenants of the mortgage repurchase facility 

 

in the past our mortgage subsidiary has been able to renew or extend its mortgage credit facility on satisfactory terms prior to its maturity and obtain temporary additional commitments through amendments to the credit agreement during periods of higher than normal volumes of mortgages held for sale the liquidity of our financial services business depends upon its continued ability to renew and extend the mortgage repurchase facility or to obtain other additional financing in sufficient capacities 

 

operating cash flow activities 

 

during fiscal 2011 net cash provided by our operating activities was 149 million compared to 7094 million during fiscal 2010 during the prior year a significant portion of the net cash provided by our operating activities was due to federal income tax refunds and the profit we generated during the year the net cash provided by our operating activities during the past few years has resulted in substantial liquidity this liquidity gives us the flexibility to determine the appropriate operating strategy for each of our communities and to take advantage of opportunities in the market we have limited our purchases of undeveloped land and our development spending on land we own to generally smaller projects or phases which yield finished lot quantities in line with expected nearterm home production additionally we are purchasing or contracting to purchase finished lots in many markets to potentially increase sales and home closing volumes and return to sustainable profitability depending upon future homebuilding market conditions and our expectations for these conditions we may use a portion of our cash balances to increase our inventories 

 

investing cash flow activities 

 

during fiscal 2011 net cash used in our investing activities was 193 million compared to 3180 million in 2010 during the current year 3001 million was used to purchase marketable securities and proceeds from the sale or maturity of securities during the year totaled 2925 million in the prior year 3280 million was used to purchase marketable securities and proceeds from the sale of securities totaled 277 million additionally in fiscal 2011 and 2010 we used 163 million and 192 million respectively to invest in purchases of property and equipment primarily model home furniture and office equipment these purchases are generally not significant relative to our total assets or cash flows also affecting our investing cash flows are changes in restricted cash which decreased 46 million and 15 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively changes in restricted cash are primarily due to fluctuations in the balance of our outstanding letters of credit 

 

financing cash flow activities 

 

during the last three years most of our shortterm financing needs have been funded with cash generated from operations and borrowings available under our financial services credit facility longterm financing needs of our homebuilding operations have historically been funded with the issuance of senior unsecured debt securities through the public capital markets during fiscal 2011 we repaid through maturities redemptions and repurchases a total of 4954 million principal amount of various issues of senior notes for an aggregate purchase price of 5053 million plus accrued interest during fiscal 2010 we repaid through maturities redemptions and repurchases a total of 10163 million principal amount of various issues of senior notes for an aggregate purchase price of 10182 million plus accrued interest during fiscal 2011 we also used cash for the repurchase of our common stock as discussed below 

consistent with dividends paid in fiscal 2009 and 2010 our board of directors approved four quarterly cash dividends of 00375 per common share during fiscal 2011 the last of these was paid on august 24 2011 to stockholders of record on august 12 2011 on november 10 2011 our board of directors approved a cash dividend of 00375 per common share payable on december 13 2011 to stockholders of record on december 2 2011 the declaration of future cash dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon among other things future earnings cash flows capital requirements our financial condition and general business conditions 

 

changes in capital structure 

 

on august 1 2011 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 500 million of debt securities and 100 million of our common stock effective through july 31 2012 at september 30 2011 4229 million of the debt authorization was remaining and all of the common stock authorization was remaining 

 

in october 2011 through unsolicited transactions we repurchased 108 million principal amount of our 65 senior notes due 2016 which further reduced the debt repurchase authorization 

 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2011 we repurchased 3544838 shares of our common stock at a total cost of 386 million 

 

in recent years our primary nonoperating use of available capital has been to repay debt and in fiscal 2011 we also made limited stock repurchases at prices we believe to be attractive we continue to evaluate our alternatives for future nonoperating sources and uses of our available capital including debt repayments dividend payments or common stock repurchases while considering the overall level of our cash balances within the constraints of our balance sheet leverage targets and our liquidity targets 

 

contractual cash obligations commercial commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

our primary contractual cash obligations for our homebuilding and financial services segments are payments under our debt agreements and lease payments under operating leases purchase obligations of our homebuilding segment represent specific performance requirements under lot option purchase agreements that may require us to purchase land contingent upon the land seller meeting certain obligations we expect to fund our contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business through a combination of our existing cash resources cash flows generated from operations renewed or amended mortgage repurchase facilities and if needed or believed advantageous the issuance of new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets as market conditions may permit 

 

our future cash requirements for contractual obligations as of september 30 2011 are presented below 

 

 

 

 

  

at september 30 2011 our homebuilding operations had outstanding letters of credit of 469 million all of which were cash collateralized and surety bonds of 6892 million issued by third parties to secure performance under various contracts we expect that our performance obligations secured by these letters of credit and bonds will generally be completed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms when we complete our performance obligations the related letters of credit and bonds are generally released shortly thereafter leaving us with no continuing obligations we have no material thirdparty guarantees 

 

our mortgage subsidiary enters into various commitments related to the lending activities of our mortgage operations further discussion of these commitments is provided in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” under part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

 

we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts to acquire land or lots for the construction of homes lot option contracts enable us to control significant lot positions with limited capital investment and substantially reduce the risks associated with land ownership and development within the land and lot option purchase contracts at september 30 2011 there were a limited number of contracts representing 82 million of remaining purchase price subject to specific performance clauses which may require us to purchase the land or lots upon the land sellers meeting their obligations further discussion of our land option contracts is provided in the “land and lot position and homes in inventory” section included herein 

 

seasonality 

 

we have typically experienced seasonal variations in our quarterly operating results and capital requirements prior to the current downturn in the homebuilding industry we generally had more homes under construction closed more homes and had greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year this seasonal activity increased our working capital requirements for our homebuilding operations during the third and fourth fiscal quarters and increased our funding requirements for the mortgages we originated in our financial services segment at the end of these quarters as a result of seasonal activity our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year 

although the weakness in homebuilding market conditions mitigated our historical seasonal variations in recent years our home closings and income before income taxes were higher in the second half of fiscal 2011 than in the first half of the year however given the current uncertain outlook for market conditions we can make no assurances as to whether this pattern will continue beyond the current fiscal year 

 

inflation 

 

we may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation primarily because of higher land financing labor and material construction costs in addition higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers we attempt to pass through to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices however during periods of soft housing market conditions we may not be able to offset our cost increases with higher selling prices 

 

forwardlooking statements 

 

some of the statements contained in this report as well as in other materials we have filed or will file with the sec statements made by us in periodic press releases and oral statements we make to analysts stockholders and the press in the course of presentations about us may be construed as “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 and the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 forwardlooking statements are based on management’s beliefs as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to management these forwardlooking statements typically include the words “anticipate” “believe” “consider” “estimate” “expect” “forecast” “goal” “intend” “objective” “plan” “predict” “projection” “seek” “strategy” “target” “will” or other words of similar meaning any or all of the forwardlooking statements included in this report and in any other of our reports or public statements may not approximate actual experience and the expectations derived from them may not be realized due to risks uncertainties and other factors as a result actual results may differ materially from the expectations or results we discuss in the forwardlooking statements these risks uncertainties and other factors include but are not limited to

critical accounting policies 

 

general  — a comprehensive enumeration of the significant accounting policies of dr horton inc and subsidiaries is presented in note a to the accompanying financial statements as of september 30 2011 and 2010 and for the years ended september 30 2011 2010 and 2009 each of our accounting policies has been chosen based upon current authoritative literature that collectively comprises us generally accepted accounting principles gaap in instances where alternative methods of accounting are permissible under gaap we have chosen the method that most appropriately reflects the nature of our business the results of our operations and our financial condition and have consistently applied those methods over each of the periods presented in the financial statements the audit committee of our board of directors has reviewed and approved the accounting policies selected 

 

revenue recognition  — we generally recognize homebuilding revenue and related profit at the time of the closing of a sale when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer in situations where the buyer’s financing is originated by dhi mortgage our whollyowned mortgage subsidiary and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment the profit is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a thirdparty purchaser has been completed any profit on land sales is deferred until the full accrual method criteria are met we include proceeds from home closings held for our benefit at title companies in homebuilding cash when we execute sales contracts with our homebuyers or when we require advance payment from homebuyers for custom changes upgrades or options related to their homes we record the cash deposits received as liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are canceled we either retain or refund to the homebuyer deposits on canceled sales contracts depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances 

 

we recognize financial services revenues associated with our title operations as closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued both of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed we transfer substantially all underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies to thirdparty insurers we typically elect the fair value option for our mortgage loan originations mortgage loans held for sale are initially recorded at fair value based on either sale commitments or current market quotes and are adjusted for subsequent changes in fair value until the loan is sold net origination costs and fees associated with mortgage loans are recognized at the time of origination the expected net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of a loan are included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings at the time of commitment we generally do not retain or service originated mortgages rather we seek to sell the mortgages and related servicing rights to thirdparty purchasers interest income is earned from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold 

 

some mortgage loans are sold with limited recourse provisions based on historical experience discussions with our mortgage purchasers analysis of the mortgages we originated and current housing and credit market conditions we estimate and record a loss reserve for mortgage loans held in portfolio and mortgage loans held for sale as well as known and projected mortgage loan repurchase requests a 20 or 40 increase in the amount of expected mortgage loan repurchases and expected losses on mortgage loan repurchases would result in an increase of approximately 38 million or 82 million respectively in our reserve for expected mortgage loan repurchases 

 

marketable securities  — we invest a portion of our cash on hand by purchasing marketable securities with maturities in excess of three months we consider our investment portfolio to be availableforsale accordingly these investments are recorded at fair value at the end of a reporting period unrealized gains and losses on these investments net of tax are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on 

the consolidated balance sheet gains and losses realized upon the sale of marketable securities are determined by specific identification and are included in homebuilding other income 

 

inventories and cost of sales  — inventory includes the costs of direct land acquisition land development and home construction capitalized interest real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and home construction costs that we incur after development projects or homes are substantially complete such as utilities maintenance and cleaning are charged to sga expense as incurred all indirect overhead costs such as compensation of sales personnel division and region management and the costs of advertising and builder’s risk insurance are charged to sga expense as incurred 

 

land and development costs are typically allocated to individual residential lots on a prorata basis and the costs of residential lots are transferred to construction in progress when home construction begins we use the specific identification method for the purpose of accumulating home construction costs cost of sales for homes closed includes the specific construction costs of each home and all applicable land acquisition land development and related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each community any changes to the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial home closings in a community are allocated on a prorata basis to the homes in the community benefiting from the relevant development activity which generally relates to the remaining homes in the community 

 

when a home is closed we generally have not paid all incurred costs necessary to complete the home we record as a liability and as a charge to cost of sales the amount we determine will ultimately be paid related to completed homes that have been closed we compare our home construction budgets to actual recorded costs to determine the additional costs remaining to be paid on each closed home we monitor the accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on closed homes in subsequent months to the amount previously accrued although actual costs to be paid in the future on previously closed homes could differ from our current accruals differences in amounts historically have not been significant 

 

each quarter we review our inventory to determine whether recorded costs and any estimated costs required to complete each home or community are recoverable if the review indicates that an impairment loss is required an estimate of the loss is made and recorded to cost of sales in that quarter 

 

land inventory and related communities under development are reviewed for potential writedowns when impairment indicators are present we generally review our inventory at the community level and the inventory within each community is categorized as land held for development residential land and lots developed and under development andor construction in progress and finished homes based on the stage of production or plans for future development a particular community often includes inventory in more than one category in certain situations inventory may be analyzed separately for impairment purposes based on its product type eg single family homes evaluated separately from condominium parcels in reviewing each of our communities we determine if impairment indicators exist on inventory held and used by analyzing a variety of factors including but not limited to the following 

 

  

if indicators of impairment are present for a community we perform an analysis to determine if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts and if so impairment charges are required to be recorded if the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying amounts these estimates of cash flows are significantly impacted by community specific factors including 

estimates of the amounts and timing of future revenues and estimates of the amount of land development materials and labor costs which in turn may be impacted by the following local market conditions 

 

  

for those assets deemed to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets our determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams when an impairment charge for a community is determined the charge is then allocated to each lot in the community in the same manner as land and development costs are allocated to each lot the inventory within each community is categorized as construction in progress and finished homes residential land and lots developed and under development and land held for development based on the stage of production or plans for future development 

 

we typically do not purchase land for resale however when we own land or communities under development that no longer fit into our development and construction plans and we determine that the best use of the asset is the sale of the asset the project is accounted for as land held for sale assuming the land held for sale criteria are met we record land held for sale at the lesser of its carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell in performing the impairment evaluation for land held for sale we consider several factors including but not limited to prices for land in recent comparable sales transactions market analysis studies which include the estimated price a willing buyer would pay for the land and recent legitimate offers received if the estimated fair value less costs to sell an asset is less than the current carrying value the asset is written down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell 

 

impairment charges are also recorded on finished homes in substantially completed communities when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values are greater than the fair values less estimated costs to sell these homes 

 

the key assumptions relating to asset valuations are impacted by local market economic conditions and the actions of competitors and are inherently uncertain due to uncertainties in the estimation process actual results could differ from such estimates our quarterly assessments reflect management’s estimates and we continue to monitor the fair value of heldforsale assets through the disposition date 

 

land and lot option purchase contracts  — we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts to acquire land or lots for the construction of homes under these contracts we will fund a stated deposit in consideration for the right but not the obligation to purchase land or lots at a future point in time with predetermined terms under the terms of the option purchase contracts many of our option deposits are not refundable at our discretion 

 

option deposits and preacquisition costs we incur related to land and lot option purchase contracts are capitalized if all of the following conditions have been met 1 the costs are directly identifiable with the specific property 2 the costs would be capitalized if the property were already acquired and 3 acquisition of the property is probable meaning we are actively seeking and have the ability to acquire the property and there is no indication that the property is not available for sale we consider the following when determining if the acquisition of the property is probable 1 changes in market conditions subsequent to contracting for the purchase of the land 2 current contract terms including per lot price and required purchase dates and 

3 our current land position in the given market or submarket option deposits and capitalized preacquisition costs are expensed to cost of sales when we believe it is probable that we will no longer acquire the property under option and will not be able to recover these costs through other means 

 

certain of our option purchase contracts result in the creation of a variable interest in the entity holding the land parcel under option we determine if we are the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity based on our ability to control both 1 the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and 2 the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity based on this evaluation if we are the primary beneficiary of an entity with which we have entered into a land or lot option purchase contract the variable interest entity is consolidated creditors if any of these variable interest entities have no recourse against us 

 

fair value measurements  — the fasb’s authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes a threelevel hierarchy based upon the inputs to the valuation model of an asset or liability the fair value hierarchy and its application to our assets and liabilities is as follows 

 

  

when available we use quoted market prices in active markets to determine fair value we consider the principal market and nonperformance risk associated with our counterparties when determining the fair value measurements if applicable fair value measurements are used for our marketable securities mortgage loans held for sale interest rate lock commitments irlcs and other derivative instruments on a recurring basis and are used for inventories other mortgage loans and real estate owned on a nonrecurring basis when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

 

goodwill  — in september 2011 we early adopted the fasb’s authoritative guidance which allows an entity to assess qualitatively whether it is necessary to perform step one of the twostep annual goodwill impairment test if an entity believes as a result of its qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount the twostep goodwill impairment test is not required we performed a qualitative assessment of goodwill at september 30 2011 and determined that the twostep process was not necessary 

 

warranty claims  — we typically provide our homebuyers with a tenyear limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems a twoyear limited warranty on major mechanical systems and a oneyear limited warranty on other construction components since we subcontract our construction work to subcontractors who typically provide an indemnity and a certificate of insurance prior to receiving payments for their work claims relating to workmanship and materials are generally the primary responsibility of the subcontractors warranty liabilities are established by charging cost of sales for each home delivered the amounts charged are based on management’s estimate of expected warrantyrelated costs under all unexpired warranty obligation periods our warranty liability is based upon historical warranty cost experience in each market in which we operate and is adjusted as appropriate to reflect qualitative risks associated with the types of homes we build and the geographic areas in which we build them actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts a 10 change in the historical warranty rates used to estimate our warranty accrual would not result in a material change in our accrual 

 

insurance and legal claims  — we record expenses and liabilities related to the costs for exposures related to construction defects and claims and lawsuits incurred in the ordinary course of business including employment matters personal injury claims land development issues and contract disputes also we record 

expenses and liabilities for any estimated costs of potential construction defect claims and lawsuits including expected legal costs based on an analysis of our historical claims which includes an estimate of construction defect claims incurred but not yet reported related to the exposures for actual construction defect claims and estimates of construction defect claims incurred but not yet reported and other legal claims and lawsuits incurred in the ordinary course of business we estimate and record insurance receivables for these matters under applicable insurance policies when recovery is probable additionally we may have the ability to recover a portion of our legal expenses from our subcontractors when we have been named as an additional insured on their insurance policies the expenses liabilities and receivables related to these claims are subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends in construction defect claims relative to our markets the types of products we build claim settlement patterns insurance industry practices and legal interpretations among others a 10 increase in the claim rate and the average cost per claim used to estimate the selfinsured accruals would result in an increase of approximately 1219 million in our accrual and a 818 million increase in our receivable resulting in additional expense of 401 million while a 10 decrease in the claim rate and the average cost per claim would result in a decrease of approximately 944 million in our accrual and a 611 million decrease in our receivable resulting in a reduction in our expense of 333 million 

 

income taxes  — we calculate our income tax expense benefit using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and of tax loss and credit carryforwards in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods and in the jurisdictions in which those temporary differences become deductible in determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns judgment is required the accounting for deferred taxes is based upon an estimate of future results differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position changes in existing tax laws also affect actual tax results and the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 

 

interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in the financial statements as a component of income tax expense significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions we evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis our evaluations are based upon a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change 

 

stockbased compensation  — from time to time the compensation committee of our board of directors authorizes the issuance of options to purchase our common stock to employees and directors the committee approves grants out of amounts remaining available for grant from amounts formally authorized by our common stockholders options are granted at exercise prices which equal the market value of our common stock at the date of the grant generally the options vest over periods of 3 to 975 years and expire 10 years after the dates on which they were granted 

 

we measure and recognize compensation expense at an amount equal to the fair value of sharebased payments granted under compensation arrangements for all awards granted or modified after october 1 2005 using the modified prospective method compensation expense for any unvested stock option awards outstanding as of october 1 2005 is recognized on a straightline basis over the remaining vesting period we calculate the fair value of stock options using the blackscholes option pricing model determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions which involve a number of variables these variables include but are not limited to the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards the expected dividend yield and expected stock option exercise behavior in addition we also use judgment in estimating the number of sharebased awards that are expected to be forfeited

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

we are subject to interest rate risk on our longterm debt we monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and utilize both fixed and variable rate debt for fixed rate debt changes in interest rates generally affect the value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows conversely for variable rate debt changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument but may affect our future earnings and cash flows except in very limited circumstances we do not have an obligation to prepay fixedrate debt prior to maturity and as a result interest rate risk and changes in fair value would not have a significant impact on our cash flows related to our fixedrate debt until such time as we are required to refinance repurchase or repay such debt 

 

we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with our mortgage loan origination services we manage interest rate risk through the use of forward sales of mortgagebacked securities mbs eurodollar futures contracts edfc and put options on mbs and edfc use of the term “hedging instruments” in the following discussion refers to these securities collectively or in any combination we do not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 

 

interest rate lock commitments irlcs are extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and who meet defined credit and underwriting criteria typically the irlcs have a duration of less than six months some irlcs are committed immediately to a specific purchaser through the use of bestefforts whole loan delivery commitments while other irlcs are funded prior to being committed to thirdparty purchasers the hedging instruments related to irlcs are classified and accounted for as derivative instruments in an economic hedge with gains and losses recognized in current earnings hedging instruments related to funded uncommitted loans are accounted for at fair value with changes recognized in current earnings along with changes in the fair value of the funded uncommitted loans the fair value change related to the hedging instruments generally offsets the fair value change in the uncommitted loans and the fair value change which for the years ended september 30 2011 2010 and 2009 was not significant is recognized in current earnings at september 30 2011 hedging instruments used to mitigate interest rate risk related to uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale and uncommitted irlcs totaled 2570 million uncommitted irlcs totaled approximately 1961 million and uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale totaled approximately 809 million at september 30 2011

 item 1 business tableend  

dr horton inc is one of the largest homebuilding companies in the united states we construct and sell homes through our operating divisions in 26 states and 72 metropolitan markets of the united states primarily under the name of dr horton america’s builder  our common stock is included in the sp 500 index and listed on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol “dhi” unless the context otherwise requires the terms “dr horton” the “company” “we” and “our” used herein refer to dr horton inc a delaware corporation and its predecessors and subsidiaries 

 

donald r horton began our homebuilding business in 1978 in 1991 we were incorporated in delaware to acquire the assets and businesses of our predecessor companies which were residential home construction and development companies owned or controlled by mr horton in 1992 we completed our initial public offering of our common stock the growth of our company over the years was achieved by investing available capital into our existing homebuilding markets and into startup operations in new markets additionally we acquired other homebuilding companies which strengthened our position in existing markets and expanded our geographic presence and product offerings in other markets our homes generally range in size from 1000 to 4000 square feet and in price from 90000 to 700000 the current downturn in our industry has resulted in a substantial decrease in the size of our operations during the last four fiscal years as we have reacted to the significantly weakened market for new homes for the year ended september 30 2010 we closed 20875 homes with an average closing sales price of approximately 206100 

 

through our financial services operations we provide mortgage financing and title agency services to homebuyers in many of our homebuilding markets dhi mortgage our whollyowned subsidiary provides mortgage financing services principally to the purchasers of homes we build we generally do not retain or service the mortgages we originate but rather seek to sell the mortgages and related servicing rights to thirdparty purchasers dhi mortgage originates loans in accordance with purchaser guidelines and historically has sold substantially all of its mortgage production within 30 days of origination our subsidiary title companies serve as title insurance agents by providing title insurance policies examination and closing services primarily to the purchasers of our homes 

 

our financial reporting segments consist of six homebuilding segments and a financial services segment our homebuilding operations are the most substantial part of our business comprising approximately 98 of consolidated revenues which totaled 44 billion in fiscal 2010 our homebuilding operations generate most of their revenues from the sale of completed homes with a lesser amount from the sale of land and lots in addition to building traditional singlefamily detached homes we also build attached homes such as town homes duplexes triplexes and condominiums including some midrise buildings which share common walls and roofs the sale of detached homes generated approximately 86 81 and 77 of home sales revenues in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively our financial services segment generates its revenues from originating and selling mortgages and collecting fees for title insurance agency and closing services

operating strategy and structure 

 

for a substantial part of our company’s existence we maintained significant yearoveryear growth and profitability we achieved this growth through an operating strategy focused on capturing greater market share while also maintaining a strong balance sheet to execute our strategy we invested available capital in our existing homebuilding markets and opportunistically entered new markets we also actively evaluated homebuilding acquisition opportunities as they arose some of which resulted in acquisitions and contributed to our growth 

 

during the past four years conditions in the homebuilding industry have been challenging although we believe the longterm fundamental factors that support housing demand remain positive it is not possible to predict when current conditions will improve or if they will deteriorate from current levels during the current downturn we have increased our cash balances by generating substantial cash flow from operations primarily through reductions in inventory and mortgage loans held for sale the receipt of tax refunds and by accessing the capital markets while we will continue to conservatively manage our business our increased liquidity provides us with flexibility in determining the appropriate operating strategy for each of our communities and markets to strike the best balance between cash flow generation and potential profit 

 

geographic diversity 

 

from 1978 to late 1987 our homebuilding activities were conducted in the dallasfort worth area we then began diversifying geographically by entering additional markets both through startup operations and acquisitions we now operate in 26 states and 72 markets this provides us with geographic diversification in our homebuilding inventory investments and our sources of revenues and earnings we believe our diversification strategy helps to mitigate the effects of local and regional economic cycles and enhances our longterm potential 

 

economies of scale 

 

we are the largest homebuilding company in the united states in terms of number of homes closed in fiscal 2010 by the same measure we are also one of the five largest builders in many of our markets in fiscal 2010 we believe that our national regional and local scale of operations has provided us with benefits that may not be available in the same degree to some other smaller homebuilders such as 

 

  

decentralized operations 

 

we decentralize our homebuilding activities to give operating flexibility to our local division presidents on certain key operating decisions at september 30 2010 we had 33 separate homebuilding operating divisions many of which operate in more than one market area generally each operating division consists of a division president land entitlement acquisition and development personnel a sales manager and sales personnel a construction manager and construction superintendents customer service personnel a controller a purchasing manager and office staff we believe that division presidents and their management teams who are familiar with local conditions generally have better information on which to base decisions regarding their operations our division presidents receive performance bonuses based upon achieving targeted financial and operational measures in their operating divisions 

operating division responsibilities 

 

each operating division is responsible for 

 

  

— a feasibility study 

 

— soil and environmental reviews 

 

— review of existing zoning and other governmental requirements and 

 

— review of the need for and extent of offsite work required to meet local building codes 

 

  

centralized controls 

 

we centralize the key risk elements of our homebuilding business through our regional and corporate offices we have four separate homebuilding regional offices generally each regional office consists of a region president legal counsel a chief financial officer a purchasing manager and limited office support staff each of our region presidents and their management teams are responsible for oversight of the operations of up to eleven homebuilding operating divisions including 

 

  

our corporate executives and corporate office departments are responsible for establishing our operational policies and internal control standards and for monitoring compliance with established policies and controls throughout our operations the corporate office also has primary responsibility for direct management of certain key risk elements and initiatives through the following centralized functions 

 

 3 

 

  

cost management 

 

we control overhead costs by centralizing certain administrative and accounting functions and by closely monitoring the number of administrative personnel and management positions in our operating divisions as well as in our regional and corporate offices we also seek to efficiently manage our advertising costs by directing many of our promotional activities toward local real estate brokers 

 

we control construction costs by striving to design our homes efficiently and by obtaining competitive bids for construction materials and labor we also seek to negotiate favorable pricing from our primary subcontractors and suppliers based on the volume of services and products we purchase from them on a local regional and national basis we monitor our construction costs on each house as well as our inventory levels margins returns and expenses through our management information systems 

 

acquisitions 

 

as negative market conditions in the housing industry persist we remain committed to maintaining our strong balance sheet and liquidity position however we will continue to evaluate opportunities for strategic acquisitions or expansions of our operations we believe that the current housing industry downturn may provide us selected opportunities to enhance our operations through the acquisition of existing homebuilding companies or distressed real estate properties at attractive valuations in certain instances such acquisitions can provide us benefits not found in startup operations such as established land positions and inventories and existing relationships with municipalities land owners developers subcontractors and suppliers we seek to limit the risks associated with acquiring other companies and distressed real estate properties by conducting extensive operational financial and legal due diligence on each acquisition and by performing financial analysis to determine that each acquisition will have a positive impact on our earnings within an acceptable period of time 

markets 

 

we conduct our homebuilding operations in all of the geographic regions states and markets listed below and we conduct our mortgage and title operations in many of these markets our homebuilding operating divisions are aggregated into six reporting segments also referred to as reporting regions which comprise the markets below our financial statements contain additional information regarding segment performance 

 

 

 

when evaluating new or existing homebuilding markets for purposes of capital allocation we consider local marketspecific factors including among others 

 

  

land policies 

 

we acquire land after we have completed due diligence and generally after we have obtained the rights known as entitlements to begin development or construction work resulting in an acceptable number of residential lots before we acquire lots or tracts of land we will among other things complete a feasibility study which includes soil tests independent environmental studies and other engineering work and evaluate the status of necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements required to develop and use the property for home construction although we purchase and develop land primarily to support our homebuilding activities we also sell land and lots to other developers and homebuilders where we have excess land and lot positions 

 

we also enter into landlot option contracts in which we obtain the right but generally not the obligation to buy land or lots at predetermined prices on a defined schedule commensurate with anticipated home closings or planned land development our option contracts generally are nonrecourse which limits our financial exposure to our earnest money deposited with land and lot sellers and any preacquisition due diligence costs incurred by us this enables us to control land and lot positions with limited capital investment which substantially reduces the risks associated with land ownership and development 

 

almost all of our land and lot positions are acquired directly by us we have avoided entering into joint venture arrangements due to their increased costs and complexity as well as the loss of operational control inherent in such arrangements we are a party to a very small number of joint ventures that were acquired through acquisitions of other homebuilders all of these joint ventures are consolidated in our financial statements 

 

we attempt to mitigate our exposure to real estate inventory risks by 

 

 6 

 

  

the benefits of this strategy have been limited by the sustained weak conditions in the homebuilding industry over the past four fiscal years 

 

construction 

 

our home designs are selected or prepared in each of our markets to appeal to local tastes and preferences of homebuyers in each community we also offer optional interior and exterior features to allow homebuyers to enhance the basic home design and to allow us to generate additional revenues from each home sold we have adjusted our product offerings to address affordability issues which have become increasingly important in the current weak market conditions 

 

substantially all of our construction work is performed by subcontractors subcontractors typically are retained for a specific subdivision pursuant to a contract that obligates the subcontractor to complete construction at an agreedupon price agreements with the subcontractors and suppliers we use generally are negotiated for each subdivision we compete with other homebuilders for qualified subcontractors raw materials and lots in the markets where we operate we employ construction superintendents to monitor homes under construction participate in major design and building decisions coordinate the activities of subcontractors and suppliers review the work of subcontractors for quality and cost controls and monitor compliance with zoning and building codes in addition our construction superintendents play a significant role in working with our homebuyers by assisting with option selection and home modification decisions educating buyers on the construction process and instructing buyers on postclosing home maintenance 

 

construction time for our homes depends on the weather availability of labor materials and supplies size of the home and other factors we typically complete the construction of a home within three to six months 

 

we typically do not maintain significant inventories of construction materials except for work in progress materials for homes under construction generally the construction materials used in our operations are readily available from numerous sources we have contracts exceeding one year with certain suppliers of our building materials that are cancelable at our option with a 30 day notice in recent years we have not experienced delays in construction due to shortages of materials or labor that have materially affected our consolidated operating results 

 

marketing and sales 

 

we market and sell our homes through commissioned employees and independent real estate brokers we typically conduct home sales from sales offices located in furnished model homes in each subdivision and we typically do not offer our model homes for sale until the completion of a subdivision our sales personnel assist prospective homebuyers by providing them with floor plans price information tours of model homes and assisting them with the selection of options and other custom features we train and inform our sales personnel as to the availability of financing construction schedules and marketing and advertising plans as our customers are typically firsttime or moveup homebuyers we attempt to adjust our product mix and pricing within our homebuilding markets to keep our homes affordable as market conditions warrant we may provide potential homebuyers with one or more of a variety of incentives including discounts and free upgrades to be competitive in a particular market due to the weak industry conditions of the past four fiscal years we have offered an increased level of incentives to homebuyers 

 

we advertise in our local markets as necessary through newspapers marketing brochures newsletters and email or other electronic means to prospective homebuyers and real estate brokers we also use billboards radio and television advertising and our internet website to market the location price range and availability of 

our homes to minimize advertising costs we attempt to operate in subdivisions in conspicuous locations that permit us to take advantage of local traffic patterns we also believe that model homes play a substantial role in our marketing efforts so we expend significant effort to create an attractive atmosphere in our model homes 

 

in addition to using model homes we build a limited number of speculative homes in each subdivision these homes enhance our marketing and sales efforts to prospective homebuyers who are relocating to these markets as well as to independent brokers who often represent homebuyers requiring a completed home within a short time frame we determine our speculative homes strategy in each market based on local market factors such as new job growth the number of job relocations housing demand and supply seasonality current sales contract cancellation trends and our past experience in the market we determine the number of speculative homes to build in each subdivision based on our current and planned sales pace and we monitor and adjust speculative home inventory on an ongoing basis as conditions warrant the significant weakness in our housing markets and related high cancellation rates during recent years had caused our speculative home inventory to remain higher than our target levels during fiscal 2010 we were able to reduce both total and speculative homes in inventory from the prior year levels we expect to maintain a level of speculative home inventory in our markets that will be based on our expectations of future sales and closings volume we believe these speculative homes help to provide us with opportunities to sell additional homes at a profit reduce our inventory of owned lots and generate positive cash flows 

 

our sales contracts require an earnest money deposit of at least 500 the amount of earnest money required varies between markets and subdivisions and may significantly exceed 500 additionally customers are generally required to pay additional deposits when they select options or upgrade features for their homes most of our sales contracts stipulate that when customers cancel their contracts with us we have the right to retain their earnest money and option deposits however our operating divisions occasionally choose to refund such deposits our sales contracts also include a financing contingency which permits customers to cancel and receive a refund of their deposits if they cannot obtain mortgage financing at prevailing or specified interest rates within a specified period our contracts may include other contingencies such as the sale of an existing home as a percentage of gross sales orders cancellations of sales contracts in fiscal 2010 were 26 compared to 30 in fiscal 2009 while this reflects an improvement from the prior year our cancellation rate continues to be significantly higher than our historical rate before the current downturn in the homebuilding industry reflecting the continuing weak housing market conditions the length of time between the signing of a sales contract for a home and delivery of the home to the buyer closing is generally from two to six months

our operating divisions are responsible for preclosing quality control inspections and responding to customers’ postclosing needs we believe that a prompt and courteous response to homebuyers’ needs during and after construction reduces postclosing repair costs enhances our reputation for quality and service and ultimately leads to significant repeat and referral business from the real estate community and homebuyers we typically provide our homebuyers with a tenyear limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems a twoyear limited warranty on major mechanical systems and a oneyear limited warranty on other construction components the subcontractors who perform the actual construction also provide us with warranties on workmanship and are generally prepared to respond to us and the homeowner promptly upon request in addition some of our suppliers provide manufacturer’s warranties on specified products installed in the home 

 

sales order backlog 

 

at september 30 2010 the value of our backlog of sales orders was 8508 million 4128 homes a decrease of 25 from 11420 million 5628 homes at september 30 2009 the average sales price of homes in backlog was 206100 at september 30 2010 up 2 from the 202900 average at september 30 2009 sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies including mortgage loan approval and 

buyers selling their existing homes which can result in cancellations a portion of the contracts in backlog will not result in closings due to cancellations substantially all of the homes in our sales backlog at september 30 2010 are scheduled to close in fiscal year 2011 further discussion of our backlog is provided in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

 

customer mortgage financing 

 

we provide mortgage financing services principally to purchasers of our homes in the majority of our homebuilding markets through our whollyowned subsidiary dhi mortgage dhi mortgage coordinates and expedites the sales transaction by ensuring that mortgage commitments are received and that closings take place in a timely and efficient manner dhi mortgage originates mortgage loans for a substantial portion of our homebuyers and when necessary to fulfill the needs of some homebuyers also brokers loans to thirdparty lenders who directly originate the mortgage loans during the year ended september 30 2010 approximately 90 of dhi mortgage’s loan volume related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations and dhi mortgage provided mortgage financing services for approximately 61 of our total homes closed 

 

to limit the risks associated with our mortgage operations dhi mortgage only originates loan products that it believes may be sold to thirdparty purchasers dhi mortgage generally sells the loans and their servicing rights to thirdparty purchasers shortly after origination with limited recourse provisions in markets where we currently do not provide mortgage financing we work with a variety of mortgage lenders that make available to homebuyers a range of mortgage financing programs 

 

title services 

 

through our subsidiary title companies we serve as a title insurance agent in selected markets by providing title insurance policies examination and closing services to the purchasers of homes we build and sell we currently assume little or no underwriting risk associated with these title policies 

 

employees 

 

at september 30 2010 we employed 3214 persons of whom 860 were sales and marketing personnel 1001 were executive administrative and clerical personnel 678 were involved in construction and 675 worked in mortgage and title operations we had fewer than 10 employees covered by collective bargaining agreements employees of some of the subcontractors that we use are represented by labor unions or are subject to collective bargaining agreements we believe that our relations with our employees and subcontractors are good 

 

competition 

 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive we compete in each of our markets with numerous other national regional and local homebuilders for homebuyers desirable properties raw materials skilled labor and financing we also compete with resales of existing homes and with the rental housing market our homes compete on the basis of quality price design mortgage financing terms and location in the current weak housing market competition among homebuilders has greatly intensified especially as to pricing and incentives as builders attempt to maximize sales volume despite the weak housing demand the current market conditions have also led to a large number of foreclosed homes being offered for sale which has increased competition for homebuyers and affected pricing our financial services business competes with other mortgage lenders including national regional and local mortgage bankers and other financial institutions some of which have greater access to capital different lending criteria and potentially broader product offerings 

 

governmental regulation and environmental matters 

 

the homebuilding industry is subject to extensive and complex regulations we and the subcontractors we use must comply with various federal state and local laws and regulations including zoning density and 

development requirements building environmental advertising and real estate sales rules and regulations these regulations and requirements affect the development process as well as building materials to be used building designs and minimum elevation of properties our homes are inspected by local authorities where required and homes eligible for insurance or guarantees provided by the federal housing administration fha and the veterans administration va are subject to inspection by them these regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities in addition our new housing developments may be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets and other public improvements 

 

our homebuilding operations are also subject to a variety of local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning protection of health safety and the environment the particular environmental laws for each site vary greatly according to location environmental condition and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties 

 

our mortgage company and title insurance agencies must also comply with various federal and state laws and regulations these include eligibility and other requirements for participation in the programs offered by the fha va government national mortgage association gnma federal national mortgage association fannie mae and federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac these also include required compliance with consumer lending and other laws and regulations such as disclosure requirements prohibitions against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures all of these laws and regulations may subject our operations to examination by the applicable agencies 

 

seasonality 

 

we have typically experienced seasonal variations in our quarterly operating results and capital requirements prior to the current downturn in the homebuilding industry we generally had more homes under construction closed more homes and had greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year this seasonal activity increased our working capital requirements for our homebuilding operations during the third and fourth fiscal quarters and increased our funding requirements for the mortgages we originated in our financial services segment at the end of these quarters as a result of seasonal activity our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year 

 

in contrast to our typical seasonal results the weakness in homebuilding market conditions during the past four years has mitigated our historical seasonal variations also in fiscal 2010 the expiration of the federal homebuyer tax credit impacted the timing of our construction activities home sales and closing volumes although we may experience our typical historical seasonal pattern in the future given the current market conditions we can make no assurances as to when or whether this pattern will recur

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

discussion of our business and operations included in this annual report on form 10k should be read together with the risk factors set forth below they describe various risks and uncertainties we are or may become subject to many of which are difficult to predict or beyond our control these risks and uncertainties together with other factors described elsewhere in this report have the potential to affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner 

 

the homebuilding industry is undergoing a significant downturn and its duration and ultimate severity are uncertain continued weakness or further deterioration in industry conditions or in the broader economic conditions could have additional adverse effects on our business and financial results 

 

the downturn in the homebuilding industry is in its fourth year and it has become one of the most severe housing downturns in us history the significant declines in the demand for new homes oversupply of homes on the market and reductions in the availability of financing for homebuyers that have marked the downturn are continuing during the downturn we have experienced material reductions in our home sales and homebuilding revenues and we have incurred material inventory and goodwill impairments and other writeoffs 

our ability to respond to the downturn has been limited by adverse industry and economic conditions the significant number of home mortgage foreclosures has increased supply and driven down prices making the purchase of a foreclosed home an attractive alternative to purchasing a new home homebuilders have responded to declining sales and increased cancellation rates with significant concessions further adding to the price declines with the decline in the values of homes and the inability of some homeowners to make their mortgage payments the credit markets have been significantly disrupted putting strains on many households and businesses in the face of these conditions the overall economy has remained very weak with high unemployment levels and substantially reduced consumer spending and confidence as a result demand for new homes remains at historically low levels 

 

these challenging conditions are complex and interrelated we cannot predict their duration or ultimate severity nor can we provide assurance that our responses to the homebuilding downturn or the government’s attempts to address the troubles in the overall economy will be successful 

 

constriction of the credit markets could limit our ability to access capital and increase our costs of capital 

 

during the downturn in the homebuilding industry we have relied principally on our positive operating cash flow to meet our working capital needs and repay outstanding indebtedness we generated substantial operating cash flow during this time however the downturn and the constriction of the credit markets have reduced the other sources of liquidity available to us while the public debt markets are currently accessible today at historically favorable rates there were periods during the downturn where accessing the public debt markets would have increased our cost of capital 

 

in may 2009 we voluntarily terminated our 165 billion unsecured revolving credit facility we have since relied on shortterm arrangements with some of the former lenders under the terminated facility for the letters of credit we require in our business a new line of credit should we decide to pursue one may be difficult to obtain on favorable terms in the current circumstances of our business and the overall economy it would also likely involve additional financing costs and restrictions on our business our not having a line in place could reduce our flexibility in responding to or taking advantage of changing conditions in the homebuilding industry or require us to use our own cash resources in doing so 

 

our mortgage subsidiary dhi mortgage uses a 100 million mortgage repurchase facility to finance many of the loans it originates the facility must be renewed annually and the current facility expires in march 2011 a continuation of current market conditions could make the renewal more difficult or could result in an increase in the cost of the facility or a decrease in its committed availability such conditions may also make it more difficult or costly to sell the mortgages that we originate 

 

as of september 30 2010 we had 2964 million of debt maturing in the next 12 months we believe we can meet these and our other capital requirements with our existing cash resources and future cash flows and if required other sources of financing that we anticipate will be available to us however we can provide no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so particularly if current industry or economic conditions continue or deteriorate further the future effects on our business liquidity and financial results of these conditions could be material and adverse both in ways described above and in other ways that we do not currently foresee 

 

we use letters of credit and surety bonds to secure our performance under various construction and land development agreements escrow agreements financial guarantees and other arrangements should our future performance or economic conditions make these more difficult to obtain or more costly our business or financial results could be adversely affected 

 

the reduction in availability of mortgage financing has adversely affected our business and the duration and ultimate severity of the effects are uncertain 

 

over the last four fiscal years the mortgage lending industry has experienced significant change and contraction credit requirements have tightened and investor demand for mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities has been limited to securities backed by fannie mae freddie mac or ginnie mae this has made it 

more difficult for many buyers to finance the purchase of our homes thus reducing the pool of qualified homebuyers these reductions in demand have adversely affected our business and financial results and the duration and severity of these effects remain uncertain 

 

we believe that the liquidity provided by fannie mae freddie mac and ginnie mae to the mortgage industry has been very important to the housing market fannie mae and freddie mac have required substantial injections of capital from the federal government and may require additional government support in the future in addition increased lending volume and losses insured by the fha have resulted in a reduction of its cash reserves any reduction in the availability of the financing provided by these institutions could adversely affect interest rates mortgage availability and sales of new homes and mortgage loans 

 

the fha insures mortgage loans that generally have lower loan payment requirements and as a result continue to be a particularly important source for financing the sale of our homes in the last two years more restrictive guidelines have been placed on fha insured loans affecting minimum down payment and availability for condominium financing in the near future further restrictions are expected on fha insured loans including but not limited to limitations on sellerpaid closing costs and concessions this or any other restriction may negatively affect the availability or affordability of fha financing which could adversely affect our ability to sell homes 

 

while the use of down payment assistance programs by our homebuyers has decreased significantly some of our customers still utilize 100 financing through programs offered by the va and united states department of agriculture usda there can be no assurance that these programs or other programs will continue to be available or will be as attractive to our customers as the programs currently offered which could negatively affect our sales 

 

even if potential customers do not need financing changes in the availability of mortgage products may make it more difficult for them to sell their current homes to potential buyers who need financing 

 

mortgage rates are currently at historically low levels if interest rates increase the costs of owning a home will be affected and could result in further reductions in the demand for our homes 

 

our strategies in responding to the adverse conditions in the homebuilding industry have had limited success and the continued implementation of these and other strategies may not be successful 

 

while we have been successful in generating positive operating cash flow and reducing our inventories in the last four fiscal years we have done so at reduced revenue and gross profit levels and have incurred significant asset impairment charges resulting in pretax losses also during this time notwithstanding our sales strategies we continued to experience an elevated rate of sales contract cancellations we believe that the increase in the cancellation rate is largely due to reduced homebuyer confidence due principally to the weak economy and the continuing high level of unemployment a more restrictive mortgage lending environment and the inability of some buyers to sell their existing homes have also impacted cancellations many of these factors which affect new sales and cancellation rates are beyond our control it is uncertain how long the reduction in sales and the increased level of cancellations will continue if these conditions continue for a protracted period it is not clear whether our strategies will succeed in maintaining or increasing our sales volume or our current margins 

 

our business and financial results could be adversely affected by significant inflation or deflation 

 

inflation can adversely affect us by increasing costs of land materials and labor in the event of a return of inflation we may seek to increase the sales prices of homes in order to maintain satisfactory margins however a continuation of the oversupply of homes relative to demand may make this difficult in addition significant inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates which have a negative impact on housing demand in such an environment we may not be able to raise home prices sufficiently to keep up with the rate of inflation and our margins could decrease moreover with inflation the costs of capital increase and the purchasing power of our cash resources can decline current or future efforts by the government to stimulate 

the economy may increase the risk of significant inflation and its adverse impact on our business or financial results 

 

alternatively a significant period of deflation could cause a decrease in overall spending and borrowing levels this could lead to a further deterioration in economic conditions including an increase in the rate of unemployment deflation could also cause the value of our inventories to decline or reduce the value of existing homes below the related mortgage loan balance which could potentially increase the supply of existing homes and have a negative impact on our results of operations 

 

the homebuilding industry is cyclical and affected by changes in general economic real estate or other business conditions that could adversely affect our business or financial results 

 

the homebuilding industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in industry conditions as well as changes in general and local economic conditions such as 

 

  

these may occur on a national scale like the current downturn or may affect some of our regions or markets more than others when adverse conditions affect any of our larger markets they could have a proportionately greater impact on us than on some other homebuilding companies our operations in previously strong markets particularly california florida nevada and arizona have more adversely affected our financial results than our other markets in the current downturn 

 

an oversupply of alternatives to new homes including foreclosed homes homes held for sale by investors and speculators other existing homes and rental properties can also reduce our ability to sell new homes depress new home prices and reduce our margins on the sales of new homes high levels of foreclosures not only contribute to additional inventory available for sale but also reduce appraisal valuations for new homes and the amount that can be financed potentially resulting in lower sales prices 

 

weather conditions and natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes wildfires volcanic activity droughts and floods can harm our homebuilding business these can delay home closings adversely affect the cost or availability of materials or labor or damage homes under construction the climates and geology of many of the states in which we operate including california florida and texas where we have some of our larger operations present increased risks of adverse weather or natural disasters 

 

continued military deployments in the middle east and other overseas regions terrorist attacks other acts of violence or threats to national security and any corresponding response by the united states or others or related domestic or international instability may adversely affect general economic conditions or cause a slowdown of the economy 

 

as a result of the foregoing matters potential customers may be less willing or able to buy our homes because of current industry and economic conditions we have not been able to increase the sale prices of our homes in the future our pricing strategies may also be limited by market conditions we may be unable to further change the mix of our home offerings reduce the costs of the homes we build or offer more affordable homes to maintain our margins or satisfactorily address changing market conditions in other ways in addition cancellations of home sales contracts in backlog may increase as homebuyers choose to not honor their contracts due to any of the factors discussed above 

our financial services business is closely related to our homebuilding business as it originates mortgage loans principally to purchasers of the homes we build a decrease in the demand for our homes because of the foregoing matters may also adversely affect the financial results of this segment of our business an increase in the default rate on the mortgages we originate may adversely affect our ability to sell the mortgages or the pricing we receive upon the sale of mortgages or may increase our repurchase or other obligations for previous originations we establish reserves related to mortgages we have sold however actual future obligations related to these mortgages could differ significantly from our currently estimated amounts 

 

the risks associated with our land and lot inventory could adversely affect our business or financial results 

 

inventory risks are substantial for our homebuilding business the risks inherent in controlling or purchasing and developing land increase as consumer demand for housing decreases thus we may have acquired options on or bought and developed land or lots at a cost we will not be able to recover fully or on which we cannot build and sell homes profitably as a result our deposits for building lots controlled under option or similar contracts may be put at risk the value of our owned undeveloped land building lots and housing inventories can also fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions in addition inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in reduced margins or losses in a poorly performing community or market during the current economic downturn we have sold homes and land for lower margins or at a loss and we have recorded significant inventory impairment charges 

 

our goals for years of supply for ownership and control of land and building lots are based on management’s expectations for future volume growth in light of the much weaker market conditions encountered since fiscal 2006 we have significantly slowed our purchases of undeveloped land and our development spending on land we own we made substantial land and lot sales in fiscal 2008 throughout the downturn we also terminated numerous land option contracts and wrote off earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs related to these option contracts because future market conditions are uncertain we cannot provide assurance that these measures will be successful in managing our future inventory risks 

 

supply shortages and other risks related to demand for building materials and skilled labor could increase our costs and delay deliveries 

 

the homebuilding industry has from time to time experienced significant difficulties that can affect the cost or timing of construction including 

 

  

these factors may cause us to take longer or incur more costs to build our homes and adversely affect our revenues and margins 

 

increases in the costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business or financial results 

 

significant expenses of owning a home including mortgage interest and real estate taxes generally are deductible expenses for an individual’s federal and in some cases state income taxes subject to various limitations under current tax law and policy if the federal government or a state government changes its income tax laws as has been discussed from time to time to eliminate or substantially modify these income tax deductions the aftertax cost of owning a new home would increase for many of our potential customers 

the loss or reduction of homeowner tax deductions if such tax law changes were enacted without offsetting provisions would adversely impact demand for and sales prices of new homes 

 

in addition increases in property tax rates by local governmental authorities as experienced in response to reduced federal and state funding can adversely affect the ability of potential customers to obtain financing or their desire to purchase new homes 

 

governmental regulations could increase the cost and limit the availability of our development and homebuilding projects and adversely affect our business or financial results 

 

we are subject to extensive and complex regulations that affect land development and home construction including zoning density restrictions building design and building standards these regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities as to the conditions we must meet prior to development or construction being approved if approved at all we are subject to determinations by these authorities as to the adequacy of water or sewage facilities roads or other local services new housing developments may also be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets and other public improvements in addition in many markets government authorities have implemented no growth or growth control initiatives any of these can limit delay or increase the costs of development or home construction 

 

we are also subject to a variety of local state and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of health safety and the environment the impact of environmental laws varies depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available these matters may result in delays may cause us to incur substantial compliance remediation mitigation and other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas 

 

governmental regulation of our financial services operations could adversely affect our business or financial results 

 

our financial services operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations these include eligibility requirements for participation in federal loan programs compliance with consumer lending and similar requirements such as disclosure requirements prohibitions against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures they may also subject our operations to examination by the applicable agencies these factors may limit our ability to provide mortgage financing or title services to potential purchasers of our homes 

 

in july 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act hr4173 was signed into law this legislation provides for a number of new requirements relating to residential mortgage lending practices many of which are to be developed further by implementing rules these include among others minimum standards for mortgages and lender practices in making mortgages limitations on certain fees retention of credit risk prohibition of certain tying arrangements and remedies for borrowers in foreclosure proceedings the effect of such provisions on our financial services business will depend on the rules that are ultimately enacted 

 

the turmoil caused by the increasing number of defaults and resulting foreclosures has encouraged consumer lawsuits and the investigation of financial services industry practices by governmental authorities these investigations could include the examination of consumer lending practices sales of mortgages to financial institutions and other investors and current foreclosure processes or other practices in the financial services segments of homebuilding companies we are unable to assess whether these governmental inquiries will result in changes in regulations homebuilding industry practices or adversely affect the costs and potential profitability of homebuilding companies 

homebuilding is subject to home warranty and construction defect claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant 

 

as a homebuilder we are subject to home warranty and construction defect claims arising in the ordinary course of business as a consequence we maintain product liability insurance obtain indemnities and certificates of insurance from subcontractors generally covering claims related to workmanship and materials we establish warranty and other reserves for the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built because of the uncertainties inherent to these matters we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will be adequate to address all of our warranty and construction defect claims in the future contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce we may be responsible for applicable selfinsured retentions and some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits additionally the coverage offered by and the availability of product liability insurance for construction defects is currently limited and costly we have responded to increases in insurance costs and coverage limitations in recent years by increasing our selfinsured retentions and claim reserves there can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted or become more costly 

 

our substantial debt could adversely affect our financial condition 

 

we have a significant amount of debt as of september 30 2010 our consolidated debt was 21718 million as of september 30 2010 the scheduled maturities of principal on our outstanding debt for the subsequent 12 months totaled 2964 million the indentures governing our senior and convertible senior notes do not restrict the incurrence of future unsecured debt and they permit significant amounts of secured debt we do not currently have a revolving credit facility for our homebuilding operations if we choose to enter into a new line of credit agreement it may limit the amount of debt we could incur 

 

possible consequences the amount and the maturities of our debt could have important consequences for example they could 

 

  

in addition the magnitude of our debt and the restrictions imposed by the instruments governing these obligations expose us to additional risks including 

 

dependence on future performance our ability to meet our debt service and other obligations will depend in part upon our future financial performance our future results are subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report these have been compounded by the current industry and economic conditions our revenues and earnings vary with the level of general economic activity in the markets we serve our businesses are also affected by financial political business and other factors many of which are beyond our control the factors that affect our ability to generate cash can also affect our ability to raise additional funds for these purposes through the sale of debt or equity the refinancing of debt or the sale of assets 

 

mortgage repurchase facility and other restrictions the mortgage repurchase facility for our financial services subsidiaries requires the maintenance of a minimum level of tangible net worth a maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and a minimum level of liquidity by our financial services subsidiaries a failure to comply with these requirements could allow the lending bank to terminate the availability of funds to the financial services subsidiaries or cause their debt to become due and payable prior 

to maturity any difficulty experienced in complying with these covenants could make the renewal of the facility more difficult or costly 

 

in addition although our financial services business is conducted through subsidiaries that are not restricted by our indentures the ability of our financial services subsidiaries to provide funds to our homebuilding operations is subject to restrictions in their mortgage repurchase facility these funds would not be available to us upon the occurrence and during the continuance of defaults under this facility moreover our right to receive assets from these subsidiaries upon their liquidation or recapitalization will be subject to the prior claims of the creditors of these subsidiaries any claims we may have to funds from this segment would be subordinate to subsidiary indebtedness to the extent of any security for such indebtedness and to any indebtedness otherwise recognized as senior to our claims 

 

the indentures governing our senior notes impose restrictions on the creation of secured debt and liens 

 

changes in debt ratings in fiscal 2008 all three of the agencies that rate our senior unsecured debt lowered our ratings to a level below investment grade and these agencies have since lowered our ratings further any additional lowering of our debt ratings could make entering into a new line of credit agreement or accessing the public capital markets more difficult andor more expensive 

 

change of control purchase options if a change of control occurs as defined in the indentures governing 5878 million principal amount of our senior notes as of september 30 2010 we would be required to offer to purchase these notes at 101 of their principal amount together with all accrued and unpaid interest if any if a fundamental change including a change of control occurs as defined in the indenture governing our convertible senior notes which constituted 500 million principal amount as of september 30 2010 we would be required to offer to purchase these notes at par together with all accrued and unpaid interest if any if purchase offers were required under the indentures for these notes we can give no assurance that we would have sufficient funds to pay the amounts that we would be required to purchase 

 

potential future restrictions as a result of terminating our revolving credit facility we are no longer subject to the restrictions on our operations and activities that it imposed on us however if we decide to enter into another revolving credit agreement it is likely that we will again become subject to these types of provisions which may be more restrictive than those found in our previous facility 

 

homebuilding and financial services are very competitive industries and competitive conditions could adversely affect our business or financial results 

 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive homebuilders compete not only for homebuyers but also for desirable properties financing raw materials and skilled labor we compete with other local regional and national homebuilders often within larger subdivisions designed planned and developed by such homebuilders we also compete with existing home sales foreclosures and rental properties the competitive conditions in the homebuilding industry can result in 

 

  

our financial services business competes with other mortgage lenders including national regional and local mortgage banks and other financial institutions mortgage lenders with greater access to capital or different lending criteria may be able to offer more attractive financing to potential customers 

these competitive conditions could adversely affect our business and financial results in the current downturn in the homebuilding industry the reactions of our competitors may have reduced the effectiveness of our efforts to achieve pricing stability and reduce our inventory levels 

 

we cannot make any assurances that any future growth strategies will be successful or not expose us to additional risks 

 

although we focused on internal growth for several years before the downturn in the homebuilding industry we may in the future make strategic acquisitions of homebuilding companies or their assets successful strategic acquisitions require the integration of operations and management although we believe that we have been successful in the past we can give no assurance that we would be able to successfully identify acquire and integrate strategic acquisitions in the future acquisitions can result in the dilution of existing stockholders if we issue our common stock as consideration or reduce our liquidity or increase our debt if we fund them with cash the impact on liquidity may be increased because we do not currently have a revolving credit facility in addition acquisitions can expose us to valuation risks including the risk of writing off goodwill or impairing inventory and other assets related to such acquisitions the risk of goodwill and other asset impairments increases during a cyclical housing downturn when our profitability may decline as evidenced by the goodwill and other asset impairment charges we recognized in recent years in addition we may not be able to successfully implement our operating or internal growth strategies within our existing markets in the uncertain current market conditions asset acquisitions involve a risk that the markets involved may subsequently deteriorate conversely if we delay an acquisition until we believe the market uncertainties are resolved the potential competitive advantages of the acquisition may be limited 

 

we may not realize our deferred income tax asset 

 

as of september 30 2010 we have a net deferred income tax asset of 9026 million against which we have provided a valuation allowance of 9026 million the realization of our deferred income tax asset is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the statutory carryforward periods in which the related temporary differences become deductible 

 

the accounting for deferred income taxes is based upon estimates of future results differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position changes in tax laws also affect actual tax results and the valuation of deferred income tax assets over time 

 

the utilization of our tax losses could be substantially limited if we experienced an ownership change as defined in the internal revenue code 

 

we have experienced continuing tax net operating losses through fiscal 2010 and have potential unrealized builtin losses these tax net operating losses have the potential to reduce future income tax obligations if we realize taxable income in the future however section 382 of the internal revenue code contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards and certain builtin losses recognized in years after the ownership change under the rules such an ownership change is generally any change in ownership of more than 50 of its stock within a rolling threeyear period as calculated in accordance with the rules the rules generally operate by focusing on changes in ownership among stockholders considered by the rules as owning directly or indirectly 5 or more of the stock of the company and any change in ownership arising from new issuances of stock by the company 

 

if we undergo an ownership change for purposes of section 382 as a result of future transactions involving our common stock both the amount of and our ability to use any of our net operating loss carryforwards tax credit carryforwards or net unrealized builtin losses at the time of ownership change would be subject to the limitations of section 382 in addition these limitations may affect the expiration date of a portion of our builtin losses any net operating loss carryforwards or tax credit carryforwards and we may not 

be able to use them before they expire this could adversely affect our financial position results of operations and cash flow 

 

we do not believe we have experienced such an ownership change as of september 30 2010 however the amount by which our ownership may change in the future is affected by purchases and sales of stock by 5 stockholders the potential conversion of our outstanding convertible senior notes and our decision as to whether to settle any such conversions completely or partially in stock and new issuances of stock by us

results of operations — fiscal year 2010 overview 

 

in fiscal 2010 conditions within the homebuilding industry remained challenging primarily due to weak overall economic conditions high unemployment and low consumer confidence demand for new homes improved while the federal homebuyer tax credit was in effect but decreased sharply once the tax credit expired our net sales orders for fiscal 2010 were 14 higher than in fiscal 2009 however much of the yearoveryear increase was attributable to our results in the first half of the year before the federal homebuyer tax credit expired subsequent to its expiration our net sales orders in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2010 were 3 and 21 lower respectively than in the comparable prior year periods these results suggest that efforts to improve our net sales order volume will be challenging and that overall demand for new homes is likely to remain at very low levels for some time 

 

during the ongoing slowdown in the homebuilding industry that began in 2006 numerous factors have hurt demand for new homes on a pervasive and persistent basis across the united states these factors include high inventory levels of available homes elevated sales order cancellation rates low sales absorption rates and overall weak consumer confidence the effects of these factors have been magnified by reduced availability of credit in the mortgage markets and high levels of home foreclosures high levels of foreclosures not only contribute to additional inventory available for sale but also reduce appraisal valuations for new homes potentially resulting in lower sales prices the overall economy remains weak with a high level of unemployment substantially reduced consumer spending and low levels of consumer confidence the turmoil in the housing market has resulted in substantial price reductions in our homes during the course of the slowdown 

 

in the first half of fiscal 2010 there were indications of some stabilization of housing market conditions the factors supporting the improved conditions included increased levels of affordability resulting from lower home sales prices declines in the number of new homes available for sale a low mortgage interest rate environment and the federal government’s monetary and fiscal policies and programs including the federal homebuyer tax credit which encouraged home ownership and home purchases these market conditions supported our strategy of opening new communities via lot option contracts and starting construction on more unsold homes to provide affordable housing and capture demand from firsttime and moveup homebuyers having additional housing inventory available to close before the expiration of the federal tax credit resulted in significant increases in our net sales orders during the first half of fiscal 2010 from the comparable prior year period during fiscal 2010 our homes closed and our gross profit as a percentage of home sales revenues increased from fiscal 2009 which resulted in pretax income of 995 million in 2010 compared to a pretax loss of 5568 million in 2009 

 

the decline in demand subsequent to the expiration of the tax credit indicates that market conditions in the homebuilding industry are weak and the timing of a sustainable recovery remains uncertain we are maintaining our cautious outlook for the homebuilding industry and will adjust our operating strategy as necessary as we continually assess the level of underlying demand for new homes in our communities however we presently expect that our level of home sales closings and profitability will be lower in fiscal 2011 than fiscal 2010 

 

our future results could be negatively impacted by prolonged weakness in the economy continued high levels of unemployment a significant increase in mortgage interest rates or further tightening of mortgage lending standards 

 

due to these uncertain market conditions we have continued to evaluate our homebuilding and financial services assets for recoverability our assets whose recoverability is most impacted by market conditions include inventory earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs related to land and lot option contracts tax assets and owned mortgage loans these assets collectively represented approximately 89 of our total assets excluding cash and marketable securities at september 30 2010 our evaluations reflected our expectation of continued challenges in the homebuilding industry based on our evaluations during fiscal 2010 we recorded 

inventory impairment charges of 623 million wroteoff earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs related to land and lot option contracts we no longer plan to pursue of 24 million recorded additional reserves for losses of 137 million associated with mortgage loans held in portfolio and the limited recourse provisions on previously sold mortgage loans and increased the reserve related to mortgage reinsurance activities by 19 million inventory impairment charges and writeoffs of earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs declined in fiscal 2010 from prior years reflecting an improvement in gross profit from home closings during fiscal 2010 compared to prior years we will evaluate whether further impairment charges valuation adjustments or writeoffs are necessary on these assets in the coming quarters additional discussion of these evaluations and charges is presented below 

 

strategy 

 

we believe the longterm fundamental factors which support housing demand namely population growth and household formation remain positive in the near term however it is not possible to predict if current homebuilding industry conditions will improve or if they will deteriorate from current levels during the downturn we have increased our cash balances by generating cash flow from operations primarily through reductions in inventory and mortgage loans held for sale the receipt of tax refunds and by accessing the capital markets while we will continue to conservatively manage our business our increased liquidity provides us with flexibility in determining the appropriate operating strategy for each of our communities and markets to strike the best balance between cash flow generation and potential profit with this flexibility we are committed to continuing the following initiatives related to our operating strategy in the current homebuilding business environment 

 

  

these initiatives allowed us to generate significant cash flows from operations during the downturn and to achieve improved operating results during fiscal 2010 although we cannot provide any assurances that these initiatives will be successful in the future we expect that our operating strategy will allow us to continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity position in fiscal 2011

results of operations — homebuilding 

 

our operating segments are our 33 homebuilding operating divisions which we aggregate into six reporting segments these reporting segments which we also refer to as reporting regions have homebuilding operations located in the following states 

 

 

 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 a change in the composition of our operating divisions required that the las cruces new mexico market previously included in our southwest reporting segment now be included in our south central reporting segment consequently throughout this discussion we have restated the prior year amounts between segments to conform to the current year presentation 

 

fiscal year ended september 30 2010 compared to fiscal year ended september 30 2009 

 

the following tables and related discussion set forth key operating and financial data for our homebuilding operations by reporting segment as of and for the fiscal years ended september 30 2010 and 2009

net sales orders 

 

the value of net sales orders increased 15 to 40110 million 19375 homes in 2010 from 34984 million 17034 homes in 2009 the number of net sales orders increased 14 in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 these results were impacted by increased levels of affordability resulting from lower home sales prices recent declines in the number of new homes available for sale a low mortgage interest rate environment and the federal government’s monetary and fiscal policies and programs including the federal homebuyer tax credit which accelerated sales demand during the first half of the year although these results reflect improvement over the prior year and suggest the severe declines in our net sales orders experienced in recent years may be moderating the significant decline in demand subsequent to the expiration of the federal tax credit indicates that market conditions are weak and the timing of a sustainable housing recovery remains uncertain 

 

in comparing fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2009 the value of net sales orders increased in most of our market regions with the largest percentage increases occurring in our east southeast and south central regions resulting from new communities in the carolinas florida and texas as well as lower cancellation rates achieved in these regions conversely our midwest region experienced a 13 decline in net sales orders due to continued weak demand in our chicago market fluctuations in the value of net sales orders were primarily due to the change in the number of homes sold in each respective region and to a much lesser extent small fluctuations in the average selling price of those homes our sales volumes in the future will depend on the strength of the overall economy employment levels and our ability to successfully implement our operating strategies in each of our markets 

 

the average price of our net sales orders in 2010 was 207000 an increase of 1 from the 205400 average in 2009 we will continue our efforts to offer affordable product offerings to our target customer base and will seek to adjust our product mix geographic mix and pricing within our homebuilding markets to meet market conditions 

 

our annual sales order cancellation rate cancelled sales orders divided by gross sales orders for the period was 26 in fiscal 2010 compared to 30 in fiscal 2009 this cancellation rate continues to be above historical levels our ability to reduce it to historical levels depends largely on the strength of the overall economy and our ability to successfully implement our operating strategies in each of our markets we anticipate that cancellation rates will continue to fluctuate significantly until there is sustained stability in market conditions 

 

 

 

sales order backlog 

 

sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies including mortgage loan approval and buyers selling their existing homes which can result in cancellations a portion of the contracts in backlog will not result in closings due to cancellations which during the recent housing downturn have been substantial 

 

our homes in backlog at september 30 2010 declined 27 from the prior year as a result of closing homes at a greater rate than our sales pace during the latter half of the year and the effects of the federal homebuyer tax credit that was in effect at september 30 2009 given our lower level of backlog at the beginning of fiscal 2011 as compared to the level at the beginning of fiscal 2010 we expect that our 2011 first quarter closings and revenues will be lower than in the prior year additionally should the sales trends of the second half of fiscal 2010 continue into the first half of fiscal 2011 our full year closings and revenues will likely be lower in 2011 than 2010 

 

 

 

home sales revenue 

 

revenues from home sales increased 21 to 43023 million 20875 homes closed in 2010 from 35636 million 16703 homes closed in 2009 the average selling price of homes closed during 2010 was 206100 down 3 from the 213400 average in 2009 during fiscal 2010 home sales revenues increased in most of our market regions with significant increases in our east southeast and south central markets these increases resulted from increases in the number of homes closed 

 

the number of homes closed in 2010 increased 25 due to increases in five of our six market regions the increase in home closings reflects the impact of the firsttime homebuyer’s federal tax credit which initially required buyers to close on their home purchase transaction by june 30 2010 we believe this helped stimulate demand for homes that could close during the first nine months of fiscal 2010 we also believe that our operating strategy of selectively starting construction on unsold homes which made additional housing inventory available to close by june 30 2010 led to increased home closings volume by better capturing this demand the southwest region had an 8 decrease in homes closed due to both weak demand in the phoenix market and our prior year efforts to reduce completed home inventories in that market as conditions change in the housing markets in which we operate our ongoing level of net sales orders will determine the number of home closings and amount of revenue we will generate 

homebuilding operating margin analysis 

 

 

 

home sales gross profit 

 

gross profit from home sales increased by 59 to 7440 million in 2010 from 4675 million in 2009 and as a percentage of home sales revenues increased 420 basis points to 173 approximately 350 basis points of the increase in the home sales gross profit percentage was a result of the average cost of our homes declining by more than our average selling prices caused largely by a reduction in our construction costs on homes closed during the current year the reduction in construction costs primarily results from changes in product design as well as cost reductions obtained from our suppliers and subcontractors in prior periods in addition the increase in home sales gross profit is partially due to our efforts beginning in fiscal 2009 to acquire lot positions in new communities and construct and close houses from these new projects homes closed on these recently acquired finished lots yielded higher gross profits than those on land and lots acquired in prior years approximately 70 basis points of the increase was due to a decrease in the amortization of capitalized interest and property taxes as a percentage of homes sales revenues resulting from reductions in our interest and property taxes incurred over the past year as well as more closings occurring on acquired finished lots rather than internally developed lots 

 

future changes in gross profit percentages are impacted by the use of sales incentives and price adjustments to generate an adequate volume of home closings we expect our gross profit percentage to decline in the first half of fiscal 2011 due to current weak housing market conditions 

 

land sales revenue 

 

land sales revenues decreased 82 to 74 million in 2010 from 403 million in 2009 of the 403 million of revenues in fiscal 2009 269 million related to land sale transactions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 for which recognition of the revenue had been deferred due to the terms of the sale fluctuations in revenues from land sales are a function of how we manage our inventory levels in various markets we generally purchase land and lots with the intent to build and sell homes on them however we occasionally purchase land that includes commercially zoned parcels which we typically sell to commercial developers and we also sell residential lots or land parcels to manage our land and lot supply land and lot sales occur at unpredictable intervals and varying degrees of profitability therefore the revenues and gross profit from land sales fluctuate from period to period as of september 30 2010 we had 33 million of land held for sale that we expect to sell in the next twelve months

inventory impairments and land option cost writeoffs 

 

during fiscal 2010 when we performed our quarterly inventory impairment analyses the assumptions utilized reflected our expectation of continued challenging conditions and uncertainties in the homebuilding industry and in our markets as we continue to evaluate the strength of the economy measured largely in terms of job growth the level of underlying demand for new homes and our operating performance the level of impairments in future quarters will likely fluctuate and may increase our impairment evaluation as of september 30 2010 indicated communities with a combined carrying value of 4098 million had indicators of potential impairment and these communities were evaluated for impairment the analysis of the large majority of these communities assumed that sales prices in future periods will be equal to or lower than current sales order prices in each community or in comparable communities in order to generate an acceptable absorption rate for a minority of communities that we do not intend to develop or operate in current market conditions slight increases over current sales prices were assumed while it is difficult to determine a timeframe for a given community in the current market conditions we estimated the remaining lives of these communities to range from six months to in excess of ten years in performing this analysis we utilized a range of discount rates for communities of 14 to 20 through this evaluation process we determined that communities with a carrying value of 631 million as of september 30 2010 were impaired as a result during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 we recorded impairment charges of 291 million to reduce the carrying value of the impaired communities to their estimated fair value as compared to 1749 million in the same period of the prior year the fourth quarter charges combined with impairment charges recorded earlier in the year resulted in total inventory impairment charges of 623 million and 3778 million during fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively 

 

we perform our impairment analysis based on total inventory at the community level when an impairment charge for a community is determined the charge is then allocated to each lot in the community in the same manner as land and development costs are allocated to each lot the inventory within each community is categorized as construction in progress and finished homes residential land and lots developed and under development and land held for development based on the stage of production or plans for future development during fiscal 2010 approximately 93 of the impairment charges were recorded to residential land and lots and land held for development and approximately 7 of the charges were recorded to construction in progress and finished homes inventory compared to 85 and 15 respectively in fiscal 2009 

 

of the remaining 3467 million carrying value of communities with impairment indicators which were determined not to be impaired at september 30 2010 the largest concentrations were in california 22 illinois 17 arizona 10 texas 9 florida 9 and new jersey 8 it is possible that our estimate of undiscounted cash flows from these communities may change and could result in a future need to record impairment charges to adjust the carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair value there are several factors which could lead to changes in the estimates of undiscounted future cash flows for a given community the most significant of these include pricing and incentive levels actually realized by the community the rate at which the homes are sold and the costs incurred to develop the lots and construct the homes the pricing and incentive levels are often interrelated with sales pace within a community such that a price reduction can be expected to increase the sales pace further both of these factors are heavily influenced by the competitive pressures facing a given community from both new homes and existing homes some of which may result from foreclosures if conditions worsen in the broader economy homebuilding industry or specific markets in which we operate and as we reevaluate specific community pricing and incentives construction and development plans and our overall land sale strategies we may be required to evaluate additional communities or reevaluate previously impaired communities for potential impairment these evaluations may result in additional impairment charges 

 

based on our quarterly reviews of land and lot option contracts we have written off earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs related to contracts for land or lots which are not expected to be acquired during fiscal 2010 and 2009 we wrote off 24 million and 299 million respectively of earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs related to land option contracts at september 30 2010 outstanding earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs associated with our portfolio of land and lot option purchase contracts totaled 133 million and 110 million respectively 

the inventory impairment charges and writeoffs of earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs reduced total homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding revenues by approximately 150 basis points in fiscal 2010 compared to 1130 basis points in fiscal 2009 

 

selling general and administrative sga expense 

 

sga expense from homebuilding activities decreased slightly to 5220 million in 2010 from 5230 million in 2009 as a percentage of homebuilding revenues sga expense decreased 240 basis points to 121 in 2010 from 145 in 2009 the largest component of our homebuilding sga expense is employee compensation and related costs which represented 58 and 55 of sga costs in 2010 and 2009 respectively these costs increased by 6 to 3040 million in 2010 from 2872 million in 2009 our homebuilding operations employed approximately 2500 and 2300 employees at september 30 2010 and 2009 respectively 

 

a portion of compensation expense relates to our longterm incentive bonus program which provides for the compensation committee of our board of directors to award performance units to our chairman of the board and our chief executive officer the actual number of performance units earned is based upon our level of achievement on defined performance metrics as compared to our peer group the earned award will have a value equal to the number of earned units multiplied by the closing price of our common stock at the end of the performance period and may be paid in cash equity or a combination of both the compensation committee has the discretion to reduce the final payout on the performance units from the amount earned performance units were granted in 2008 and 2009 with 33month performance periods ending on september 30 2010 and 2011 respectively our liability for these awards has been based on our performance against the peer group the elapsed portion of the performance period and our stock price as of each reporting date and previously assumed no future reduction of the earned value of the performance units by the compensation committee because the values of the earned performance units are dependent on our performance and our common stock price and because the final amount can be reduced at the discretion of the compensation committee this liability has been subject to a high degree of volatility 

 

subsequent to september 30 2010 the compensation committee exercised its discretion and reduced the amount earned under the 2008 performance unit grant to 49 million and expects to limit the amount which may be earned under the 2009 performance unit grant to approximately 41 million the liability related to the 2008 and 2009 performance unit grants was 90 million and 113 million at september 30 2010 and september 30 2009 respectively compensation expense benefit related to these grants were 23 million and 77 million for fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively 

 

we continually attempt to adjust our sga infrastructure to support our expected closings volume however we cannot make assurances that our actions will permit us to maintain or improve upon the current sga expense as a percentage of revenues it has become more difficult to reduce sga expense as the size of our operations has decreased if revenues decrease and we are unable to sufficiently adjust our sga future sga expense as a percentage of revenues will increase 

 

interest incurred 

 

we capitalize homebuilding interest costs to inventory during active development and construction due to the decrease in the size of our operations our inventory under active development and construction has been lower than our debt level therefore a portion of our interest incurred must be expensed we expensed 863 million of homebuilding interest during fiscal 2010 compared to 1002 million of interest during fiscal 2009 

 

interest amortized to cost of sales excluding interest written off with inventory impairment charges was 34 of total home and landlot cost of sales in 2010 compared to 39 in 2009 interest incurred is related to the average level of our homebuilding debt outstanding during the period comparing fiscal 2010 with fiscal 2009 interest incurred related to homebuilding debt decreased 16 to 1732 million primarily due to a 19 decrease in our average homebuilding debt 

gainloss on early retirement of debt 

 

we retired 8222 million principal amount of our senior and senior subordinated notes prior to their maturity during fiscal 2010 compared to 3803 million in fiscal 2009 related to the early retirement of these notes we recognized a net loss of 49 million in fiscal 2010 and a net gain of 115 million in fiscal 2009 which represents the difference between the principal amount of the notes and the aggregate purchase price less any unamortized discounts and fees the loss in fiscal 2010 includes a loss of 20 million for the call premium related to the early redemption of our 5875 senior notes due 2013 the gain in fiscal 2009 was partially offset by a 76 million loss related to the early termination of our revolving credit facility in may 2009 

 

other income 

 

other income net of other expenses associated with homebuilding activities was 92 million in 2010 compared to 128 million in 2009 the largest component of other income in both years was interest income 

 

goodwill 

 

in performing our annual goodwill impairment analysis we estimate the fair value of our operating segments utilizing the present values of expected future cash flows as a result of the analysis performed as of september 30 2010 and 2009 we determined that the fair value of our operating segments was greater than their carrying value and therefore no impairment of goodwill existed as of september 30 2010 and 2009 our goodwill balance was 159 million all of which related to our south central reporting segment the goodwill assessment procedures require management to make comprehensive estimates of future revenues and costs due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates actual results could differ from these estimates 

 

homebuilding results by reporting region 

 

 

 

 

  

east region  — homebuilding revenues increased 42 in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase in the number of homes closed with the largest increases occurring in our new jersey and carolina markets the region reported a loss before income taxes of 63 million in 2010 compared to a loss of 959 million in 2009 the results were due in part to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs totaling 86 million and 649 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively the region’s gross profit from home sales as a percentage of home sales revenue home sales gross profit percentage increased 390 basis points in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 the increase was a result of a 

reduction in the construction costs of our homes closed during fiscal 2010 also a reduction in the region’s sga expenses as a percentage of homebuilding revenues contributed 420 basis points to the region’s improvement in loss before income taxes as a percentage of homebuilding revenues as the region’s additional closing volume helped leverage these sga expenses 

 

midwest region  — homebuilding revenues increased 5 in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to increases in the number of homes closed in all of the region’s markets the region reported a loss before income taxes of 313 million in 2010 compared to a loss of 1049 million in 2009 the results were due in part to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs totaling 220 million and 547 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively the region’s home sales gross profit percentage increased 920 basis points in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 the increase was a result of higher margins primarily in our chicago and denver markets the denver market also benefitted from lower warranty costs on previously closed homes in fiscal 2010 a reduction in the region’s sga expenses as a percentage of homebuilding revenues contributed 280 basis points to the region’s improvement in loss before income taxes as a percentage of homebuilding revenues although these results reflect improvement over the prior year we experienced a significant decline in net sales orders in this region during recent quarters this decline was due to continued weak demand in our chicago market and we expect conditions in this market to remain challenging in the nearterm substantially all of our fiscal 2010 impairments for this region related to projects in our chicago market 

 

southeast region  — homebuilding revenues increased 31 in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase in the number of homes closed with the largest increases occurring in our central florida and atlanta markets the region reported a loss before income taxes of 75 million in fiscal 2010 compared to a loss of 732 million in fiscal 2009 the results were due in part to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs totaling 175 million and 380 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively the region’s home sales gross profit percentage increased 460 basis points in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 the increase was a result of higher margins on homes closed in the majority of the region’s markets led by our south and central florida markets the increase in homes sales gross profit percentage was a result of construction costs declining at a faster rate than the decline in average selling price on homes closed during fiscal 2010 also contributing to the increase in home sales gross profit are our efforts since the beginning of fiscal 2009 to acquire lot positions in new communities and construct and close houses from these new projects homes closed on these recently acquired finished lots are generally yielding higher gross profits than those on land and lots acquired in prior years in fiscal 2010 a reduction in the region’s sga expenses as a percentage of homebuilding revenues contributed 250 basis points to the region’s improvement in income before income taxes as a percentage of homebuilding revenues as the region’s additional closing volume helped leverage these sga expenses 

 

south central region  — homebuilding revenues increased 35 in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase in the number of homes closed with the largest increases occurring in our central texas houston and dallasfort worth markets the region reported income before income taxes of 834 million in fiscal 2010 compared to income of 49 million in fiscal 2009 the improvement was due in large part to the increase in revenue combined with the region’s home sales gross profit percentage increasing 290 basis points in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 due to higher margins on homes closed in the majority of the region’s markets these higher margins were primarily attributable to reductions in construction costs of our homes additionally a decrease in inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs which were 140 million in fiscal 2010 compared to 200 million in fiscal 2009 contributed to the region’s increase in income before income taxes 

 

southwest region  — homebuilding revenues decreased 14 in 2010 compared to 2009 due to a decrease in the number of homes closed and in the average selling price of those homes the decreases in revenues and homes closed were due to continuing weakness in the phoenix market the region reported income before income taxes of 120 million in 2010 compared to a loss before income taxes of 458 million in 2009 the loss in 2009 was due in large part to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs totaling 394 million the region’s home sales gross profit percentage increased 330 basis points in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 the increase was a result of the average cost of the region’s homes 

declining by more than the average selling prices driven in large part by reductions in home construction costs in addition the increase in home sales gross profit is partially due to our recent efforts to acquire lot positions in new communities and construct and close houses from these projects in fiscal 2010 a reduction in the region’s sga expenses both in absolute terms and as a percentage of homebuilding revenues also contributed to the improvement in income before income taxes 

 

west region  — homebuilding revenues increased 6 in 2010 compared to 2009 due to an increase in the number of homes closed which was partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price of those homes the largest increases in homes closed occurred in our seattle and southern california markets the region reported income before income taxes of 278 million in 2010 compared to a loss before income taxes of 2264 million in 2009 the loss in 2009 was due in large part to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs totaling 1907 million compared to 20 million in 2010 the region’s home sales gross profit percentage increased 400 basis points in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 the increase was a result of higher margins on homes closed in the majority of the region’s markets driven in large part by reductions in home construction costs in fiscal 2010 a reduction in the region’s sga expenses as a percentage of homebuilding revenues contributed 260 basis points to the region’s improvement in income before income taxes as a percentage of homebuilding revenues as a result of absolute reductions in sga expenses as well as the additional revenue providing more leverage against these costs 

 

land and lot position and homes in inventory 

 

the following is a summary of our land and lot position and homes in inventory at september 30 2010 and 2009 

 

 

 

 

  

at september 30 2010 we owned or controlled approximately 119400 lots compared to approximately 108700 lots at september 30 2009 of the 119400 total lots we controlled approximately 29700 lots 25 which have a total remaining purchase price of approximately 9639 million through land and lot option purchase contracts with a total of 133 million in earnest money deposits at september 30 2010 approximately 22800 of our owned lots were finished 

 

we had a total of approximately 9500 homes in inventory including approximately 1200 model homes at september 30 2010 compared to approximately 11600 homes in inventory including approximately 1100 model homes at september 30 2009 of our total homes in inventory approximately 5200 and 5800 were unsold at september 30 2010 and 2009 respectively at september 30 2010 approximately 3200 of our unsold homes were completed of which approximately 800 homes had been completed for more than six 

months at september 30 2009 approximately 2200 of our unsold homes were completed of which approximately 800 homes had been completed for more than six months 

 

our current strategy is to take advantage of market opportunities by entering into new lot option contracts to purchase finished lots in selected communities to potentially increase sales volumes and profitability we will attempt to renegotiate existing lot option contracts as necessary to reduce our lot costs and better match the scheduled lot purchases with new home demand in each community we also manage our inventory of homes under construction by selectively starting construction on unsold homes to capture new home demand while monitoring the number and aging of unsold homes and aggressively marketing our unsold completed homes in inventory 

 

fiscal year ended september 30 2009 compared to fiscal year ended september 30 2008 

 

the following tables set forth key operating and financial data for our homebuilding operations by reporting segment as of and for the fiscal years ended september 30 2009 and 2008 we have restated the 2009 and 2008 amounts between reporting segments to conform to the current year presentation reflecting the change in our reporting segments that occurred in fiscal 2010 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

net sales orders 

 

the value of net sales orders decreased 25 to 34984 million 17034 homes in 2009 from 46772 million 21251 homes in 2008 the number of net sales orders decreased 20 in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 factors that contributed to the slowing of demand for new homes in most of our 

markets included a high level of homes for sale which included foreclosed homes for sale a decrease in the availability of mortgage financing for many potential homebuyers the continued uncertainty in the financial markets and a decline in homebuyer consumer confidence however these factors led to lower home prices and improved affordability which combined with various homebuyer tax incentives and low mortgage interest rates served to partially offset some of the market softness 

 

in comparing fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2008 the value of net sales orders decreased in all of our market regions in most market regions these decreases were due to a decrease in the number of homes sold in the respective regions and to a lesser extent to a decline in the average selling price of those homes in the east and southeast regions where decreases in the number of homes sold were not as large as other regions the decline in average selling price was a greater contributor to the decrease in the value of net sales orders 

 

the average price of our net sales orders decreased 7 to 205400 in 2009 from 220100 in 2008 the average price of our net sales orders decreased in five of our six market regions due primarily to price reductions and increased incentives implemented to attempt to achieve an appropriate sales absorption pace as the inventory of existing homes for sale which included a substantial number of foreclosed homes continued to be high we adjusted our pricing to remain competitive with comparable existing home sales prices we also adjusted our product mix geographic mix and pricing within our homebuilding markets in an effort to keep our core product offerings affordable for our target customer base typically firsttime and moveup homebuyers which also contributed to the decrease in average selling price 

 

our annual sales order cancellation rate was 30 in fiscal 2009 compared to 40 in fiscal 2008 while an improvement from the prior year this elevated cancellation rate reflects the challenges in most of our homebuilding markets including the inability of many prospective homebuyers to sell their existing homes the erosion of buyer confidence and the tight credit conditions in the mortgage markets 

 

in july 2008 the “american housing rescue and foreclosure prevention act of 2008” was enacted into law among other provisions this law eliminated sellerfunded down payment assistance on fha insured loans approved on or after october 1 2008 of our total home closings in fiscal 2008 approximately 25 were funded with mortgage loans whereby the homebuyer used a sellerfinanced down payment assistance program while we sought other down payment assistance and mortgage financing alternatives for our buyers the elimination of the sellerfinanced down payment assistance programs had a negative impact on our sales and revenues in fiscal 2009 relative to fiscal 2008 

 

in february 2009 the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 was enacted into law this legislation included a federal tax credit for qualified firsttime homebuyers purchasing a principal residence on or after january 1 2009 and before december 1 2009 in november 2009 this credit was expanded to be available to more homebuyers and extended until june 2010 

 

 

 

sales order backlog 

 

at september 30 2009 the value of our backlog of sales orders was 11420 million 5628 homes a decrease of 5 from 12074 million 5297 homes at september 30 2008 the average sales price of homes 

in backlog was 202900 at september 30 2009 down 11 from the 227900 average at september 30 2008 the yearoveryear increase in home sales activity in the fourth quarter contributed to modest increases in the value of our sales order backlog in four of our six market regions however the value of our backlog decreased significantly in our southwest region particularly in our phoenix market and in our west region particularly in our northern california market 

 

 

 

home sales revenue 

 

revenues from home sales decreased 42 to 35636 million 16703 homes closed in 2009 from 61643 million 26396 homes closed in 2008 the average selling price of homes closed during 2009 was 213400 down 9 from the 233500 average in 2008 in fiscal 2009 home sales revenues decreased significantly in all of our market regions reflecting the continued weak demand and resulting decline in net sales order volume and pricing experienced during the year the number of homes closed in 2009 decreased 37 due to decreases in all of our market regions 

 

revenues from home sales in fiscal 2009 and 2008 were increased by 31 million and 268 million respectively from changes in deferred profit as of september 30 2009 the balance of deferred profit was 27 million compared to 58 million at september 30 2008 

 

homebuilding operating margin analysis 

 

 

home sales gross profit 

 

gross profit from home sales decreased by 32 to 4675 million in 2009 from 6912 million in 2008 and as a percentage of home sales revenues increased 190 basis points to 131 approximately 230 basis points of the increase in the home sales gross profit percentage was a result of the average cost of our homes declining by more than our average selling prices caused by a greater portion of our closings occurring in our south central region which had experienced more stable housing conditions than our other regions and the effects of prior inventory impairments on homes closed during fiscal 2009 approximately 50 basis points of the increase was due to a decrease in the amortization of capitalized interest and property taxes as a percentage of homes sales revenues resulting from reductions in our interest and property taxes incurred over fiscal 2009 these increases were partially offset by a decrease of 30 basis points due to the recognition of a lesser amount of previously deferred gross profit during fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 and by 60 basis points due to an increase in actual and estimated warranty and construction defect costs the increase in estimated warranty costs was due in part to a fiscal 2009 adjustment to our estimated warranty liability related to estimated costs to remedy homes which we had found to or suspected might contain allegedly defective drywall manufactured in china chinese drywall in two of our markets also we experienced increases in our construction defect claims selfinsured retentions resulting in additional reserves for estimated claims 

 

land sales revenue 

 

land sales revenues decreased 89 to 403 million in 2009 from 3543 million in 2008 of the 403 million of revenues in fiscal 2009 269 million related to land sale transactions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 for which recognition of the revenue had been deferred due to the terms of the sale during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we sold a significant amount of land and lots through numerous transactions to generate cash flows reduce our future carrying costs and land development obligations and lower our inventory supply in certain markets consummating these transactions during fiscal 2008 allowed us to monetize a large portion of our deferred tax assets through a loss carryback to fiscal 2006 resulting in a substantial tax refund

inventory impairments and land option cost writeoffs 

 

during fiscal 2009 when we performed our quarterly inventory impairment analyses the assumptions utilized reflected our cautious outlook for the broader homebuilding industry and our markets both of which impact our business this outlook incorporated our belief that housing market conditions might continue to deteriorate and that challenging conditions would persist our impairment evaluation as of september 30 2009 occurred after the end of the springsummer selling season and was based on our latest operating plans for our projects into fiscal 2010 and reflected the anticipated expiration of government support efforts for the homebuilding industry such as the tax credit and fed purchases of mortgagebacked securities in the subsequent year accordingly our impairment evaluation as of september 30 2009 again indicated a significant number of communities with impairment indicators communities with a combined carrying value of 9631 million as of september 30 2009 had indicators of potential impairment and were evaluated for impairment through this evaluation process we determined that communities with a carrying value of 4213 million as of september 30 2009 the largest portion of which was in the west region were impaired as a result during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we recorded impairment charges of 1749 million to reduce the carrying value of the impaired communities to their estimated fair value as compared to 9889 million in the same period of the prior year the fourth quarter charges combined with impairment charges recorded earlier in the year resulted in total inventory impairment charges of 3778 million and 23726 million during fiscal 2009 and 2008 respectively in performing our quarterly inventory impairment analyses during fiscal 2009 we utilized a range of discount rates for communities of 14 to 20 which was increased from the range of 12 to 18 we would have used for these communities in fiscal 2008 the increased discount rates reflected our estimate of the increased level of market risk present in the homebuilding and related mortgage lending industries the impact of the increase in the discount rates on the fourth quarter and fiscal 2009 inventory impairment charges was an increase of 99 million and 189 million respectively during fiscal 2009 approximately 85 of the impairment charges were recorded to residential land and lots and land held for development and approximately 15 of the charges were recorded to construction in progress and finished homes inventory compared to 79 and 21 respectively in fiscal 2008 

 

during fiscal 2009 and 2008 we wrote off 299 million and 1119 million respectively of earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs related to option contracts for land or lots which are not expected to be acquired the inventory impairment charges and writeoffs of earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs reduced total homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding revenues by approximately 1130 basis points in fiscal 2009 compared to 3810 basis points in the fiscal 2008 

 

selling general and administrative sga expense 

 

sga expense from homebuilding activities decreased by 2688 million or 34 to 5230 million in 2009 from 7918 million in 2008 as homebuilding revenues declined at a faster pace than sga expense when expressed as a percentage of homebuilding revenues sga expense increased 240 basis points to 145 in 2009 from 121 in 2008 the largest component of our homebuilding sga expense is employee compensation and related costs which represented 55 and 52 of sga costs in 2009 and 2008 respectively these costs decreased 1257 million or 30 to 2872 million in 2009 from 4129 million in 2008 this decrease was largely due to our efforts to align the number of employees to match our home closing levels as well as a decrease in incentive compensation our homebuilding operations employed approximately 2300 and 3100 employees at september 30 2009 and 2008 respectively most other sga cost components also decreased in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 as a result of our efforts to reduce all costs throughout the company the most substantial decreases occurred in advertising and depreciation 

 

interest incurred 

 

we capitalize homebuilding interest costs to inventory during active development and construction due to our inventory reduction strategies and slowing or suspending land development in certain communities our active inventory during fiscal 2009 and 2008 was lower than our debt level therefore a portion of our interest incurred was expensed we expensed 1002 million of homebuilding interest during fiscal 2009 compared to 390 million of interest during fiscal 2008 since the ratio of our active inventory to debt declined during that period 

interest amortized to cost of sales excluding interest written off with inventory impairment charges was 39 of total home and landlot cost of sales in both 2009 and 2008 interest incurred is related to the average level of our homebuilding debt outstanding during the period comparing fiscal 2009 with fiscal 2008 interest incurred related to homebuilding debt decreased 13 to 2050 million primarily due to a 13 decrease in our average homebuilding debt 

 

gainloss on early retirement of debt 

 

during fiscal 2009 in addition to repaying maturing senior notes we repurchased a total of 3803 million principal amount of various issues of our senior notes prior to their maturity for an aggregate purchase price of 3680 million plus accrued interest we recognized a gain of 115 million related to these repurchases which was partially offset by a loss of 76 million related to the early termination of our revolving credit facility in may 2009 these transactions resulted in a net gain of 39 million during fiscal 2009 

 

the loss on early retirement of debt of 26 million during fiscal 2008 was primarily due to the writeoff of unamortized fees associated with reducing the size of our revolving credit facility in june 2008 

 

other income 

 

other income net of other expenses associated with homebuilding activities was 128 million in 2009 compared to 91 million in 2008 the largest component of other income in both years was interest income 

 

goodwill 

 

in performing our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of september 30 2009 we determined that our goodwill balance of 159 million all of which relates to our south central reporting segment was not impaired as a result of the analysis performed as of september 30 2008 we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 794 million all of which related to our southwest reporting segment 

 

homebuilding results by reporting region 

 

 

 

 

  

east region  — homebuilding revenues decreased 41 in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to a 37 decrease in the number of homes closed with the largest decreases in our new jersey and carolina markets the region reported a loss before income taxes of 959 million in 2009 compared to a loss of 3325 million in 2008 the losses were due in part to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and 

preacquisition cost writeoffs totaling 649 million and 2884 million in fiscal 2009 and 2008 respectively the region’s home sales gross profit percentage increased 390 basis points in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 the increase was a result of the average cost of our homes declining by more than the average selling prices due to the effects of prior inventory impairments on homes closed during 2009 

 

midwest region  — homebuilding revenues decreased 42 in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to a 40 decrease in the number of homes closed with the largest decreases in our denver market the region reported a loss before income taxes of 1049 million in 2009 compared to a loss of 1843 million in 2008 the losses were due in part to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs totaling 547 million and 1633 million in fiscal 2009 and 2008 respectively the region’s home sales gross profit percentage decreased 540 basis points in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 the decrease was a result of lower margins in our chicago and denver markets as well as higher warranty costs on previously closed homes in our denver market additionally our revenues declined at a greater rate than our sga expenses which also contributed to the loss before income taxes in 2009 

 

southeast region  — homebuilding revenues decreased 30 in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to a 20 decrease in the number of homes closed as well as a 12 decrease in the average selling price of those homes the region reported a loss before income taxes of 732 million in 2009 compared to a loss of 5077 million in 2008 the losses were due in part to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs totaling 380 million and 4575 million in fiscal 2009 and 2008 respectively the region’s home sales gross profit percentage increased 340 basis points in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 the increase was a result of the average cost of our homes declining by more than the average selling prices due to the effects of prior inventory impairments on homes closed during 2009 and was partially offset by estimated warranty costs related to homes in one market in florida which we had found to or suspected may contain chinese drywall 

 

south central region  — homebuilding revenues decreased 30 in 2009 compared to 2008 due to a 28 decrease in the number of homes closed the region reported income before income taxes of 49 million in fiscal 2009 compared to a loss before income taxes of 61 million in fiscal 2008 the improvement was due in part to a decrease in inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs which were 200 million and 724 million in fiscal 2009 and 2008 respectively the region’s home sales gross profit percentage increased 40 basis points in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 due to the effects of prior inventory impairments on homes closed during 2009 these improvements were partially offset by our sga expenses decreasing at a slower rate 22 than our homebuilding revenues

mortgage loan activity 

 

the volume of loans originated and brokered by our mortgage operations is directly related to the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations total firstlien loans originated or brokered by dhi mortgage for our homebuyers increased by 14 in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 corresponding to the 25 increase in the number of homes closed the percentage increase in loans originated was lower than the percentage increase in the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations due to a decrease in our mortgage capture rate the percentage of total home closings by our homebuilding operations for which dhi mortgage handled the homebuyers’ financing to 61 in 2010 from 67 in 2009 

 

home closings from our homebuilding operations constituted 90 of dhi mortgage loan originations in 2010 compared to 83 in 2009 reflecting dhi mortgage’s continued focus on supporting the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations the relatively higher captive percentage in the current year reflects a lower level of refinancing activity than in the prior year 

 

the number of loans sold to thirdparty purchasers was virtually the same in 2010 as compared to 2009 while the number of loans originated increased by 5 loans are typically sold within 30 days of origination fluctuations in the volume of loans sold for a given period may not correspond to the change in loan origination volume because of the timing of loan sales which for any quarter generally represents the loans originated in the last month of the prior quarter plus the first two months of the current quarter virtually all of the mortgage loans originated during fiscal 2010 and mortgage loans held for sale on september 30 2010 were eligible for sale to fannie mae freddie mac or gnma “agencyeligible” approximately 86 of the mortgage loans sold by dhi mortgage during fiscal 2010 were sold to two major financial institutions pursuant to their loan purchase agreements with dhi mortgage if we are unable to sell our mortgages to these or other purchasers our ability to originate and sell mortgage loans could be significantly reduced and the profitability of our financial services operations would be negatively impacted 

 

financial services revenues and expenses 

 

revenues from the financial services segment increased 69 to 905 million in 2010 from 537 million in 2009 loan origination fees decreased 5 to 177 million in 2010 from 186 million in 2009 while the number of loans originated increased 5 during the same period the decrease in loan origination fees during 2010 relates to the adoption of the financial accounting standards board’s fasb authoritative guidance for fair value measurements of certain financial instruments on october 1 2008 the authoritative guidance requires net origination costs and fees associated with mortgage loans to be recognized at origination and no longer deferred until the time of sale therefore during fiscal 2009 we recognized 24 million of loan origination fees and 50 million of general and administrative ga costs related to prior period loan originations revenues from the sale of servicing rights and gains from sale of mortgages increased 5 to 596 million in 2010 from 568 million in 2009 charges related to recourse obligations were 137 million in fiscal 2010 compared to 332 million in fiscal 2009 the calculation of our required repurchase loss reserve is based upon an analysis of repurchase requests received our actual repurchases and losses through the disposition of such loans discussions with our mortgage purchasers and analysis of the mortgages we originated while we believe that we have adequately reserved for losses on known and projected repurchase requests if either actual repurchases or the losses incurred resolving those repurchases exceed our expectations additional recourse expense may be incurred also a subsidiary of ours reinsured a portion of private mortgage insurance written on loans originated by dhi mortgage in prior years charges to increase reserves for expected losses on the reinsured loans were 19 million and 149 million during fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively 

 

financial services ga expense decreased 1 to 772 million in 2010 from 781 million in 2009 but increased 6 when excluding 50 million of compensation costs recognized in fiscal 2009 upon the adoption of the fasb’s authoritative guidance for fair value measurements as discussed above the largest component of our financial services ga expense is employee compensation and related costs which represented 78 and 75 of ga costs in 2010 and 2009 respectively excluding the 50 million adjustment discussed 

above these costs increased 14 to 605 million in 2010 from 533 million in 2009 the increase in the current year relates to an increase in the number of financial services employees to approximately 700 at september 30 2010 from 600 at september 30 2009 to support our increased volume and more stringent mortgage purchaser underwriting guidelines 

 

as a percentage of financial services revenues excluding the effects of recourse and reinsurance expense ga expense decreased to 728 in 2010 from 767 in 2009 the decrease was primarily due to the adoption in 2009 of the fasb’s authoritative guidance for fair value measurements of certain financial instruments as discussed above partially offset by additional costs incurred to support more stringent mortgage purchaser underwriting guidelines fluctuations in financial services ga expense as a percentage of revenues can be expected to occur as some expenses are not directly related to mortgage loan volume or to changes in the amount of revenue earned

mortgage loan activity 

 

total firstlien loans originated or brokered by dhi mortgage for our homebuyers decreased by 31 in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 corresponding to the 37 decrease in the number of homes closed the percentage decrease in loans originated was lower than the percentage decrease in homes closed due to an increase in our mortgage capture rate to 67 in 2009 from 61 in 2008 

 

home closings from our homebuilding operations constituted 83 of dhi mortgage loan originations in 2009 compared to 92 in 2008 reflecting dhi mortgage’s continued focus on supporting the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations the relatively lower captive percentage in 2009 reflects an increase in refinancing activity as existing homeowners took advantage of the decline in mortgage interest rates 

 

the number of loans sold to thirdparty purchasers decreased by 22 in 2009 as compared to 2008 the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the number of mortgage loans originated consistent with fiscal 2008 originations during fiscal 2009 continued to predominantly be agencyeligible in fiscal 2009 approximately 99 of dhi mortgage production and 98 of mortgage loans held for sale on september 30 2009 were agencyeligible 

 

financial services revenues and expenses 

 

revenues from the financial services segment decreased 58 to 537 million in 2009 from 1275 million in 2008 the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the number of mortgage loans originated and sold as well as an increase in recourse expense related to future loan repurchase obligations and increases in the loss reserves for reinsured loans charges related to recourse obligations were 332 million in fiscal 2009 compared to 219 million in fiscal 2008 the increase in recourse expense is a result of increasing our loan loss reserves during fiscal 2009 due to increased expectations for loan repurchases and related losses caused by additional repurchase requests arising under the limited recourse provisions also a subsidiary of ours reinsured a portion of private mortgage insurance written on loans originated by dhi mortgage in prior years charges to increase reserves for expected losses on the reinsured loans were 149 million and 49 million during fiscal 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

additionally revenues during fiscal 2008 included the recognition of an additional 88 million of revenues related to the adoption of the fasb’s authoritative guidance for written loan commitments which was adopted on january 1 2008 the guidance requires that the expected net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of a loan are included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings at the time of commitment the effect of this guidance in fiscal 2009 was a 43 million decrease in revenues 

 

financial services ga expense decreased 22 to 781 million in 2009 from 1001 million in 2008 the largest component of our financial services ga expense is employee compensation and related costs which represented 75 and 71 of ga costs in 2009 and 2008 respectively these costs decreased 18 to 583 million in 2009 from 708 million in 2008 as we have continued to align the number of employees with current and anticipated loan origination and title service levels our financial services operations employed approximately 600 and 700 employees at september 30 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

as a percentage of financial services revenues excluding the effects of recourse and reinsurance expense ga expense increased to 767 in 2009 from 649 in 2008 the increase was primarily due to the reduction in revenue resulting from the decrease in mortgage loan volume during fiscal 2009 as well as higher revenues in the prior year due to the adoption of the authoritative guidance for written loan commitments 

results of operations — consolidated 

 

fiscal year ended september 30 2010 compared to fiscal year ended september 30 2009 

 

income loss before income taxes 

 

income before income taxes for fiscal 2010 was 995 million compared to a loss before income taxes of 5568 million for fiscal 2009 the difference in our operating results for 2010 compared to a year ago is primarily due to increased revenue from the higher volume of homes closed a higher gross profit from home sales revenues and lower inventory impairment charges 

 

income taxes 

 

the benefit from income taxes in fiscal 2010 was 1456 million compared to a benefit of 70 million in 2009 in november 2009 the worker homeownership and business assistance act of 2009 was enacted into law and amended section 172 of the internal revenue code this tax law change allows a net operating loss nol realized in one of our fiscal 2008 2009 or 2010 years to be carried back up to five years previously limited to a twoyear carryback we elected to carry back our fiscal 2009 nol this resulted in a benefit from income taxes of 2083 million during fiscal 2010 which was partially offset by an increase in unrecognized tax benefits and state income tax expense we do not have meaningful effective tax rates in these years because of the valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets 

 

we had income taxes receivable of 160 million and 2931 million at september 30 2010 and 2009 respectively during fiscal 2010 we received income tax refunds totaling 4871 million which resulted from tax losses generated in fiscal 2008 and 2009 the income taxes receivable at september 30 2010 relate to additional federal and state income tax refunds we expect to receive 

 

at september 30 2010 we had a federal nol carryforward of 2858 million that will expire in fiscal 2030 and tax benefits for state nol carryforwards of 835 million that expire beginning at various times depending on the tax jurisdiction from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2030 

 

at september 30 2010 and 2009 we had net deferred income tax assets of 9026 million and 10739 million respectively offset by valuation allowances of 9026 million and 10739 million respectively the future realization of our deferred income tax assets ultimately depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income in our carryforward periods under the tax laws we continue to analyze the positive and negative evidence in determining the expected realization of our deferred income tax assets the accounting for deferred taxes is based upon an estimate of future results differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position changes in existing tax laws also affect actual tax results and the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 

 

the benefits of our nol and tax credit carryforwards as well as our unrealized builtin losses would be reduced or potentially eliminated if we experienced an ownership change as defined by internal revenue code section 382 we do not believe we have experienced such an ownership change as of september 30 2010 however the amount by which our ownership may change in the future is affected by purchases and sales of stock by 5 stockholders the potential conversion of our outstanding convertible senior notes and our decision as to whether to settle any such conversions completely or partially in stock and new issuances of stock by us 

 

unrecognized tax benefits are the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit recognized for accounting purposes the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits which includes interest penalties and the tax benefit relating to the deductibility of interest and state income taxes was 828 million and 240 million as of september 30 2010 and 2009 respectively all tax positions if recognized would affect our effective income tax rate the increase in unrecognized tax benefits resulted in large part from our election to carryback our fiscal 2009 nol to fiscal 2004 and 2005 thereby changing the reserve needed for all years open to further tax assessment including 2004 and 2005 it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months the amount of unrecognized tax benefits may decrease as much as 

592 million as a result of a ruling request filed by us with the internal revenue service irs concerning capitalization of inventory costs if the irs rules favorably on the ruling request our unrecognized tax benefits would be reduced resulting in a benefit from income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations 

 

we classify interest and penalties on income taxes as income tax expense during fiscal 2010 and 2009 we recognized interest and penalties with respect to income taxes of 117 million and 30 million respectively in our consolidated statements of operations and at september 30 2010 and 2009 our total accrued interest and penalties relating to unrecognized income tax benefits was 178 million and 62 million respectively 

 

we are subject to federal income tax and to income tax in multiple states the statute of limitations for our major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for fiscal years 2004 through 2010 we are currently being audited by various states and our federal nol refunds from fiscal 2008 and 2009 are subject to congressional joint committee review 

 

fiscal year ended september 30 2009 compared to fiscal year ended september 30 2008 

 

loss before income taxes 

 

loss before income taxes for fiscal 2009 was 5568 million compared to 26318 million for fiscal 2008 the decrease in our consolidated loss was primarily due to significantly lower inventory impairment charges during fiscal 2009 as well as a decrease in our sga expense these improvements were slightly offset by a decrease in the amount of our home sales gross profit due to a reduction in revenues 

 

income taxes 

 

in fiscal 2009 we recorded a benefit from income taxes of 70 million which relates primarily to adjustments to the tax provision recorded for fiscal year 2008 resulting from the finalization and filing of the tax return for that year in fiscal 2008 we recorded a provision for income taxes of 18 million we do not have meaningful effective tax rates in these years because of losses from operations before taxes the impact of valuation allowances on our net deferred tax assets and impairment of nondeductible goodwill 

 

we had income tax receivables of 2931 million and 6762 million at september 30 2009 and 2008 respectively in december 2008 we received a federal income tax refund of 6217 million with respect to our 2008 year we received 1130 million of the 2931 million receivable in the form of a tax refund during october 2009 a substantial portion of the remaining tax receivable at september 30 2009 was due to the carryback of federal tax losses generated in fiscal 2009 that can be carried back against fiscal 2007 taxable income we also had 111 million of income tax receivables for state operating loss carrybacks at september 30 2009 at september 30 2009 and 2008 we had net deferred tax assets of 10739 million and 11748 million respectively offset by valuation allowances of 10739 million and 9613 million respectively 

 

during fiscal 2009 and 2008 we recognized interest and penalties with respect to income taxes of 30 million and 40 million respectively in our consolidated statements of operations and at september 30 2009 and 2008 our total accrued interest and penalties relating to unrecognized income tax benefits was 62 million and 49 million respectively as of september 30 2009 and 2008 our total unrecognized income tax benefits were 240 million and 187 million respectively 

 

overview of capital resources and liquidity 

 

we have historically funded our homebuilding and financial services operations with cash flows from operating activities borrowings under our bank credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities during the challenging homebuilding market conditions experienced over the past few years we have been operating with a primary focus to generate cash flows through reductions in assets as well as through profitable operations our cash generation has also benefitted from income tax refunds the generation of cash flow has allowed us to increase our liquidity and strengthen our balance sheet and has placed us in a position to be able to invest in market opportunities as they arise we do not expect to generate as much cash from asset 

reductions in fiscal 2011 as we have in any of the past four fiscal years depending upon future homebuilding market conditions and our expectations for these conditions we may use a portion of our cash balances to increase our operating assets we intend to maintain adequate liquidity and balance sheet strength and we will continue to evaluate opportunities to access the capital markets as they become available 

 

at september 30 2010 our ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital was 161 a decrease of 1640 basis points from 325 at september 30 2009 net homebuilding debt to total capital consists of homebuilding notes payable net of cash and marketable securities divided by total capital net of cash and marketable securities homebuilding notes payable net of cash and marketable securities plus total equity the decrease in our ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital at september 30 2010 as compared to the ratio a year earlier was primarily due to our lower debt balance resulting from redemptions and repurchases of senior and senior subordinated notes income tax refunds and net income for the year our ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital remains well within our target operating range of below 45 we believe that our strong balance sheet and liquidity position will allow us to be flexible in reacting to changing market conditions however future periodend net homebuilding debt to total capital ratios may be higher than the 161 ratio achieved at september 30 2010 

 

we believe that the ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital is useful in understanding the leverage employed in our homebuilding operations and comparing us with other homebuilders we exclude the debt of our financial services business because it is separately capitalized and its obligation under its repurchase agreement is substantially collateralized and not guaranteed by our parent company or any of our homebuilding entities because of its capital function we include our homebuilding cash and marketable securities as a reduction of our homebuilding debt and total capital for comparison to our ratios of net homebuilding debt to capital above our ratios of homebuilding debt to total capital without netting cash and marketable securities balances were 443 and 562 at september 30 2010 and 2009 respectively 

 

we believe that we will be able to fund our nearterm working capital needs and debt obligations from existing cash resources and our mortgage repurchase facility for our longerterm capital requirements we will evaluate the need to issue new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets or obtain additional bank financing as market conditions may permit 

 

homebuilding capital resources 

 

cash and cash equivalents  — at september 30 2010 we had available homebuilding cash and cash equivalents of 13 billion 

 

marketable securities  — at september 30 2010 we had marketable securities of 2977 million our marketable securities consist of us treasury securities government agency securities foreign government securities corporate debt securities and certificates of deposit 

 

secured letter of credit agreements  — concurrent with the termination of our revolving credit facility in may 2009 we entered into secured letter of credit agreements with the three banks that had issued letters of credit under the facility the effect of these agreements was to remove the outstanding letters of credit from the facility which required us to deposit cash in an amount approximating the balance of letters of credit outstanding as collateral with the issuing banks during fiscal 2010 we entered into secured letter of credit agreements with two additional banks which also require the deposit of cash as collateral at september 30 2010 and 2009 the amount of cash restricted for this purpose totaled 526 million and 533 million respectively and is included in homebuilding restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheets 

 

public unsecured debt  — the indentures governing our senior notes impose restrictions on the creation of secured debt and liens at september 30 2010 we were in compliance with all of the limitations and restrictions that form a part of the public debt obligations 

 

shelf registration statement  — we have an effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec in september 2009 registering debt and equity securities which we may issue from time to time in amounts to be determined 

financial services capital resources 

 

cash and cash equivalents  — at september 30 2010 the amount of financial services cash and cash equivalents was 267 million 

 

mortgage repurchase facility  — our mortgage subsidiary entered into a mortgage sale and repurchase agreement the “mortgage repurchase facility” on march 28 2008 the mortgage repurchase facility which is accounted for as a secured financing provides financing and liquidity to dhi mortgage by facilitating purchase transactions in which dhi mortgage transfers eligible loans to the counterparties against the transfer of funds by the counterparties thereby becoming purchased loans dhi mortgage then has the right and obligation to repurchase the purchased loans upon their sale to thirdparty purchasers in the secondary market or within specified time frames from 45 to 120 days in accordance with the terms of the mortgage repurchase facility the capacity of the facility is 100 million with a provision allowing an increase in the capacity to 125 million during the last five business days of any fiscal quarter and the first seven business days of the following fiscal quarter the maturity date of the facility is march 4 2011 

 

as of september 30 2010 2369 million of mortgage loans held for sale were pledged under the repurchase agreement these mortgage loans had a collateral value of 2227 million dhi mortgage has the option to fund a portion of its repurchase obligations in advance as a result of advance paydowns totaling 1362 million dhi mortgage had an obligation of 865 million outstanding under the mortgage repurchase facility at september 30 2010 at a 38 interest rate 

 

the mortgage repurchase facility is not guaranteed by either dr horton inc or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt the facility contains financial covenants as to the mortgage subsidiary’s minimum required tangible net worth its maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and its minimum required liquidity these covenants are measured and reported monthly at september 30 2010 our mortgage subsidiary was in compliance with all of the conditions and covenants of the mortgage repurchase facility 

 

in the past we have been able to renew or extend our mortgage credit facilities on satisfactory terms prior to their maturities and obtain temporary additional commitments through amendments to the credit agreements during periods of higher than normal volumes of mortgages held for sale the liquidity of our financial services business depends upon its continued ability to renew and extend the mortgage repurchase facility or to obtain other additional financing in sufficient capacities 

 

operating cash flow activities 

 

during fiscal 2010 net cash provided by our operating activities was 7094 million compared to 11 billion during fiscal 2009 a significant portion of the net cash provided by our operating activities during these years was due to federal income tax refunds in fiscal 2010 the profit we generated also contributed to operating cash flows in addition during fiscal 2009 and particularly during fiscal 2008 a significant portion of the net cash provided by our operating activities was due to the generation of cash flows through the reduction of our inventories the net cash provided by our operating activities during the past three fiscal years has resulted in substantial liquidity this liquidity gives us the flexibility to determine the appropriate operating strategy for each of our communities and to take advantage of opportunities in the market while we have limited our purchases of undeveloped land and our development spending on land we own we are purchasing or contracting to purchase finished lots in many markets to potentially increase sales and home closing volumes and return to sustainable profitability we plan to continue to manage our inventories by monitoring the number and aging of unsold homes and aggressively marketing our unsold completed homes in inventory as we work toward these goals we expect to generate less cash flow from asset reductions than we have over the past three fiscal years depending upon future homebuilding market conditions and our expectations for these conditions we may use a portion of our cash balances to increase our inventories 

investing cash flow activities 

 

during fiscal 2010 and 2009 net cash used in our investing activities was 3180 million and 594 million respectively in fiscal 2010 we began to invest a portion of our cash on hand in marketable securities and we used 3280 million for this purpose proceeds from the sale of these marketable securities during the year totaled 277 million additionally in fiscal 2010 and 2009 we used 192 million and 62 million respectively to invest in purchases of property and equipment primarily model home furniture and office equipment in fiscal 2009 the increase in restricted cash was due to the initial cash collateralization of our outstanding letters of credit under the terms of our secured letter of credit agreements subsequent changes in restricted cash are primarily due to fluctuations in the balance of our outstanding letters of credit 

 

financing cash flow activities 

 

during the last two years the majority of our shortterm financing needs have been funded with cash generated from operations and borrowings available under our financial services credit facility longterm financing needs of our homebuilding operations have historically been funded with the issuance of senior unsecured debt securities through the public capital markets during fiscal 2010 we repaid a total of 10163 million principal amount of various issues of senior and senior subordinated notes through maturities redemptions and repurchases for an aggregate purchase price of 10182 million plus accrued interest during fiscal 2009 we repaid a total of 8332 million principal amount of various issues of senior notes through maturities and repurchases for an aggregate purchase price of 8210 million plus accrued interest also during fiscal 2009 we issued 500 million principal amount of 2 convertible senior notes due 2014 our homebuilding senior and convertible senior notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our whollyowned subsidiaries other than our financial services subsidiaries and certain insignificant subsidiaries 

 

consistent with dividends paid in fiscal 2009 our board of directors approved four quarterly cash dividends of 00375 per common share during fiscal 2010 the last of these was paid on august 26 2010 to stockholders of record on august 16 2010 on november 11 2010 our board of directors approved a cash dividend of 00375 per common share payable on december 8 2010 to stockholders of record on november 24 2010 the declaration of future cash dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon among other things future earnings cash flows capital requirements our financial condition and general business conditions 

 

changes in capital structure 

 

in november 2009 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 100 million of our common stock and the repurchase of up to 500 million of our debt securities following significant repurchase activity the debt repurchase authorization was renewed in april 2010 and again in july 2010 the current authorization is effective through july 31 2011 at september 30 2010 4838 million of the authorization was remaining 

 

on january 15 2010 we repaid the remaining 1309 million principal amount of our 4875 senior notes which were due on that date on february 24 2010 we redeemed the remaining 950 million principal amount of our 5875 senior notes due 2013 on september 15 2010 we repaid the remaining 519 million principal amount of our 975 senior notes and 113 million principal amount of our 975 senior subordinated notes due on that date additionally during fiscal 2010 we repurchased a total of 7272 million principal amount of various issues of senior notes through unsolicited transactions these repayments of public unsecured debt were made from our cash balance 

 

in october 2010 through an unsolicited transaction we repurchased 83 million principal amount of our 5375 senior notes due 2012 

 

recently our primary nonoperating use of available capital has been to repay debt we continue to evaluate our alternatives for future nonoperating sources and uses of our available capital including debt repayments dividend payments or common stock repurchases while considering the overall level of our cash balances within the constraints of our balance sheet leverage targets and our liquidity targets 

contractual cash obligations commercial commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

our primary contractual cash obligations for our homebuilding and financial services segments are payments under our debt agreements and lease payments under operating leases purchase obligations of our homebuilding segment represent specific performance requirements under lot option purchase agreements that may require us to purchase land contingent upon the land seller meeting certain obligations we expect to fund our contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business through a combination of our existing cash resources cash flows generated from operations renewed or amended mortgage repurchase facilities and if needed or believed advantageous the issuance of new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets as market conditions may permit 

 

our future cash requirements for contractual obligations as of september 30 2010 are presented below 

 

 

 

 

  

at september 30 2010 our homebuilding operations had outstanding letters of credit of 517 million all of which were cash collateralized and surety bonds of 8069 million issued by third parties to secure performance under various contracts we expect that our performance obligations secured by these letters of credit and bonds will generally be completed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms when we complete our performance obligations the related letters of credit and bonds are generally released shortly thereafter leaving us with no continuing obligations we have no material thirdparty guarantees 

 

our mortgage subsidiary enters into various commitments related to the lending activities of our mortgage operations further discussion of these commitments is provided in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” under part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts to procure land or lots for the construction of homes lot option contracts enable us to control significant lot positions with limited capital investment and substantially reduce the risks associated with land ownership and development within the land and lot option purchase contracts at september 30 2010 there were a limited number of contracts representing 57 million of remaining purchase price subject to specific performance clauses which may require us to purchase the land or lots upon the land sellers meeting their obligations also we consolidated certain variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary with 

assets of 76 million related to some of our outstanding land and lot option purchase contracts creditors if any of these variable interest entities have no recourse against us further discussion of our land option contracts is provided in the “land and lot position and homes in inventory” section included herein 

 

seasonality 

 

we have typically experienced seasonal variations in our quarterly operating results and capital requirements prior to the current downturn in the homebuilding industry we generally had more homes under construction closed more homes and had greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year this seasonal activity increased our working capital requirements for our homebuilding operations during the third and fourth fiscal quarters and increased our funding requirements for the mortgages we originated in our financial services segment at the end of these quarters as a result of seasonal activity our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year 

 

in contrast to our typical seasonal results the weakness in homebuilding market conditions during the past four years has mitigated our historical seasonal variations also in fiscal 2010 the expiration of the federal homebuyer tax credit impacted the timing of our construction activities home sales and closing volumes although we may experience our typical historical seasonal pattern in the future given the current market conditions we can make no assurances as to when or whether this pattern will recur 

 

inflation 

 

we and the homebuilding industry in general may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation primarily because of higher land financing labor and material construction costs in addition higher mortgage interest rates can significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers we attempt to pass through to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices however during periods of soft housing market conditions we may not be able to offset our cost increases with higher selling prices 

 

forwardlooking statements 

 

some of the statements contained in this report as well as in other materials we have filed or will file with the sec statements made by us in periodic press releases and oral statements we make to analysts stockholders and the press in the course of presentations about us may be construed as “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 and the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 forwardlooking statements are based on management’s beliefs as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to management these forwardlooking statements typically include the words “anticipate” “believe” “consider” “estimate” “expect” “forecast” “goal” “intend” “objective” “plan” “predict” “projection” “seek” “strategy” “target” “will” or other words of similar meaning any or all of the forwardlooking statements included in this report and in any other of our reports or public statements may not approximate actual experience and the expectations derived from them may not be realized due to risks uncertainties and other factors as a result actual results may differ materially from the expectations or results we discuss in the forwardlooking statements these risks uncertainties and other factors include but are not limited to

we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise however any further disclosures made on related subjects in subsequent reports on forms 10k 10q and 8k should be consulted additional information about issues that could lead to material changes in performance and risk factors that have the potential to affect us is contained in item 1a “risk factors” under part i of this annual report on form 10k 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

general  — a comprehensive enumeration of the significant accounting policies of dr horton inc and subsidiaries is presented in note a to the accompanying financial statements as of september 30 2010 and 2009 and for the years ended september 30 2010 2009 and 2008 each of our accounting policies has been chosen based upon current authoritative literature that collectively comprises us generally accepted accounting principles gaap in instances where alternative methods of accounting are permissible under gaap we have chosen the method that most appropriately reflects the nature of our business the results of our operations and our financial condition and have consistently applied those methods over each of the periods presented in the financial statements the audit committee of our board of directors has reviewed and approved the accounting policies selected 

 

revenue recognition  — we generally recognize homebuilding revenue and related profit at the time of the closing of a sale when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer in situations where the buyer’s financing is originated by dhi mortgage our whollyowned mortgage subsidiary and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment the profit is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a thirdparty purchaser has been completed any profit on land sales is deferred until the full accrual method criteria are met we include proceeds from home closings held for our benefit at title companies in homebuilding cash when we execute sales contracts with our homebuyers or when we require advance payment from homebuyers for custom changes upgrades or options related to their homes we record the cash deposits received as liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are canceled we either retain or refund to the homebuyer deposits on canceled sales contracts depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances 

 

we recognize financial services revenues associated with our title operations as closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued both of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed we transfer substantially all underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies to thirdparty insurers in accordance with the fasb’s authoritative guidance related to the fair value option for financial 

assets we typically elect the fair value option for our mortgage loan originations mortgage loans held for sale are initially recorded at fair value based on either sale commitments or current market quotes and are adjusted for subsequent changes in fair value until the loan is sold the fair value option alleviates the complex documentation required had these instruments been designated as a fair value hedge net origination costs and fees associated with mortgage loans are recognized at the time of origination the expected net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of a loan are included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings at the time of commitment we generally do not retain or service the mortgages that we originate rather we seek to sell the mortgages and related servicing rights to thirdparty purchasers interest income is earned from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold 

 

some mortgage loans are sold with limited recourse provisions based on historical experience discussions with our mortgage purchasers analysis of the mortgages we originated and current housing and credit market conditions we estimate and record a loss reserve for mortgage loans held in portfolio and mortgage loans held for sale as well as known and projected mortgage loan repurchase requests a 20 or 40 increase in the amount of expected mortgage loan repurchases and expected losses on mortgage loan repurchases would result in an increase of approximately 45 million or 97 million respectively in our reserve for expected mortgage loan repurchases 

 

marketable securities  — during fiscal 2010 we began to invest a portion of our cash on hand by purchasing marketable securities with maturities in excess of three months these securities are held in the custody of a single financial institution to be considered for investment securities must meet certain minimum requirements as to their credit ratings time to maturity and other riskrelated criteria as prescribed by our investment policies the primary objective of these investments is the preservation of capital with the secondary objectives of attaining higher yields than we earn on our cash and cash equivalents and maintaining a high degree of liquidity 

 

we consider our investment portfolio to be availableforsale accordingly these investments are recorded at fair value at the end of a reporting period unrealized gains and losses on these investments net of tax are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the consolidated balance sheet 

 

inventories and cost of sales  — inventory includes the costs of direct land acquisition land development and home construction capitalized interest real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and home construction applicable direct overhead costs that we incur after development projects or homes are substantially complete such as utilities maintenance and cleaning are charged to sga expense as incurred all indirect overhead costs such as compensation of sales personnel division and region management and the costs of advertising and builder’s risk insurance are charged to sga expense as incurred 

 

land and development costs are typically allocated to individual residential lots on a prorata basis and the costs of residential lots are transferred to construction in progress when home construction begins we use the specific identification method for the purpose of accumulating home construction costs cost of sales for homes closed includes the specific construction costs of each home and all applicable land acquisition land development and related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each community any changes to the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial home closings in a community are allocated on a prorata basis to the homes in the community benefiting from the relevant development activity which generally relates to the remaining homes in the community 

 

when a home is closed we generally have not yet paid and recorded all incurred costs necessary to complete the home we record as a liability and as a charge to cost of sales the amount we determine will ultimately be paid related to completed homes that have been closed we compare our home construction budgets to actual recorded costs to determine the additional costs remaining to be paid on each closed home we monitor the accuracy of the accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on closed homes in subsequent months to the amount previously accrued although actual costs to be paid in the future on previously closed homes could differ from our current accruals differences in amounts historically have not been significant 

each quarter we review our inventory for the purpose of determining whether recorded costs and any estimated costs required to complete each home or community are recoverable if the review indicates that an impairment loss is required an estimate of the loss is made and recorded to cost of sales in that quarter 

 

land inventory and related communities under development are reviewed for potential writedowns when impairment indicators are present we generally review our inventory at the community level and the inventory within each community may be categorized as land held for development residential land and lots developed and under development and construction in progress and finished homes based on the stage of production or plans for future development a particular community often includes inventory in more than one category in certain situations inventory may be analyzed separately for impairment purposes based on its product type eg single family homes evaluated separately from condominium parcels in reviewing each of our communities we determine if impairment indicators exist on inventory held and used by analyzing a variety of factors including but not limited to the following 

 

  

if indicators of impairment are present for a community we perform an analysis to determine if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts and if so impairment charges are required to be recorded if the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying amounts these estimates of cash flows are significantly impacted by community specific factors including estimates of the amounts and timing of future revenues and estimates of the amount of land development materials and labor costs which in turn may be impacted by the following local market conditions 

 

  

for those assets deemed to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets our determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams when an impairment charge for a community is determined the charge is then allocated to each lot in the community in the same manner as land and development costs are allocated to each lot the inventory within each community is categorized as construction in progress and finished homes residential land and lots developed and under development and land held for development based on the stage of production or plans for future development 

 

we typically do not purchase land for resale however when we own land or communities under development that no longer fit into our development and construction plans and we determine that the best use of the asset is the sale of the asset the project is accounted for as land held for sale assuming the land held for sale criteria are met we record land held for sale at the lesser of its carrying value or fair value less 

estimated costs to sell in performing impairment evaluation for land held for sale we consider several factors including but not limited to prices for land in recent comparable sales transactions market analysis studies which include the estimated price a willing buyer would pay for the land and recent legitimate offers received if the estimated fair value less costs to sell an asset is less than the current carrying value the asset is written down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell 

 

impairment charges are also recorded on finished homes in substantially completed communities when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values are greater than the fair values less estimated costs to sell these homes 

 

the key assumptions relating to the valuations are impacted by local market economic conditions and the actions of competitors and are inherently uncertain due to uncertainties in the estimation process actual results could differ from such estimates our quarterly assessments reflect management’s estimates and we continue to monitor the fair value of heldforsale assets through the disposition date 

 

land and lot option purchase contracts  — in the ordinary course of our homebuilding business we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts to procure land or lots for the construction of homes under these contracts we will fund a stated deposit in consideration for the right but not the obligation to purchase land or lots at a future point in time with predetermined terms under the terms of the option purchase contracts many of our option deposits are not refundable at our discretion 

 

option deposits and preacquisition costs we incur related to our land and lot option purchase contracts are capitalized if all of the following conditions have been met 1 the costs are directly identifiable with the specific property 2 the costs would be capitalized if the property were already acquired and 3 acquisition of the property is probable meaning we are actively seeking and have the ability to acquire the property and there is no indication that the property is not available for sale we also consider the following when determining if the acquisition of the property is probable 1 changes in market conditions subsequent to contracting for the purchase of the land 2 current contract terms including per lot price and required purchase dates and 3 our current land position in the given market or submarket option deposits and capitalized preacquisition costs are expensed to cost of sales when we believe it is probable that we will no longer acquire the land or lots under option and will not be able to recover these costs through other means 

 

we evaluate our land and lot option purchase contracts for the financial accounting and reporting of interests in certain variable interest entities which are defined as business entities that either have equity investors with voting rights disproportionate to their ownership interests or have equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entities to support their activities certain of our option purchase contracts result in the creation of a variable interest in the entity holding the land parcel under option we evaluate those land and lot option purchase contracts with variable interest entities to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary based upon analysis of the variability of the expected gains and losses of the entity the expected gains and losses are primarily determined by the amount of deposit required by the contract the time period or term of the contract and by analyzing the volatility in home sales prices as well as development and entitlement risk in each specific market based on this evaluation if we are the primary beneficiary of an entity with which we have entered into a land or lot option purchase contract the variable interest entity is consolidated since we own no equity interest in these unaffiliated variable interest entities we generally have little or no control or influence over the operations of these entities or their owners when our requests for financial information are denied by the land sellers certain assumptions about the assets and liabilities of such entities are required in most cases the fair value of the assets of the consolidated entities has been assumed to be the remaining contractual purchase price of the land or lots we are purchasing in these cases it is assumed that the entities have no debt obligations and the only asset recorded is the land or lots we have the option to buy with a related offset to noncontrolling interest for the assumed thirdparty investment in the variable interest entity creditors if any of these variable interest entities have no recourse against us 

 

fair value measurements  — we adopted the fasb’s authoritative guidance for fair value measurements of financial and nonfinancial instruments on october 1 2008 and 2009 respectively the guidance defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value 

measurements fair value is defined as the exchange exit price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date this standard establishes a threelevel hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability observable inputs are those which can be easily seen by market participants while unobservable inputs are generally developed internally utilizing management’s estimates and assumptions 

 

  

when available we use quoted market prices in active markets to determine fair value we consider the principal market and nonperformance risk associated with our counterparties when determining the fair value measurements fair value measurements are used for our marketable securities mortgage loans held for sale interest rate lock commitments irlcs and other derivative instruments on a recurring basis and are used for inventories and other mortgage loans on a nonrecurring basis when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

 

goodwill  — goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over net assets acquired we test goodwill for potential impairment annually as of september 30 or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the remaining balance of goodwill may not be recoverable in analyzing the potential impairment of goodwill a twostep process is utilized that begins with the estimation of the fair value of the operating segments the fair value is estimated primarily utilizing the present values of expected future cash flows if the results of the first step indicate that impairment potentially exists the second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment if any impairment is determined to exist when the estimated fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value the goodwill assessment procedures require us to make comprehensive estimates of future revenues and costs due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates actual results could differ from our estimates 

 

warranty claims  — we typically provide our homebuyers with a tenyear limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems a twoyear limited warranty on major mechanical systems and a oneyear limited warranty on other construction components since we subcontract our homebuilding work to subcontractors who typically provide us with an indemnity and a certificate of insurance prior to receiving payments for their work claims relating to workmanship and materials are generally the primary responsibility of the subcontractors warranty liabilities have been established by charging cost of sales for each home delivered the amounts charged are based on management’s estimate of expected warrantyrelated costs under all unexpired warranty obligation periods our warranty liability is based upon historical warranty cost experience in each market in which we operate and is adjusted as appropriate to reflect qualitative risks associated with the types of homes we build and the geographic areas in which we build them actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts a 10 change in the historical warranty rates used to estimate our warranty accrual would not result in a material change in our accrual 

 

insurance and legal claims  — we have and require the majority of the subcontractors we use to have general liability insurance which includes construction defect coverage our general liability insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from construction defect and other claims and lawsuits subject to selfinsured retentions and other coverage limits for policy years ended june 30 2004 through 2010 we are selfinsured for up to 225 million of the aggregate claims incurred at which point our excess loss insurance begins depending on the policy year once we have satisfied the annual aggregate limits we are selfinsured for the first 250000 to 10 million for each claim occurrence depending on the policy year for 

policy years 2010 and 2011 we are selfinsured for up to 200 million and 150 million respectively of the aggregate claims incurred and for up to 05 million of each claim occurrence thereafter 

 

in some states where we believe it is too difficult or expensive for our subcontractors to obtain general liability insurance we have waived our traditional subcontractor general liability insurance requirements to obtain lower costs from subcontractors in these states we purchase insurance policies from either thirdparty carriers or our whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary and name certain subcontractors as additional insureds the policies issued by our captive insurance subsidiary represent self insurance of these risks by us and are considered in the selfinsured amounts above for policy years after april 2007 the captive insurance subsidiary has acquired 150 million of reinsurance coverage with a thirdparty insurer 

 

we are selfinsured for the deductible amounts under our workers’ compensation insurance policies the deductibles vary by policy year but in no years exceed 05 million per occurrence the deductible for the 2010 and 2011 policy years is 05 million per occurrence 

 

we record expenses and liabilities related to the costs for exposures related to construction defects and claims and lawsuits incurred in the ordinary course of business including employment matters personal injury claims land development issues and contract disputes also we record expenses and liabilities for any estimated costs of potential construction defect claims and lawsuits including expected legal costs based on an analysis of our historical claims which includes an estimate of construction defect claims incurred but not yet reported related to the exposures for actual construction defect claims and estimates of construction defect claims incurred but not yet reported and other legal claims and lawsuits incurred in the ordinary course of business we estimate and record insurance receivables for these matters under applicable insurance policies when recovery is probable additionally we may have the ability to recover a portion of our legal expenses from our subcontractors when we have been named as an additional insured on their insurance policies the expenses liabilities and receivables related to these claims are subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends in construction defect claims relative to our markets the types of products we build claim settlement patterns insurance industry practices and legal interpretations among others a 10 increase in the claim rate and the average cost per claim used to estimate the selfinsured accruals would result in an increase of approximately 1580 million in our accrual and a 915 million increase in our receivable resulting in additional expense of 665 million while a 10 decrease in the claim rate and the average cost per claim would result in a decrease of approximately 1094 million in our accrual and a 755 million decrease in our receivable resulting in a reduction in our expense of 339 million 

 

income taxes  — we calculate a provision for or benefit from income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible in determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns judgment is required the accounting for deferred taxes is based upon an estimate of future results differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position changes in existing tax laws also affect actual tax results and the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 

 

interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in the financial statements as a component of the income tax provision significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions we evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis our evaluations are based upon a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change 

stockbased compensation  — from time to time the compensation committee of our board of directors authorizes the issuance of options to purchase our common stock to employees and directors the committee approves grants only out of amounts remaining available for grant from amounts formally authorized by our common stockholders options are granted at exercise prices which equal the market value of our common stock at the date of the grant generally the options vest over periods of 5 to 975 years and expire 10 years after the dates on which they were granted 

 

we measure and recognize compensation expense at an amount equal to the fair value of sharebased payments granted under compensation arrangements for all awards granted or modified after october 1 2005 using the modified prospective method compensation expense for any unvested stock option awards outstanding as of october 1 2005 is recognized on a straightline basis over the remaining vesting period we calculate the fair value of stock options using the blackscholes option pricing model determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions which involve a number of variables these variables include but are not limited to the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards the expected dividend yield and expected stock option exercise behavior in addition we also use judgment in estimating the number of sharebased awards that are expected to be forfeited 

 

recent accounting pronouncements 

 

in june 2009 the fasb revised the authoritative guidance for accounting for transfers of financial assets which requires enhanced disclosures regarding transfers of financial assets including securitization transactions and continuing exposure to the related risks the guidance eliminates the concept of a qualifying specialpurpose entity and changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2010 the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

in june 2009 the fasb revised the authoritative guidance for consolidating variable interest entities which changes how a company determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting or similar rights should be consolidated the determination of whether a company is required to consolidate an entity is based on among other things an entity’s purpose and design and a company’s ability to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance the guidance is effective for us beginning october 1 2010 the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

in january 2010 the fasb issued asu 201006 “improving disclosures about fair value measurements” which requires additional disclosures about transfers between levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy and disclosures about purchases sales issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level 3 fair value measurements this guidance was effective for us in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 except for the level 3 activity disclosures which are effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2010 the adoption of this guidance which is related to disclosure only will not impact our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

we are subject to interest rate risk on our longterm debt we monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and utilize both fixed and variable rate debt for fixed rate debt changes in interest rates generally affect the value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows conversely for variable rate debt changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument but may affect our future earnings and cash flows except in very limited circumstances we do not have an obligation to prepay fixedrate debt prior to maturity and as a result interest rate risk and changes in fair value would not have a significant impact on our cash flows related to our fixedrate debt until such time as we are required to refinance repurchase or repay such debt 

 

we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with our mortgage loan origination services we manage interest rate risk through the use of forward sales of mortgagebacked securities mbs eurodollar futures contracts edfc and put options on mbs and edfc use of the term “hedging instruments” in the following discussion refers to these securities collectively or in any combination we do not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 

 

interest rate lock commitments irlcs are extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and who meet defined credit and underwriting criteria typically the irlcs have a duration of less than six months some irlcs are committed immediately to a specific purchaser through the use of bestefforts whole loan delivery commitments while other irlcs are funded prior to being committed to thirdparty purchasers the hedging instruments related to irlcs are classified and accounted for as derivative instruments in an economic hedge with gains and losses recognized in current earnings hedging instruments related to funded uncommitted loans are accounted for at fair value with changes recognized in current earnings along with changes in the fair value of the funded uncommitted loans the fair value change related to the hedging instruments generally offsets the fair value change in the uncommitted loans and the fair value change which for the years ended september 30 2010 and 2009 was not significant is recognized in current earnings at september 30 2010 hedging instruments used to mitigate interest rate risk related to uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale and uncommitted irlcs totaled 2723 million uncommitted irlcs the duration of which are generally less than six months totaled approximately 1668 million and uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale totaled approximately 1271 million at september 30 2010 

 

at september 30 2010 we had 35 million notional amount of forward sales of mbs which were acquired as part of a program to potentially offer homebuyers a below market interest rate on their home financing these hedging instruments and the related commitments are accounted for at fair value with gains and losses recognized in current earnings these gains and losses for the years ended september 30 2010 2009 and 2008 were not material 

 

the following table sets forth principal cash flows by scheduled maturity weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value of our debt obligations as of september 30 2010 the interest rate for our variable rate debt represents the interest rate on our mortgage repurchase facility because the mortgage repurchase facility is effectively secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale which are typically sold within 60 days its outstanding balance is included as a variable rate maturity in the most current period presented

 item 1 business tableend  

dr horton inc is one of the largest homebuilding companies in the united states we construct and sell high quality homes through our operating divisions in 27 states and 75 metropolitan markets of the united states primarily under the name of dr horton america’s builder we are a fortune 500 company and our common stock is included in the sp 500 index and listed on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol “dhi” unless the context otherwise requires the terms “dr horton” the “company” “we” and “our” used herein refer to dr horton inc a delaware corporation and its predecessors and subsidiaries 

 

donald r horton began our homebuilding business in 1978 in 1991 we were incorporated in delaware to acquire the assets and businesses of our predecessor companies which were residential home construction and development companies owned or controlled by mr horton in 1992 we completed our initial public offering of our common stock the growth of our company over the years was achieved by investing available capital into our existing homebuilding markets and into startup operations in new markets additionally we acquired other homebuilding companies which strengthened our market position in existing markets and expanded our geographic presence and product offerings in other markets our homes generally range in size from 1000 to 4000 square feet and in price from 90000 to 700000 the current downturn in our industry has resulted in a substantial decrease in the size of our operations during the last three fiscal years as we have reacted to the significantly weakened market for new homes for the year ended september 30 2009 we closed 16703 homes with an average closing sales price of approximately 213400 

 

through our financial services operations we provide mortgage financing and title agency services to homebuyers in many of our homebuilding markets dhi mortgage our whollyowned subsidiary provides mortgage financing services principally to the purchasers of homes we build we generally do not retain or service the mortgages we originate but rather seek to sell the mortgages and related servicing rights to thirdparty purchasers dhi mortgage originates loans in accordance with purchaser guidelines and historically has sold substantially all of its mortgage production within 30 days of origination our subsidiary title companies serve as title insurance agents by providing title insurance policies examination and closing services primarily to the purchasers of our homes 

 

our financial reporting segments consist of six homebuilding segments and a financial services segment our homebuilding operations are the most substantial part of our business comprising approximately 99 of consolidated revenues which were 37 billion in fiscal 2009 our homebuilding operations generate most of their revenues from the sale of completed homes with a lesser amount from the sale of land and lots in addition to building traditional singlefamily detached homes we also build attached homes such as town homes duplexes triplexes and condominiums including some midrise buildings which share common walls and roofs the sale of detached homes generated approximately 81 77 and 81 of home sales revenues in fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively our financial services segment generates its revenues from originating and selling mortgages and collecting fees for title insurance agency and closing services 

 

we make available as soon as reasonably practicable on our internet website all of our reports required to be filed with the securities and exchange commission sec these reports include our annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k beneficial ownership reports on forms 3 4 and 5 proxy statements and amendments to such reports these reports are available in the “investor relations” section of our internet website we will also provide these reports in electronic or paper format to our stockholders free of charge upon request made to our investor relations department our sec filings are also available to the public over the internet at the sec’s website at wwwsecgov and the public may read and copy any document we file at the sec’s public reference room located at 100 f street ne washington dc 20549 please call the sec at 1800sec0330 for further information on the operation of the public reference room

operating strategy 

 

for the greatest part of our company’s existence we maintained significant yearoveryear growth and profitability we achieved this growth through an operating strategy focused on capturing greater market share while also maintaining a strong balance sheet to execute our strategy we invested available capital in our existing homebuilding markets and opportunistically entered new markets we also actively evaluated homebuilding acquisition opportunities as they arose some of which resulted in acquisitions and contributed to our growth 

 

due to the progressive and substantial weakening of demand in our homebuilding markets over the past three years we have experienced declines in revenues and gross profit sustained significant asset impairment charges and incurred losses in fiscal 2007 2008 and 2009 we believe the longterm fundamentals which support housing demand namely population growth and household formation remain positive in the near term however it is not possible to predict how long the weak market conditions will persist and if the homebuilding industry will experience further deterioration or if conditions will stabilize and then begin to improve during the downturn we have aggressively reduced inventory levels and increased our cash balances we have been successful in generating substantial cash flow from operations primarily through inventory reductions and from the receipt of a tax refund from a loss carryback we have also increased our cash balance by accessing the capital markets while we will continue to conservatively manage our business we believe this increase in our liquidity provides us with flexibility in determining the appropriate operating strategy for each of our communities and markets to strike the best balance between cash flow generation and potential profit 

 

geographic diversity 

 

from 1978 to late 1987 our homebuilding activities were conducted in the dallasfort worth area we then began diversifying geographically by entering additional markets both through startup operations and acquisitions we now operate in 27 states and 75 markets this provides us with geographic diversification in our homebuilding inventory investments and our sources of revenues and earnings we believe our diversification strategy helps to mitigate the effects of local and regional economic cycles and enhances our longterm potential 

 

economies of scale 

 

we are one of the largest homebuilding companies in the united states in terms of number of homes closed in fiscal 2009 by the same measure we are also one of the five largest builders in many of our markets in fiscal 2009 we believe that our national regional and local scale of operations has provided us with benefits that may not be available in the same degree to some other smaller homebuilders such as 

 

  

decentralized operations 

 

we decentralize our homebuilding activities to give operating flexibility to our local division presidents on certain key operating decisions at september 30 2009 we had 31 separate homebuilding operating divisions many of which operate in more than one market area generally each operating division consists of 

a division president land entitlement acquisition and development personnel a sales manager and sales personnel a construction manager and construction superintendents customer service personnel a controller a purchasing manager and office staff we believe that division presidents and their management teams who are familiar with local conditions generally have better information on which to base decisions regarding their operations our division presidents receive performance bonuses based upon achieving targeted financial and operational measures in their operating divisions 

 

operating division responsibilities 

 

each operating division is responsible for 

 

  

— a feasibility study 

 

— soil and environmental reviews 

 

— review of existing zoning and other governmental requirements and 

 

— review of the need for and extent of offsite work required to meet local building codes 

 

  

centralized controls 

 

we centralize the key risk elements of our homebuilding business through our regional and corporate offices we have four separate homebuilding regional offices generally each regional office consists of a region president legal counsel a chief financial officer a purchasing manager and limited office support staff each of our region presidents and their management teams are responsible for oversight of the operations of up to nine homebuilding operating divisions including 

 

  

our corporate executives and corporate office departments are responsible for establishing our operational policies and internal control standards and for monitoring compliance with established policies and controls throughout our operations the corporate office also has primary responsibility for direct management of certain key risk elements and initiatives through the following centralized functions 

 

 3 

 

  

cost management 

 

we control overhead costs by centralizing certain administrative and accounting functions and by closely monitoring the number of administrative personnel and management positions in our operating divisions as well as in our regional and corporate offices we also minimize advertising costs by participating in promotional activities sponsored by local real estate brokers 

 

we control construction costs by striving to design our homes efficiently and by obtaining competitive bids for construction materials and labor we also seek to negotiate favorable pricing from our primary subcontractors and suppliers based on the volume of services and products we purchase from them on a local regional and national basis we monitor our construction costs on each house through our purchasing and construction budgeting systems and we monitor our inventory levels margins returns and expenses through our management information systems 

 

acquisitions 

 

as negative market conditions in the housing industry persist we remain committed to maintaining our strong balance sheet and liquidity however we will continue to evaluate opportunities for strategic acquisitions we believe that the current housing industry downturn may provide us selected opportunities to enhance our operations through the acquisition of existing homebuilding companies at attractive valuations in certain instances such acquisitions can provide us benefits not found in startup operations such as established land positions and inventories and existing relationships with municipalities land owners developers subcontractors and suppliers we have sought to limit the risks associated with acquiring other companies by conducting extensive operational financial and legal due diligence on each acquisition and by only acquiring homebuilding companies that we believe have a positive impact on our earnings within an acceptable period of time 

markets 

 

we conduct our homebuilding operations in all of the geographic regions states and markets listed below and we conduct our mortgage and title operations in many of these markets our homebuilding operating divisions are aggregated into six reporting segments also referred to as reporting regions which comprise the markets below our financial statements contain additional information regarding segment performance 

 

 

 

 

when evaluating new or existing homebuilding markets for purposes of capital allocation we consider the local marketspecific factors including among others 

 

  

land policies 

 

we acquire land after we have completed appropriate due diligence and generally after we have obtained the rights known as entitlements to begin development or construction work resulting in an acceptable number of residential lots before we acquire lots or tracts of land we will among other things complete a feasibility study which includes soil tests independent environmental studies and other engineering work and evaluate the status of necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements required to develop and use the property for home construction although we purchase and develop land primarily to support our homebuilding activities we also sell land and lots to other developers and homebuilders where we have excess land and lot positions 

 

we also enter into landlot option contracts in which we obtain the right but generally not the obligation to buy land or lots at predetermined prices on a defined schedule commensurate with anticipated home closings or planned land development our option contracts generally are nonrecourse which limits our financial exposure to our earnest money deposited with land and lot sellers and any preacquisition due diligence costs incurred by us this enables us to control land and lot positions with limited capital investment which substantially reduces the risks associated with land ownership and development 

 

almost all of our land and lot positions are acquired directly by us we have avoided entering into joint venture arrangements due to their increased costs and complexity as well as the loss of operational control inherent in such arrangements we are a party to a very small number of joint ventures that were acquired through acquisitions of other homebuilders all of these joint ventures are consolidated in our financial statements 

 

we attempt to mitigate our exposure to real estate inventory risks by 

 

 6 

 

  

the benefits of this strategy have been limited by the sustained weak conditions in the homebuilding industry over the past three fiscal years 

 

construction 

 

our home designs are selected or prepared in each of our markets to appeal to local tastes and preferences of homebuyers in each community we also offer optional interior and exterior features to allow homebuyers to enhance the basic home design and to allow us to generate additional revenues from each home sold we have adjusted our product offerings to address affordability issues which have become increasingly important in the current weak market conditions 

 

substantially all of our construction work is performed by subcontractors subcontractors typically are retained for a specific subdivision pursuant to a contract that obligates the subcontractor to complete construction at an agreedupon price agreements with the subcontractors and suppliers we use generally are negotiated for each subdivision we compete with other homebuilders for qualified subcontractors raw materials and lots in the markets where we operate we employ construction superintendents to monitor homes under construction participate in major design and building decisions coordinate the activities of subcontractors and suppliers review the work of subcontractors for quality and cost controls and monitor compliance with zoning and building codes in addition our construction superintendents play a significant role in working with our homebuyers by assisting with option selection and home modification decisions educating buyers on the construction process and instructing buyers on postclosing home maintenance 

 

construction time for our homes depends on the weather availability of labor materials and supplies size of the home and other factors we typically complete the construction of a home within three to six months 

 

we typically do not maintain significant inventories of construction materials except for work in progress materials for homes under construction generally the construction materials used in our operations are readily available from numerous sources we have contracts exceeding one year with certain suppliers of our building materials that are cancelable at our option with a 30 day notice in recent years we have not experienced delays in construction due to shortages of materials or labor that have materially affected our consolidated operating results 

 

marketing and sales 

 

we market and sell our homes through commissioned employees and independent real estate brokers we typically conduct home sales from sales offices located in furnished model homes in each subdivision and we typically do not offer our model homes for sale until the completion of a subdivision our sales personnel assist prospective homebuyers by providing them with floor plans price information tours of model homes and assisting them with the selection of options and other custom features we train and inform our sales personnel as to the availability of financing construction schedules and marketing and advertising plans as our customers are typically firsttime or moveup homebuyers we attempt to adjust our product mix and pricing within our homebuilding markets to keep our homes affordable as market conditions warrant we may provide potential homebuyers with one or more of a variety of incentives including discounts and free upgrades to be competitive in a particular market due to the weak industry conditions of the past three fiscal years we have offered an increased level of incentives to homebuyers 

 

we advertise in our local markets as necessary through newspapers marketing brochures newsletters and email or other electronic means to prospective homebuyers and real estate brokers we also use billboards radio and television advertising and our internet website to market the location price range and availability of 

our homes to minimize advertising costs we attempt to operate in subdivisions in conspicuous locations that permit us to take advantage of local traffic patterns we also believe that model homes play a substantial role in our marketing efforts so we expend significant effort to create an attractive atmosphere in our model homes 

 

in addition to using model homes we build a limited number of speculative homes in each subdivision these homes enhance our marketing and sales efforts to prospective homebuyers who are relocating to these markets as well as to independent brokers who often represent homebuyers requiring a completed home within a short time frame we determine our speculative homes strategy in each market based on local market factors such as new job growth the number of job relocations housing demand seasonality current sales contract cancellation trends and our past experience in the market we determine the number of speculative homes to build in each subdivision based on our current and planned sales pace and we monitor and adjust speculative home inventory on an ongoing basis as conditions warrant we typically have sold a substantial majority of our speculative homes while they are under construction or soon after completion however the significant weakness in our housing markets and related high cancellation rates during recent years had caused our speculative home inventory to remain higher than our target levels during fiscal 2009 we were able to reduce both total and speculative homes in inventory from the prior year levels we do expect to maintain a level of speculative home inventory in our markets which will be based on our expectations of future sales and closings volume we believe these speculative homes help to provide us with opportunities to sell additional homes at a profit reduce our inventory of owned lots and generate positive cash flows 

 

our sales contracts require an earnest money deposit of at least 500 the amount of earnest money required varies between markets and subdivisions and may significantly exceed 500 additionally customers are generally required to pay additional deposits when they select options or upgrade features for their homes most of our sales contracts stipulate that when customers cancel their contracts with us we have the right to retain their earnest money and option deposits however our operating divisions occasionally choose to refund such deposits our sales contracts also include a financing contingency which permits customers to cancel and receive a refund of their deposits if they cannot obtain mortgage financing at prevailing or specified interest rates within a specified period our contracts may include other contingencies such as the sale of an existing home as a percentage of gross sales orders cancellations of sales contracts in fiscal 2009 were 30 while this reflects an improvement from the prior year our cancellation rate continues to be significantly higher than our historical rate of approximately 20 before the current downturn in the homebuilding industry reflecting the continuing weak housing market conditions the length of time between the signing of a sales contract for a home and delivery of the home to the buyer closing is generally from two to six months 

 

customer service and quality control 

 

our operating divisions are responsible for preclosing quality control inspections and responding to customers’ postclosing needs we believe that a prompt and courteous response to homebuyers’ needs during and after construction reduces postclosing repair costs enhances our reputation for quality and service and ultimately leads to significant repeat and referral business from the real estate community and homebuyers we typically provide our homebuyers with a tenyear limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems a twoyear limited warranty on major mechanical systems and a oneyear limited warranty on other construction components the subcontractors who perform the actual construction also provide us with warranties on workmanship and are generally prepared to respond to us and the homeowner promptly upon request in addition some of our suppliers provide manufacturer’s warranties on specified products installed in the home 

 

sales order backlog 

 

at september 30 2009 the value of our backlog of sales orders was 11420 million 5628 homes a decrease of 5 from 12074 million 5297 homes at september 30 2008 the average sales price of homes in backlog was 202900 at september 30 2009 down 11 from the 227900 average at september 30 2008 sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies including mortgage loan approval and 

buyers selling their existing homes which can result in cancellations a portion of the contracts in backlog will not result in closings due to cancellations substantially all of the closings from our sales backlog at september 30 2009 are scheduled for fiscal year 2010 further discussion of our backlog is provided in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

 

customer mortgage financing 

 

we provide mortgage financing services principally to purchasers of our homes in the majority of our homebuilding markets through our whollyowned subsidiary dhi mortgage dhi mortgage coordinates and expedites the sales transaction by ensuring that mortgage commitments are received and that closings take place in a timely and efficient manner dhi mortgage originates mortgage loans for a substantial portion of our homebuyers and when necessary to fulfill the needs of some homebuyers also brokers loans to thirdparty lenders who directly originate the mortgage loans during the year ended september 30 2009 approximately 83 of dhi mortgage’s loan volume related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations and dhi mortgage provided mortgage financing services for approximately 67 of our total homes closed 

 

to limit the risks associated with our mortgage operations dhi mortgage only originates loan products that it believes may be sold to thirdparty purchasers dhi mortgage generally packages and sells the loans and their servicing rights to thirdparty purchasers shortly after origination with limited recourse provisions in markets where we currently do not provide mortgage financing we work with a variety of mortgage lenders that make available to homebuyers a range of mortgage financing programs 

 

title services 

 

through our subsidiary title companies we serve as a title insurance agent in selected markets by providing title insurance policies examination and closing services to the purchasers of homes we build and sell we currently assume little or no underwriting risk associated with these title policies 

 

employees 

 

at september 30 2009 we employed 2926 persons of whom 695 were sales and marketing personnel 981 were executive administrative and clerical personnel 648 were involved in construction and 602 worked in mortgage and title operations we had fewer than 10 employees covered by collective bargaining agreements employees of some of the subcontractors which we use are represented by labor unions or are subject to collective bargaining agreements we believe that our relations with our employees and subcontractors are good 

 

competition 

 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive we compete in each of our markets with numerous other national regional and local homebuilders for homebuyers desirable properties raw materials skilled labor and financing we also compete with resales of existing homes and with the rental housing market our homes compete on the basis of quality price design mortgage financing terms and location in the current weak housing conditions competition among homebuilders has greatly intensified especially as to pricing and incentives as builders attempt to maximize sales volume despite the weakness in housing demand the current market conditions have also led to a large number of foreclosed homes being offered for sale which has increased competition for homebuyers and affected pricing our financial services business competes with other mortgage lenders including national regional and local mortgage bankers and other financial institutions some of which have greater access to capital different lending criteria and potentially broader product offerings 

 

governmental regulation and environmental matters 

 

the homebuilding industry is subject to extensive and complex regulations we and the subcontractors we use must comply with various federal state and local laws and regulations including zoning density and 

development requirements building environmental advertising and real estate sales rules and regulations these requirements affect the development process as well as building materials to be used building designs and minimum elevation of properties our homes are inspected by local authorities where required and homes eligible for insurance or guarantees provided by the federal housing administration fha and the veterans administration va are subject to inspection by them these regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities in addition our new housing developments may be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets and other public improvements 

 

our homebuilding operations are also subject to a variety of local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning protection of health safety and the environment the particular environmental laws for each site vary greatly according to location environmental condition and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties 

 

our mortgage company and title insurance agencies must also comply with various federal and state laws and regulations these include eligibility and other requirements for participation in the programs offered by the fha va government national mortgage association gnma federal national mortgage association fannie mae and federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac these also include required compliance with consumer lending and other laws and regulations such as disclosure requirements prohibitions against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures all of these laws and regulations may subject our operations to examination by the applicable agencies 

 

seasonality 

 

we have typically experienced seasonal variations in our quarterly operating results and capital requirements prior to the current downturn in the homebuilding industry we generally had more homes under construction closed more homes and had greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year this seasonal activity increased our working capital requirements for our homebuilding operations during the third and fourth fiscal quarters and increased our funding requirements for the mortgages we originated in our financial services segment at the end of these quarters as a result of seasonal activity our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year 

 

in contrast to our typical seasonal results due to the weakness in homebuilding market conditions during the past three years we have incurred consolidated operating losses each quarter since the third quarter of fiscal 2007 during these periods the challenging market conditions caused declines in sales volume pricing and margins that mitigated our historical seasonal variations although we may experience our typical historical seasonal pattern in the future given the current market conditions we can make no assurances as to when or whether this pattern will recur

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

discussion of our business and operations included in this annual report on form 10k should be read together with the risk factors set forth below they describe various risks and uncertainties we are or may become subject to many of which are difficult to predict or beyond our control these risks and uncertainties together with other factors described elsewhere in this report have the potential to affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner 

 

the homebuilding industry is undergoing a significant downturn and its duration and ultimate severity are uncertain a continuation or further deterioration in industry conditions or in the broader economic conditions could have additional adverse effects on our business and financial results 

 

the downturn in the homebuilding industry is in its fourth year and it has become one of the most severe housing downturns in us history the significant declines in the demand for new homes the significant oversupply of homes on the market and the significant reductions in the availability of financing for homebuyers that have marked the downturn are continuing we have experienced material reductions in our 

home sales and homebuilding revenues and we have incurred material inventory and goodwill impairments and other writeoffs it is not clear when these trends will reverse or when we will return to profitability 

 

our ability to respond to the downturn has been limited by adverse industry and economic conditions the significant amount of home mortgage foreclosures has increased supply and driven down prices making the purchase of a foreclosed home an attractive alternative to purchasing a new home homebuilders have responded to declining sales and increased cancellation rates with significant concessions further adding to the price declines with the decline in the values of homes and in the ability of some homeowners to make their mortgage payments the credit markets have been significantly disrupted putting strains on many households and businesses in the face of these conditions the overall economy has weakened significantly with high unemployment levels and substantially reduced consumer spending and confidence as a result demand for new homes remains at historically low levels 

 

these challenging conditions are complex and interrelated we cannot predict their duration or ultimate severity nor can we provide assurance that our responses to the homebuilding downturn or the government’s attempts to address the troubles in the overall economy will be successful additionally we cannot predict the timing or effect of the winding down or possible withdrawal of government intervention or support 

 

the continuing constriction of the credit markets could limit our ability to access capital and increase our costs of capital 

 

during this downturn in the homebuilding industry we have relied principally on the positive operating cash flow we have generated to meet our working capital needs and repay outstanding indebtedness we generated substantial operating cash flow during this time however the downturn and the constriction of the credit markets have reduced the other sources of liquidity available to us and increased our costs of capital 

 

in may 2009 we voluntarily terminated our 165 billion unsecured revolving credit facility although we had no cash borrowings outstanding under the facility during fiscal 2009 the borrowing base limitations applicable to the facility had reduced availability significantly and we believed that seeking an amendment to the facility for relief from these limitations would have increased the costs of borrowing reduced the overall credit commitment available under the facility and possibly involved additional restrictions on us we have since relied on shortterm arrangements with some of the lenders for the letters of credit we require in our business a new line of credit should we decide to pursue one may be difficult to obtain on favorable terms in the current circumstances of our business and the overall economy it would also likely involve additional financing costs and restrictions on our business not having a line in place could reduce our flexibility in responding to or taking advantage of changing conditions in the homebuilding industry or require us to use our own cash resources in doing so 

 

our financial services segment uses a 100 million mortgage repurchase facility to finance many of the loans it originates the facility must be renewed annually and the current facility expires in march 2010 a continuation of current market conditions could make the renewal more difficult or could result in an increase in the cost of the facility or a decrease in its committed availability such conditions may also make it more difficult or costly to sell the mortgages that we originate 

 

as of september 30 2009 we had 3084 million of debt maturing in the next 12 months we believe we can meet these and our other capital requirements with our existing cash resources and future cash flows and if required other sources of financing that we anticipate will be available to us however we can provide no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so particularly if current industry or economic conditions continue or deteriorate further the future effects on our business liquidity and financial results of these conditions could be material and adverse both in ways described above and in other ways that we do not currently foresee 

 

we use letters of credit and surety bonds to secure our performance under various construction and land development agreements escrow agreements financial guarantees and other arrangements should our future performance or economic conditions make these more difficult to obtain or more costly our business or financial results could be adversely affected 

the reduction in availability of mortgage financing has adversely affected our business and the duration and ultimate severity of the effects are uncertain 

 

during the last three fiscal years the mortgage lending industry has experienced significant instability beginning with increased defaults on subprime loans and other nonconforming loans and compounded by expectations of increasing interest payment requirements and further defaults this in turn resulted in a decline in the market value of many mortgage loans and related securities lenders regulators and others questioned the adequacy of lending standards and other credit requirements for several loan products and programs offered in recent years credit requirements tightened and investor demand for mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities declined the deterioration in credit quality has caused almost all lenders to eliminate subprime mortgages and most other loan products that are not eligible for sale to fannie mae or freddie mac or loans that do not meet fha and va requirements fewer loan products tighter loan qualifications and a reduced willingness of lenders to make loans in turn have made it more difficult for many buyers to finance the purchase of our homes these factors have served to reduce the pool of qualified homebuyers and made it more difficult to sell to firsttime and moveup buyers which have long made up a substantial part of our customers these reductions in demand have adversely affected our business and financial results and the duration and severity of the effects are uncertain 

 

we believe that the liquidity provided by fannie mae and freddie mac to the mortgage industry has been very important to the housing market these entities have required substantial injections of capital from the federal government and may require additional government support in the future any reduction in the availability of the financing provided by these institutions could adversely affect interest rates mortgage availability and our sales of new homes and mortgage loans 

 

we believe that the purchases of mortgagebacked securities by the federal reserve system the fed have helped to keep mortgage interest rates low during much of fiscal 2009 the fed has announced their intention to end these purchases in early 2010 this action will likely lead to higher mortgage interest rates which would adversely impact our sales of homes 

 

because of the decline in the availability of other mortgage products fha and va mortgage financing support has become a more important factor in marketing our homes the american housing rescue and foreclosure prevention act of 2008 however increased a buyer’s down payment requirement for fha insured loans additionally under revised guidelines currently projected to become effective in december 2009 guidelines on fha insured loans on condominiums will become significantly more restrictive in addition increased demands on the fha have resulted in a reduction of its cash reserves these factors or further increases in down payment requirements or limitations or restrictions on the availability of fha and va financing support could adversely affect interest rates mortgage availability and our sales of new homes and mortgage loans 

 

in recent years many of our homebuyers used down payment assistance programs which allowed them to receive gift funds from nonprofit corporations as a down payment homebuilders had been a source of funding for these programs however the american housing rescue and foreclosure prevention act of 2008 eliminated sellerfunded down payment assistance on fhainsured loans approved on or after october 1 2008 with the elimination of these gift fund programs these customers have been required to seek other down payment programs or other sources for 100 financing such as that offered by the united states department of agriculture usda there can be no assurance that such alternative programs will continue to be available or will be as attractive to our customers as the programs previously offered which could cause our sales to suffer 

 

in february 2009 the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 was enacted into law this legislation included a federal tax credit for qualified firsttime homebuyers purchasing a principal residence on or after january 1 2009 and before december 1 2009 in november 2009 this credit was expanded to be available to more homebuyers and extended until june 2010 our sales in future periods may be adversely affected when this tax credit expires 

even if potential customers do not need financing changes in the availability of mortgage products may make it harder for them to sell their current homes to potential buyers who need financing 

 

if interest rates increase the costs of owning a home will be affected and could result in further reductions in the demand for our homes 

 

in addition the recently proposed restoring american financial stability act of 2009 contains provisions that require companies that sell products like mortgagebacked securities to retain at least 10 of the credit risk of the underlying assets if this or other attempts to impose more risk on mortgage securitizers are enacted the pricing and availability of mortgage products our customers rely on to purchase our homes may be adversely affected similarly to the extent any future legislation attempts to enact credit risk retention requirements on mortgage originators the risk profile of our financial services business and its support of our homebuilding business could be adversely affected 

 

our strategies in responding to the adverse conditions in the homebuilding industry have had limited success and the continued implementation of these and other strategies may not be successful 

 

while we have been successful in generating positive operating cash flow and reducing our inventories in the last three fiscal years we have done so at significantly reduced gross profit levels and have incurred significant asset impairment charges these contributed to the net losses we recognized during these periods also during this time notwithstanding our sales strategies we continued to experience an elevated rate of sales contract cancellations we believe that the increase in the cancellation rate is largely due to reduced homebuyer confidence due principally to continued price declines the growing number of foreclosures and continuing job losses in the economy a more restrictive mortgage lending environment and the inability of some buyers to sell their existing homes have also impacted cancellations many of these factors which affect new sales and cancellation rates are beyond our control it is uncertain how long the reduction in sales and the increased level of cancellations will continue if these conditions continue for a protracted period it is not clear whether our strategies will succeed in maintaining or increasing our sales volume or our current margins 

 

a return of inflation could adversely affect our business and financial results particularly in a period of oversupply of homes 

 

inflation can adversely affect us by increasing costs of land materials and labor in the event of a return of inflation we may seek to increase the sales prices of homes in order to maintain satisfactory margins however a continuation of the oversupply of homes relative to demand may make this difficult in addition inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates which have a negative impact on housing demand in such an environment we may not be able to raise home prices sufficiently to keep up with the rate of inflation and our margins could decrease moreover with inflation the costs of capital increase and the purchasing power of our cash resources can decline current or future efforts by the government to stimulate the economy may increase the risk of significant inflation and its adverse impact on our business or financial results 

 

the homebuilding industry is cyclical and affected by changes in general economic real estate or other business conditions that could adversely affect our business or financial results 

 

the homebuilding industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in industry conditions as well as in general and local economic conditions such as 

 

 13 

 

these may occur on a national scale like the current downturn or may affect some of the regions or markets in which we operate more than others when adverse conditions affect any of our larger markets they could have a proportionately greater impact on us than on some other homebuilding companies our operations in previously strong markets particularly california florida nevada and arizona have more adversely affected our financial results than our other markets in the current downturn 

 

an oversupply of alternatives to new homes including foreclosed homes homes held for sale by investors and speculators other existing homes and rental properties can also reduce our ability to sell new homes and depress new home prices and reduce our margins on the sales of new homes high levels of foreclosures not only contribute to additional inventory available for sale but also reduce appraisal valuations for new homes potentially resulting in lower sales prices 

 

weather conditions and natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes wildfires volcanic activity droughts and floods can harm our homebuilding business these can delay home closings adversely affect the cost or availability of materials or labor or damage homes under construction the climates and geology of many of the states in which we operate including california florida and texas where we have some of our larger operations present increased risks of adverse weather or natural disasters in part because of their cyclically recurring nature there 

 

continued military deployments in the middle east and other overseas regions terrorist attacks other acts of violence or threats to national security and any corresponding response by the united states or others or related domestic or international instability may adversely affect general economic conditions or cause a slowdown of the economy 

 

as a result of the foregoing matters potential customers may be less willing or able to buy our homes because of current industry and economic conditions we have not been able to increase the sale prices of our homes in the future our pricing strategies may also be limited by market conditions we may be unable to change the mix of our home offerings reduce the costs of the homes we build or offer more affordable homes to maintain our margins or satisfactorily address changing market conditions in other ways in addition cancellations of home sales contracts in backlog may increase as homebuyers choose to not honor their contracts 

 

our financial services business is closely related to our homebuilding business as it originates mortgage loans principally to purchasers of the homes we build a decrease in the demand for our homes because of the foregoing matters may also adversely affect the financial results of this segment of our business an increase in the default rate on the mortgages we originate may adversely affect our ability to sell the mortgages or the pricing we receive upon the sale of mortgages or may increase our repurchase or other obligations for previous originations during fiscal 2009 we increased our reserves related to mortgages we have sold because of the uncertainties inherent to these matters actual future obligations could differ significantly from our currently estimated amounts 

 

the risks associated with our land and lot inventory could adversely affect our business or financial results 

 

inventory risks are substantial for our homebuilding business the risks inherent in controlling or purchasing and developing land increase as consumer demand for housing decreases thus we may have acquired options on or bought and developed land at a cost we will not be able to recover fully or on which we cannot build and sell homes profitably our deposits for building lots controlled under option or similar contracts may be put at risk the value of undeveloped land building lots and housing inventories can also fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions in addition inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in reduced margins or losses in a poorly performing community or market in the present weak market conditions we have sold homes and land for lower margins or at a loss and we have recorded significant inventory impairment charges 

 

historically our goals for years of supply for ownership and control of land and building lots were based on management’s expectations for future volume growth in light of the much weaker market conditions encountered since fiscal 2006 we significantly slowed our purchases of undeveloped land and our 

development spending on land we own and made substantial land and lot sales as part of our strategy to reduce our inventory to better match our reduced rate of production we also terminated numerous land option contracts and wrote off earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs related to these option contracts because future market conditions are uncertain we cannot provide assurance that these measures will be successful in managing our future inventory risks our flexibility in responding to changes in market conditions may have been reduced as the amount of our land and lot positions controlled by option and similar contracts has declined 

 

supply shortages and other risks related to demand for building materials and skilled labor could increase our costs and delay deliveries 

 

the homebuilding industry has from time to time experienced significant difficulties that can affect the cost or timing of construction including 

 

  

these may cause us to take longer or incur more costs to build our homes and adversely affect our revenues and margins 

 

increases in the costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business or financial results 

 

significant expenses of owning a home including mortgage interest and real estate taxes generally are deductible expenses for an individual’s federal and in some cases state income taxes subject to various limitations under current tax law and policy if the federal government or a state government changes its income tax laws as has been discussed from time to time to eliminate or substantially modify these income tax deductions the aftertax cost of owning a new home would increase for many of our potential customers the resulting loss or reduction of homeowner tax deductions if such tax law changes were enacted without offsetting provisions would adversely impact demand for and sales prices of new homes 

 

in addition increases in property tax rates by local governmental authorities as experienced in response to reduced federal and state funding can adversely affect the ability of potential customers to obtain financing or their desire to purchase new homes 

 

governmental regulations could increase the cost and limit the availability of our development and homebuilding projects and adversely affect our business or financial results 

 

we are subject to extensive and complex regulations that affect land development and home construction including zoning density restrictions building design and building standards these regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities as to the conditions we must meet prior to being approved if approved at all we are subject to determinations by these authorities as to the adequacy of water or sewage facilities roads or other local services new housing developments may also be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets and other public improvements in addition in many markets government authorities have implemented no growth or growth control initiatives any of these can limit delay or increase the costs of development or home construction 

 

we are also subject to a variety of local state and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of health safety and the environment the impact of environmental laws varies depending upon the prior uses of 

the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available these matters may result in delays may cause us to incur substantial compliance remediation mitigation and other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas 

 

governmental regulation of our financial services operations could adversely affect our business or financial results 

 

our financial services operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations these include eligibility requirements for participation in federal loan programs compliance with consumer lending and similar requirements such as disclosure requirements prohibitions against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures they may also subject our operations to examination by the applicable agencies these factors may limit our ability to provide mortgage financing or title services to potential purchasers of our homes 

 

the turmoil caused by the increasing number of defaults in subprime and other mortgages has encouraged consumer lawsuits and the investigation of financial services industry practices by governmental authorities these investigations could include the examination of consumer lending practices sales of mortgages to financial institutions and other investors and the practices in the financial services segments of homebuilding companies we are unable to assess whether these governmental inquiries will result in changes in government regulation homebuilding industry practices or adversely affect the costs or potential profitability of homebuilding companies 

 

homebuilding is subject to home warranty and construction defect claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant 

 

as a homebuilder we are subject to home warranty and construction defect claims arising in the ordinary course of business as a consequence we maintain product liability insurance obtain indemnities and certificates of insurance from subcontractors generally covering claims related to workmanship and materials and create warranty and other reserves for the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built because of the uncertainties inherent to these matters we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will be adequate to address all of our warranty and construction defect claims in the future contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce we may be responsible for applicable selfinsured retentions and some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits additionally the coverage offered by and the availability of product liability insurance for construction defects is currently limited and costly we have responded to increases in insurance costs and coverage limitations in recent years by increasing our selfinsured retentions and claim reserves there can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted or become more costly 

 

our substantial debt could adversely affect our financial condition 

 

we have a significant amount of debt as of september 30 2009 our consolidated debt was 32773 million as of september 30 2009 the scheduled maturities of principal on our outstanding debt for the subsequent 12 months totaled 3084 million the indentures from our senior senior convertible and senior subordinated notes do not restrict the incurrence of future unsecured debt and they permit significant amounts of secured debt we do not currently have a revolving credit facility for our homebuilding operations if we choose to enter into a new line of credit agreement it may limit the amount of debt we could incur 

 

possible consequences the amount and the maturities of our debt could have important consequences for example they could 

 

 16 

 

  

dependence on future performance our ability to meet our debt service and other obligations will depend in part upon our future financial performance our future results are subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report these have been compounded by the current industry and economic conditions our revenues and earnings vary with the level of general economic activity in the markets we serve our businesses are also affected by financial political business and other factors many of which are beyond our control the factors that affect our ability to generate cash can also affect our ability to raise additional funds for these purposes through the sale of debt or equity the refinancing of debt or the sale of assets 

 

mortgage repurchase facility and other restrictions the mortgage repurchase facility for our financial services subsidiaries requires the maintenance of a minimum level of tangible net worth a maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and a minimum level of liquidity by our financial services subsidiaries a failure to comply with these requirements could allow the lending bank to terminate the availability of funds to the financial services subsidiaries or cause their debt to become due and payable prior to maturity any difficulty experienced in complying with these covenants could make the renewal of the facility more difficult or costly 

 

in addition the indentures governing our senior notes and senior subordinated notes impose restrictions on the creation of secured debt and liens 

 

as a result of terminating our revolving credit facility we are no longer subject to the restrictions on our operations and activities that it imposed on us however if we decide to enter into another revolving credit agreement it is likely that we will again become subject to these types of provisions which may be more restrictive than those found in our previous facility 

 

changes in debt ratings in fiscal 2008 all three of the agencies that rate our senior unsecured debt lowered our ratings to a level below investment grade and these agencies have since lowered our ratings even further the cost of debt capital has increased and could increase more with further lowering of our debt ratings the further lowering of our debt ratings could also make accessing the public capital markets more difficult and expensive 

 

change of control purchase options if a change of control occurs as defined in the indentures governing many series of our senior and senior subordinated notes which constituted 10 billion principal amount in the aggregate as of september 30 2009 we would be required to offer to purchase these notes at 101 of their principal amount together with all accrued and unpaid interest if any if a fundamental change including a change of control occurs as defined in the indenture governing our convertible senior notes which constituted 500 million principal amount as of september 30 2009 we would be required to offer to purchase these notes at par together with all accrued and unpaid interest if any if purchase offers were required under the indentures for these notes we can give no assurance that we would have sufficient funds to pay the amounts that we would be required to purchase 

 

impact of financial services debt our financial services business is conducted through subsidiaries that are not restricted by our indentures the ability of our financial services subsidiaries to provide funds to our homebuilding operations however is subject to restrictions in their mortgage repurchase facility these funds would not be available to us upon the occurrence and during the continuance of defaults under this facility moreover our right to receive assets from these subsidiaries upon liquidation or recapitalization will be subject to the prior claims of the creditors of these subsidiaries any claims we may have to funds from this segment would be subordinate to subsidiary indebtedness to the extent of any security for such indebtedness and to any indebtedness otherwise recognized as senior to our claims 

homebuilding and financial services are very competitive and competitive conditions could adversely affect our business or financial results 

 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive homebuilders compete not only for homebuyers but also for desirable properties financing raw materials and skilled labor we compete with other local regional and national homebuilders often within larger subdivisions designed planned and developed by such homebuilders we also compete with existing home sales foreclosures and rental properties the competitive conditions in the homebuilding industry can result in 

 

  

our financial services business competes with other mortgage lenders including national regional and local mortgage banks and other financial institutions mortgage lenders with greater access to capital or different lending criteria may be able to offer more attractive financing to potential customers 

 

when we are affected by these competitive conditions our business and financial results could be adversely affected in the current downturn in the homebuilding industry the reactions of our competitors may have reduced the effectiveness of our efforts to achieve pricing stability and reduce our inventory levels 

 

we cannot make any assurances that any future growth strategies will be successful or not expose us to additional risks 

 

although we focused on internal growth for several years before the downturn in the homebuilding industry we may make strategic acquisitions of homebuilding companies or their assets in the future successful strategic acquisitions can require the integration of operations and management and other efforts to realize the benefits that may be available although we believe that we have been successful in the past we can give no assurance that we would be able to successfully identify acquire and integrate strategic acquisitions in the future acquisitions can result in the dilution of existing stockholders if we issue our common stock as consideration or reduce our liquidity or increase our debt if we fund them with cash the impact on liquidity may be increased because we do not currently have a revolving credit facility in addition acquisitions can expose us to valuation risks including the risk of writing off goodwill or impairing inventory and other assets related to such acquisitions the risk of goodwill and other asset impairments increases during a cyclical housing downturn when our profitability may decline as evidenced by the goodwill and other asset impairment charges we recognized in recent years in addition we may not be able to implement successfully our operating or internal growth strategies within our existing markets in the uncertain current market conditions asset acquisitions involve a risk that the markets involved subsequently deteriorate conversely if we delay an acquisition until we believe the market uncertainties are resolved the potential competitive advantages of the acquisition may be limited 

 

we may not realize our deferred income tax asset 

 

as of september 30 2009 we have a net deferred income tax asset of 11244 million against which we have provided a valuation allowance of 11244 million the realization of the deferred income tax asset is dependent upon the taxable income available in current statutory carryback periods reversals of existing taxable temporary differences tax planning strategies and our ability to generate taxable income within the statutory carryforward periods based on our assessment the realization of all of our deferred income tax asset 

is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the statutory carryforward periods in which the related temporary differences become deductible 

 

the accounting for deferred income taxes is based upon estimates of future results and the valuation allowance may be increased or decreased as conditions change or if we are unable to implement certain tax planning strategies differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position changes in tax laws also affect actual tax results and the valuation of deferred income tax assets over time 

 

the utilization of our tax losses could be substantially limited if we experienced an ownership change as defined in the internal revenue code 

 

we have experienced continuing losses that have produced net operating losses and unrealized builtin losses for income tax purposes these have the potential to reduce future income tax obligations if we become profitable in the future however section 382 of the internal revenue code contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards and certain builtin losses recognized in years after the ownership change under the rules such an ownership change is generally any change in ownership of more than 50 of its stock within a rolling threeyear period as calculated in accordance with the rules the rules generally operate by focusing on changes in ownership among stockholders considered by the rules as owning directly or indirectly 5 or more of the stock of the company and any change in ownership arising from new issuances of stock by the company 

 

if we undergo an ownership change for purposes of section 382 as a result of future transactions involving our common stock our ability to use any of our net operating loss carryforwards tax credit carryforwards or net unrealized builtin losses at the time of ownership change would be subject to the limitations of section 382 on their use against future taxable income the limitation may affect the amount of our deferred income tax asset and depending on the limitation a significant portion of our builtin losses any net operating loss carryforwards or tax credit carryforwards could expire before we would be able to use them this could adversely affect our financial position results of operations and cash flow 

 

we believe that we have not experienced such an ownership change as of september 30 2009 however the amount by which our ownership may change in the future could be affected by purchases and sales of stock by 5 stockholders and the conversion of our outstanding senior convertible notes over which we have no control and new issuances of stock by us should we choose to do so in august 2009 our board of directors adopted a section 382 rights agreement as a measure intended to deter such an ownership change in order to preserve these tax attributes the section 382 rights agreement however may not prevent an ownership change moreover it will expire by its terms in 2010 if it is not approved when we submit it to our stockholders for their approval in addition while the section 382 rights agreement is in effect it could discourage or prevent a merger tender offer proxy contest or accumulations of substantial blocks of shares for which some stockholders might receive a premium above market value it could also adversely affect the liquidity of the market for our shares

results of operations — fiscal year 2009 overview 

 

during fiscal 2009 conditions within the homebuilding industry remained challenging the decline in demand for new homes continues to be reflected in the volume of our net sales orders which was 20 lower than in fiscal 2008 although our net sales orders in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 were 26 higher than in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 they were 21 and 52 lower than in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and 2006 respectively these results suggest the severe declines in our net sales orders experienced in recent years may be moderating however we expect overall demand for new homes to remain at very low levels for some time and efforts to improve our net sales order volume will be challenging the value of our sales order backlog at september 30 2009 was 5 lower than a year ago 

 

during the slowdown in the homebuilding industry the factors hurting demand for new homes have been pervasive across the united states high inventory levels of available homes elevated cancellation rates low sales absorption rates and overall weak consumer confidence have persisted the effects of these factors have been magnified by reduced availability of credit in the mortgage markets severe shortages of liquidity in the financial markets and high levels of home foreclosures high levels of foreclosures not only contribute to additional inventory available for sale but also reduce appraisal valuations for new homes potentially resulting in lower sales prices the overall economy has weakened significantly and was in a recession during fiscal 2009 marked by high unemployment levels and substantially reduced consumer spending and confidence the turmoil in the housing market during the last three years and the recent weakness in the economy have resulted in drastic price reductions in our homes and continued compression in our gross margins however these price reductions have caused housing to become more affordable which may lead to increased demand in the future when other market conditions improve 

 

we continue to remain cautious regarding our outlook for the homebuilding industry we believe that challenging housing market conditions will persist for some time and that the timing of a sustainable recovery in the housing market remains unclear our outlook incorporates several factors including continued margin pressure from sales price reductions and incentives continued high levels of homes available for sale weak demand from new home consumers the scheduled expiration of the firsttime homebuyer federal tax credit in june 2010 the announced end of the federal reserve system’s open market purchases of mortgagebacked securities in 2010 continued high sales cancellations significant restrictions on the availability of certain mortgage products and increased underwriting requirements for home financing as a result of the continuing constriction of credit in the mortgage markets partially mitigating these negative industry factors are some favorable aspects of our performance in the second half of fiscal 2009 in which our year over year net sales comparisons improved our sales order cancellation rates have declined and we were successful in reducing our inventory of completed homes 

 

due to the challenging market conditions discussed above we have continued to evaluate our homebuilding and financial services assets for recoverability our significant assets excluding cash and those whose recoverability are most impacted by market conditions include inventory earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs related to land and lot option contracts tax assets both on amounts reflected as deferred and as a receivable and owned mortgage loans which collectively comprised 90 of our total noncash assets at september 30 2009 our evaluations reflected our expectation of continued challenges in the homebuilding industry and our belief that these challenging conditions will persist for some time based on our evaluations during fiscal 2009 we recorded inventory impairment charges of 3778 million wroteoff earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs related to land and lot option contracts we no longer plan to pursue of 299 million and recorded additional reserves for losses of 332 million associated with mortgage loans held in portfolio and the limited recourse provisions on previously sold mortgage loans and 149 million related to mortgage reinsurance activities while these impairment charges and writeoffs are less than amounts recognized in each of the prior two years they reflect the continued weakness in market conditions we will evaluate whether further impairment charges valuation adjustments or writeoffs are necessary on these assets in the coming quarters additional discussion of these evaluations and charges is presented below 

strategy 

 

we believe the longterm fundamentals which support housing demand namely population growth and household formation remain positive in the near term however it is not possible to predict how long the negative effects of the current market conditions will persist and if the homebuilding industry will experience further deterioration from these levels or if conditions will begin to improve during the downturn we have aggressively reduced our inventory levels and increased our cash balances we have been successful in generating substantial cash flow from operations primarily through inventory reductions and from the receipt of a tax refund from a loss carryback we have also increased our cash balance by accessing the capital markets while we will continue to conservatively manage our business this increase in our liquidity provides us with flexibility in determining the appropriate operating strategy for each of our communities and markets to strike the best balance between cash flow generation and potential profit with this flexibility we are committed to the following initiatives related to our operating strategy in the current homebuilding business environment 

 

  

these initiatives allowed us to generate significant cash flows from operations during the downturn although we cannot provide any assurances that these initiatives will be successful in the future we expect that our operating strategy will allow us to continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity position in fiscal 2010

fiscal year ended september 30 2009 compared to fiscal year ended september 30 2008 

 

the following tables and related discussion set forth key operating and financial data for our homebuilding operations by reporting segment as of and for the fiscal years ended september 30 2009 and 2008 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

net sales orders 

 

the value of net sales orders decreased 25 to 34984 million 17034 homes in 2009 from 46772 million 21251 homes in 2008 the number of net sales orders decreased 20 in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 we believe the most significant factors contributing to the slowing of demand for new homes in most of our markets include a continued high level of homes for sale which includes foreclosed homes for sale a decrease in the availability of mortgage financing for many potential homebuyers the continued uncertainty in the financial markets and a decline in homebuyer consumer confidence many prospective homebuyers continue to approach the purchase decision tentatively due to concern over their ability to sell an existing home or obtain mortgage financing the general uncertainty surrounding the housing market increasing unemployment and weakness in the overall economy however these factors have led to lower home prices and improved affordability which combined with various homebuyer tax incentives and low mortgage interest rates have served to partially offset some of the market softness we continue to manage our sales incentives and pricing on a community by community basis in an attempt to optimize the 

balance of sales volumes profits returns and cash flows however the factors above combined with the continued pricing responses of our competitors have limited the impact of our pricing efforts on sales 

 

in comparing fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2008 the value of net sales orders decreased in all of our market regions in most market regions these decreases were due to a decrease in the number of homes sold in the respective regions and to a lesser extent to a decline in the average selling price of those homes in the east and southeast regions where decreases in the number of homes sold were not as large as other regions the decline in average selling price was a greater contributor to the decrease in the value of net sales orders 

 

although the volume of our net sales orders decreased 20 in fiscal 2009 much of the decline was attributable to our results in the first half of the year in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009 the volume of our net sales orders decreased by 7 and increased by 26 respectively compared to the same periods of fiscal 2008 we expect our volume of sales orders in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 to improve over the prior year however they will likely decline from the levels achieved in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009 due to seasonal fluctuations and the originally scheduled expiration of the firsttime homebuyer tax credit at november 30 2009 which may have served to accelerate demand in recent periods these results suggest the severe declines in our net sales orders experienced in recent years may be moderating somewhat 

 

the average price of our net sales orders decreased 7 to 205400 in 2009 from 220100 in 2008 the average price of our net sales orders decreased in five of our six market regions due primarily to price reductions and increased incentives implemented to attempt to achieve an appropriate sales absorption pace as the inventory of existing homes for sale which includes a substantial number of foreclosed homes has continued to be high we have adjusted our pricing to remain competitive with comparable existing home sales prices we have also adjusted our product mix geographic mix and pricing within our homebuilding markets in an effort to keep our core product offerings affordable for our target customer base typically firsttime and moveup homebuyers which has also contributed to the decrease in average selling price 

 

our annual sales order cancellation rate cancelled sales orders divided by gross sales orders for the period was 30 in fiscal 2009 compared to 40 in fiscal 2008 while an improvement from the prior year this elevated cancellation rate reflects the ongoing challenges in most of our homebuilding markets including the inability of many prospective homebuyers to sell their existing homes the erosion of buyer confidence and the tight credit conditions in the mortgage markets we anticipate that cancellation rates will remain elevated and may continue to fluctuate significantly until market conditions improve 

 

in july 2008 congress passed and the president signed into law hr 3221 which includes the “american housing rescue and foreclosure prevention act of 2008” among other provisions this law eliminated sellerfunded down payment assistance on fha insured loans approved on or after october 1 2008 of our total home closings in fiscal 2008 approximately 25 were funded with mortgage loans whereby the homebuyer used a sellerfinanced down payment assistance program while we seek other down payment assistance and mortgage financing alternatives for our buyers the elimination of the sellerfinanced down payment assistance programs has had a negative impact on our sales and revenues in fiscal 2009 relative to fiscal 2008 

 

in february 2009 the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 was enacted into law this legislation included a federal tax credit for qualified firsttime homebuyers purchasing a principal residence on or after january 1 2009 and before december 1 2009 in november 2009 this credit was expanded to be available to more homebuyers and extended until june 2010 our sales in future periods may be adversely affected when this tax credit expires 

 

 

 

sales order backlog 

 

sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies including mortgage loan approval and buyers selling their existing homes which can result in cancellations a portion of the contracts in backlog will not result in closings due to cancellations which during the current housing downturn have been substantial at september 30 2009 the value of our backlog of sales orders was 11420 million 5628 homes a decrease of 5 from 12074 million 5297 homes at september 30 2008 the average sales price of homes in backlog was 202900 at september 30 2009 down 11 from the 227900 average at september 30 2008 the yearoveryear increase in home sales activity in the fourth quarter contributed to modest increases in the value of our sales order backlog in four of our six market regions however the value of our backlog decreased significantly in our southwest region particularly in our phoenix market and in our west region particularly in our northern california market 

 

 

 

home sales revenue 

 

revenues from home sales decreased 42 to 35636 million 16703 homes closed in 2009 from 61643 million 26396 homes closed in 2008 the average selling price of homes closed during 2009 was 213400 down 9 from the 233500 average in 2008 in fiscal 2009 home sales revenues decreased significantly in all of our market regions reflecting the continued weak demand and resulting decline in net sales order volume and pricing experienced during the year 

 

the number of homes closed in 2009 decreased 37 due to decreases in all of our market regions as conditions change in the housing markets in which we operate our ongoing level of net sales orders will determine the number of home closings and amount of revenue we will generate 

revenues from home sales in fiscal 2009 and 2008 were increased by 31 million and 268 million respectively from changes in deferred profit the home sales profit related to our mortgage loans held for sale is deferred in instances where a buyer finances a home through our whollyowned mortgage company and has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment the decline in the change in revenues from the prior year is due to the reduced availability of the mortgage types whose use generally resulted in the profit deferral as of september 30 2009 the balance of deferred profit related to such mortgage loans held for sale was 27 million compared to 58 million at september 30 2008 

 

homebuilding operating margin analysis 

 

 

 

home sales gross profit 

 

gross profit from home sales decreased by 32 to 4675 million in 2009 from 6912 million in 2008 and as a percentage of home sales revenues increased 190 basis points to 131 approximately 230 basis points of the increase in the home sales gross profit percentage was a result of the average cost of our homes declining by more than our average selling prices caused by a greater portion of our closings occurring in our south central region which has experienced more stable housing conditions than our other regions and the effects of prior inventory impairments on homes closed during the current year approximately 50 basis points of the increase was due to a decrease in the amortization of capitalized interest and property taxes as a percentage of homes sales revenues resulting from reductions in our interest and property taxes incurred and capitalized over the past year these increases were partially offset by a decrease of 30 basis points due to the recognition of a lesser amount of previously deferred gross profit during the current year compared to the prior year and by 60 basis points due to an increase in actual and estimated warranty and construction defect costs the increase in estimated warranty costs was due in part to a current year adjustment to our estimated warranty liability related to estimated costs to remedy homes which we have found to or suspect may contain allegedly defective drywall manufactured in china chinese drywall in two of our markets also we have experienced increases in our construction defect claims selfinsured retentions resulting in additional reserves for estimated claims 

 

future changes in gross profit percentages are substantially dependent on our future need for the use of sales incentives and price adjustments to generate an adequate volume of home closings and cannot be predicted in the current housing market 

 

land sales revenue and gross profit 

 

land sales revenues decreased 89 to 403 million in 2009 from 3543 million in 2008 of the 403 million of revenues in fiscal 2009 269 million related to land sale transactions in the fourth quarter of 

fiscal 2008 for which recognition of the revenue had been deferred due to the terms of the sale the gross profit percentage from land sales increased to 134 in 2009 from 85 in 2008 the fluctuations in revenues and gross profit percentages from land sales are a function of how we manage our inventory levels in various markets we generally purchase land and lots with the intent to build and sell homes on them however we occasionally purchase land that includes commercially zoned parcels which we typically sell to commercial developers and we also sell residential lots or land parcels to manage our land and lot supply land and lot sales occur at unpredictable intervals and varying degrees of profitability therefore the revenues and gross profit from land sales can fluctuate significantly from period to period during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we sold a significant amount of land and lots through numerous transactions to generate cash flows reduce our future carrying costs and land development obligations and lower our inventory supply in certain markets consummating these transactions during fiscal 2008 allowed us to monetize a large portion of our deferred tax assets through a loss carryback to fiscal 2006 resulting in a substantial tax refund as of september 30 2009 we had 151 million of land held for sale which we expect to sell in the next twelve months

inventory impairments and land option cost writeoffs 

 

during fiscal 2009 when we performed our quarterly inventory impairment analyses the assumptions utilized reflected our cautious outlook for the broader homebuilding industry and our markets both of which impact our business this outlook incorporates our belief that housing market conditions may continue to deteriorate and that challenging conditions will persist our impairment evaluation as of september 30 2009 occurred after the end of the springsummer selling season and was based on our latest operating plans for our projects into fiscal 2010 and reflects the anticipated expiration of government support efforts for the homebuilding industry such as the tax credit and fed purchases of mortgagebacked securities in the coming year accordingly our impairment evaluation as of september 30 2009 again indicated a significant number of communities with impairment indicators communities with a combined carrying value of 9631 million as of september 30 2009 had indicators of potential impairment and were evaluated for impairment the analysis of the large majority of these communities assumed that sales prices in future periods will be equal to or lower than current sales order prices in each community or in comparable communities in order to generate an acceptable absorption rate for a minority of communities that we do not intend to develop or operate in current market conditions slight increases over current sales prices were assumed while it is difficult to determine a timeframe for a given community in the current market conditions we estimated the remaining lives of these communities to range from six months to in excess of ten years through this evaluation process we determined that communities with a carrying value of 4213 million as of september 30 2009 the largest portion of which was in the west region were impaired as a result during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we recorded impairment charges of 1749 million to reduce the carrying value of the impaired communities to their estimated fair value as compared to 9889 million in the same period of the prior year the fourth quarter charges combined with impairment charges recorded earlier in the year resulted in total inventory impairment charges of 3778 million and 23726 million during fiscal 2009 and 2008 respectively in performing our quarterly inventory impairment analyses during fiscal 2009 we utilized a range of discount rates for communities of 14 to 20 which reflects an increase from the range of 12 to 18 we would have used for these communities in fiscal 2008 the increased discount rates reflect our estimate of the increased level of market risk present in the homebuilding and related mortgage lending industries the impact of the increase in the discount rates on the current quarter and fiscal 2009 inventory impairment charges was an increase of 99 million and 189 million respectively 

 

we perform our impairment analysis based on total inventory at the community level when an impairment charge for a community is determined the charge is then allocated to each lot in the community in the same manner as land and development costs are allocated to each lot the inventory within each community is categorized as construction in progress and finished homes residential land and lots developed and under development and land held for development based on the stage of production or plans for future development during fiscal 2009 approximately 85 of the impairment charges were recorded to residential land and lots and land held for development and approximately 15 of the charges were recorded to construction in progress and finished homes inventory compared to 79 and 21 respectively in fiscal 2008 

 

of the remaining 5418 million carrying value of communities with impairment indicators which were determined not to be impaired at september 30 2009 the largest concentrations were in california 21 texas 16 illinois 9 florida 9 and arizona 8 it is possible that our estimate of undiscounted cash flows from these communities may change and could result in a future need to record impairment charges to adjust the carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair value there are several factors which could lead to changes in the estimates of undiscounted future cash flows for a given community the most significant of these include pricing and incentive levels actually realized by the community the rate at which the homes are sold and the costs incurred to construct the homes the pricing and incentive levels are often interrelated with sales pace within a community such that a price reduction can be expected to increase the sales pace further both of these factors are heavily influenced by the competitive pressures facing a given community from both new homes and existing homes which may result from foreclosures if conditions in the broader economy homebuilding industry or specific markets in which we operate worsen beyond current expectations and as we reevaluate specific community pricing and incentives construction and development plans and our overall land sale strategies we may be required to evaluate additional communities or re 

evaluate previously impaired communities for potential impairment these evaluations may result in additional impairment charges 

 

based on our quarterly reviews of land and lot option contracts we have written off earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs related to land and lot option contracts which we no longer plan to pursue during fiscal 2009 and 2008 we wrote off 299 million and 1119 million respectively of earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs related to land option contracts at september 30 2009 outstanding earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs associated with our portfolio of land and lot option purchase contracts totaled 94 million and 81 million respectively the largest concentrations of these balances were in the south central 53 and west 25 regions if the current weak homebuilding market conditions persist and we are unable to successfully renegotiate certain land or lot purchase contracts or our sales volumes do not justify additional land or lot purchases we may write off additional earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs 

 

the inventory impairment charges and writeoffs of earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs reduced total homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding revenues by approximately 1130 basis points in fiscal 2009 compared to 3810 basis points in the fiscal 2008

sga expense from homebuilding activities decreased by 2688 million or 34 to 5230 million in 2009 from 7918 million in 2008 as homebuilding revenues declined at a faster pace than sga expense when expressed as a percentage of homebuilding revenues sga expense increased 240 basis points to 145 in 2009 from 121 in 2008 the largest component of our homebuilding sga expense is employee compensation and related costs which represented 52 and 53 of sga costs in 2009 and 2008 respectively these costs decreased 1457 million or 35 to 2722 million in 2009 from 4179 million in 2008 this decrease was largely due to our continued efforts to align the number of employees to match our current and anticipated home closing levels as well as a decrease in incentive compensation our homebuilding operations employed approximately 2300 and 3100 employees at september 30 2009 and 2008 respectively most other sga cost components also decreased in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 as a result of our efforts to reduce all costs throughout the company the most substantial decreases occurred in advertising and depreciation 

 

we continue to adjust our sga infrastructure to support our expected closings volume however we cannot make assurances that our actions will permit us to maintain or improve upon the current sga expense as a percentage of revenues it becomes more difficult to reduce sga expense as the size of our operations decreases if revenues continue to decrease and we are unable to sufficiently adjust our sga future sga expense as a percentage of revenues may increase further 

 

interest incurred 

 

we capitalize homebuilding interest costs to inventory during active development and construction due to our inventory reduction strategies and slowing or suspending land development in certain communities our inventory under active development and construction “active inventory” has been lower than our debt level and a portion of our interest incurred must be expensed we expensed 957 million of homebuilding interest during fiscal 2009 compared to 390 million of interest during fiscal 2008 since the ratio of our active inventory to debt declined during that period 

 

interest amortized to cost of sales excluding interest written off with inventory impairment charges was 39 of total home and landlot cost of sales in both 2009 and 2008 interest incurred is related to the average level of our homebuilding debt outstanding during the period comparing fiscal 2009 with fiscal 2008 interest incurred related to homebuilding debt decreased 17 to 1968 million primarily due to an 11 decrease in our average homebuilding debt 

gainloss on early retirement of debt 

 

during fiscal 2009 in addition to repaying maturing senior notes we repurchased a total of 3803 million principal amount of various issues of our senior notes prior to their maturity these notes were repurchased primarily through unsolicited transactions for an aggregate purchase price of 3680 million plus accrued interest we recognized a gain of 115 million related to these repurchases which represents the difference between the principal amount of the notes and the aggregate purchase price less any unamortized discounts and fees partially offsetting this gain was a 76 million loss resulting from the writeoff of unamortized fees in connection with the early termination of our revolving credit facility in may 2009 these transactions resulted in a net gain of 39 million during fiscal 2009 

 

the loss on early retirement of debt of 26 million during fiscal 2008 was primarily due to the writeoff of unamortized fees associated with reducing the size of our revolving credit facility in june 2008 

 

other income 

 

other income net of other expenses associated with homebuilding activities was 128 million in 2009 compared to 91 million in 2008 the largest component of other income in both years was interest income 

 

goodwill 

 

in performing our annual impairment analysis as of september 30 2009 we estimated the fair value of our operating segments utilizing the expected present values of future cash flows as a result of this analysis we determined that our goodwill balance of 159 million all of which relates to our south central reporting segment was not impaired based on the estimated fair value of the reporting segment exceeding the carrying value of the reporting segment during fiscal 2008 we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 794 million all of which related to our southwest reporting segment 

 

the goodwill assessment procedures require us to make comprehensive estimates of future revenues and costs due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates actual results could differ from such estimates 

 

homebuilding results by reporting region 

 

 

 

 

  

east region  — homebuilding revenues decreased 41 in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to a 37 decrease in the number of homes closed with the largest decreases in our new jersey and carolina markets the region reported a loss before income taxes of 953 million in 2009 compared to a loss of 3325 million in 2008 the losses were due in part to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and 

preacquisition cost writeoffs totaling 649 million and 2884 million in fiscal 2009 and 2008 respectively the region’s gross profit from home sales as a percentage of home sales revenue home sales gross profit percentage increased 390 basis points in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 the increase was a result of the average cost of our homes declining by more than the average selling prices due to the effects of prior inventory impairments on homes closed during 2009 

 

midwest region  — homebuilding revenues decreased 42 in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to a 40 decrease in the number of homes closed with the largest decreases in our denver market the region reported a loss before income taxes of 1044 million in 2009 compared to a loss of 1843 million in 2008 the losses were due in part to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs totaling 547 million and 1633 million in fiscal 2009 and 2008 respectively the region’s home sales gross profit percentage decreased 540 basis points in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 the decrease was a result of lower margins in our chicago and denver markets as well as higher warranty costs on previously closed homes in our denver market additionally our revenues declined at a greater rate than our sga expense which also contributed to the loss before income taxes in 2009 

 

southeast region  — homebuilding revenues decreased 30 in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to a 20 decrease in the number of homes closed as well as a 12 decrease in the average selling price of those homes the region reported a loss before income taxes of 724 million in 2009 compared to a loss of 5077 million in 2008 the losses were due in part to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs totaling 380 million and 4575 million in fiscal 2009 and 2008 respectively the region’s home sales gross profit percentage increased 340 basis points in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 the increase was a result of the average cost of our homes declining by more than the average selling prices due to the effects of prior inventory impairments on homes closed during 2009 and was partially offset by estimated warranty costs related to homes in one market in florida which we have found to or suspect may contain chinese drywall 

 

south central region  — homebuilding revenues decreased 30 in 2009 compared to 2008 due to a 28 decrease in the number of homes closed the region reported income before income taxes of 61 million in fiscal 2009 compared to a loss before income taxes of 90 million in fiscal 2008 the improvement was due in part to a decrease in inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs which were 200 million and 724 million in fiscal 2009 and 2008 respectively the region’s home sales gross profit percentage increased 50 basis points in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 due to the effects of prior inventory impairments on homes closed during 2009 these improvements were partially offset by our sga expenses decreasing at a slower rate 23 than our homebuilding revenues 

 

southwest region  — homebuilding revenues decreased 66 in 2009 compared to 2008 due to a 60 decrease in the number of homes closed primarily in our phoenix market as well as decreases in the average selling price of homes in the region the region reported a loss before income taxes of 457 million in 2009 compared to a loss of 3667 million in 2008 the losses were due in part to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs totaling 394 million and 3307 million in fiscal 2009 and 2008 respectively in fiscal 2008 goodwill impairment charges of 794 million also contributed to the loss the region’s revenues declined at a greater rate than its sga expense which also contributed to the loss before income taxes in 2009 the region’s home sales gross profit percentage increased 110 basis points in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 due to the effects of prior inventory impairments on homes closed during 2009 

 

west region  — homebuilding revenues decreased 50 in 2009 compared to 2008 due to a 37 decrease in the number of homes closed as well as a 14 decrease in the average selling price of those homes the largest decreases in homes closed occurred in our northern california markets the region reported a loss before income taxes of 2251 million in 2009 compared to a loss of 13 billion in 2008 the losses were due in part to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs totaling 1907 million and 12 billion in fiscal 2009 and 2008 respectively the region’s home sales gross profit percentage increased 450 basis points in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 the increase was a result of the 

average cost of our homes declining by more than the average selling prices due to the effects of prior inventory impairments on homes closed during 2009 

 

fiscal year ended september 30 2008 compared to fiscal year ended september 30 2007 

 

the following tables set forth key operating and financial data for our homebuilding operations by reporting segment as of and for the fiscal years ended september 30 2008 and 2007 we have restated the 2007 amounts between reporting segments to conform to the current year presentation reflecting the change in our reporting segments which occurred in fiscal 2008 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

net sales orders 

 

the value of net sales orders decreased 43 to 46772 million 21251 homes in 2008 from 82306 million 33687 homes in 2007 reflecting the continued reduction of demand for new homes in most homebuilding markets during fiscal 2008 factors that contributed to the slowing of demand included a high level of new and existing homes for sale which included foreclosed homes for sale a decrease in the availability of mortgage financing for many potential homebuyers which was further impacted by the uncertainty in the financial markets and a decline in homebuyer consumer confidence 

 

in comparing fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2007 the value of net sales orders decreased significantly in all six of our market regions these decreases were primarily due to substantially similar decreases in the number of 

homes sold in the respective region particularly in our west region the decline in average selling price also contributed to the decline in the value of net sales orders 

 

the average price of our net sales orders decreased 10 to 220100 in 2008 from 244300 in 2007 the average price of our net sales orders decreased significantly in our west region and to a lesser extent in our midwest and southeast regions due primarily to price reductions and increased incentives in our california las vegas denver and florida markets in general our pricing is dependent on the demand for our homes and declines in our average selling prices during fiscal 2008 were due in large part to increases in the use of price reductions and sales incentives in order to attempt to achieve an appropriate sales absorption pace further as the inventory of existing homes for sale which included an increasing number of foreclosed homes continued to be high it led to the need to ensure our pricing was competitive with comparable existing home sales prices 

 

our annual cancellation rate was 40 in fiscal 2008 compared to 38 in fiscal 2007 our cancellation rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 was 47 which was primarily attributable to cancellations in our southwest region particularly in our arizona markets these elevated cancellation rates reflect the challenges encountered in most of our homebuilding markets including the inability of many prospective homebuyers to sell their existing homes the continued erosion of buyer confidence and further credit tightening in the mortgage markets the impact of the credit tightening became apparent in our cancellation rates in late fiscal 2007 and into fiscal 2008 as the mortgage products many buyers had selected were no longer available or the buyers could no longer qualify due to stricter underwriting guidelines the shortage of liquidity in the financial markets during fiscal 2008 further restricted the availability of credit 

 

 

 

 

sales order backlog 

 

at september 30 2008 the value of our backlog of sales orders was 12074 million 5297 homes a decrease of 55 from 26944 million 10442 homes at september 30 2007 the average sales price of homes in backlog was 227900 at september 30 2008 down 12 from the 258000 average at september 30 2007 the value of our sales order backlog decreased significantly across all of our market regions reflecting the severity and geographic reach of the national housing downturn 

 

 

 

home sales revenue 

 

revenues from home sales decreased 43 to 61643 million 26396 homes closed in 2008 from 107212 million 41370 homes closed in 2007 the average selling price of homes closed during 2008 was 233500 down 10 from 259200 in 2007 during fiscal 2008 home sales revenues decreased significantly in all of our market regions reflecting continued weak demand and the resulting decline in net sales order volume and pricing during the year the number of homes closed in 2008 decreased 36 due to decreases in all of our market regions 

 

revenues from home sales in fiscal 2008 and 2007 were increased by 268 million and 580 million respectively from changes in deferred profit as of september 30 2008 the balance of deferred profit was 58 million compared to 326 million at september 30 2007 the decline was mainly due to the reduced availability of the mortgage types whose use generally resulted in the profit deferral 

 

homebuilding operating margin analysis 

 

 

 

home sales gross profit 

 

gross profit from home sales decreased by 63 to 6912 million in 2008 from 18489 million in 2007 and as a percentage of home sales revenues decreased 600 basis points to 112 the primary factor reducing our home sales gross profit margin was the difficult market conditions discussed above which narrowed the range between our selling prices and costs of our homes in most of our markets causing a 

decline of approximately 430 basis points in home sales gross profit as a percentage of home sales revenues due to the sales environment in many of our markets we offered a variety of incentives and price concessions which affected our gross profit margin by reducing the selling price of the home or increasing the cost of the home without a proportional increase in the selling price we also offered greater discounts and incentives to sell our inventory of completed homes which was at a higher than desired level this strategy helped reduce our completed homes in inventory but also contributed to a decline in our home sales gross profit additionally our home sales gross margin decreased approximately 210 basis points due to an increase in the amortization of capitalized interest and property taxes as a percentage of home sales revenues and 10 basis points due to the recognition of a lesser amount of previously deferred gross profit during 2008 compared to 2007 these decreases were partially offset by an improvement of 50 basis points due to a decrease in warranty and construction defect expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues 

 

land sales revenue and gross profit 

 

land sales revenues decreased 4 to 3543 million in 2008 from 3676 million in 2007 the gross profit percentage from land sales decreased to 85 in 2008 from 229 in 2007 due to the significant decline in demand for new homes we reduced our expectations of future home closing volumes as well as our expected need for land and lots in the future consequently during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we sold a significant amount of land and lots through numerous transactions to generate cash flows reduce our future carrying costs and land development obligations and lower our inventory supply in certain markets consummating these transactions during fiscal 2008 allowed us to monetize a larger portion of our deferred tax assets through a loss carryback to fiscal 2006 resulting in an increase in our expected tax refund the terms of certain of these land and lot sales primarily related to our continuing involvement with the properties resulted in the deferral of the recognition of the sale transaction in some cases consequently 217 million of inventory reflecting its fair value was recorded as a component of inventory not owned

inventory impairments and land option cost writeoffs 

 

during fiscal 2008 when we performed our quarterly inventory impairment analyses the assumptions utilized reflected our outlook for the homebuilding industry and its impact on our business this outlook incorporated our belief that housing market conditions might continue to deteriorate and that these challenging conditions would persist for some time accordingly our impairment evaluation as of september 30 2008 again indicated a significant number of communities with impairment indicators communities with a combined carrying value of 21862 million as of september 30 2008 had indicators of potential impairment and were evaluated for impairment the analysis of each of these communities generally assumed that sales prices in future periods would be equal to or lower than current sales order prices in each community or for comparable communities in order to generate an acceptable absorption rate while it is difficult to determine a timeframe for a given community in the current market conditions we estimated the remaining lives of these communities to range from six months to in excess of ten years through this evaluation process we determined that communities with a carrying value of 9678 million as of september 30 2008 the largest portions of which were in the west and southeast regions were impaired as a result during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we recorded impairment charges of 3647 million to reduce the carrying value of the impaired communities to their estimated fair value 

 

due to the significant decline in demand for new homes we reduced our expectations of future home closing volumes as well as our expected need for land and lots in the future consequently during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we sold a significant amount of land and lots in connection with these land and lot sales we recorded impairment charges of 6242 million to reduce the 8144 million carrying value of this inventory to its net realizable value including impairments related to land sales impairment charges during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 totaled 9889 million as compared to 2783 million in the prior year period the fourth quarter charges combined with impairment charges recorded earlier in the year resulted in total inventory impairment charges of 23726 million and 12222 million during fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively during fiscal 2008 excluding impairments related to land sales approximately 79 of the impairment charges were recorded to residential land and lots and land held for development and approximately 21 of the charges were recorded to residential construction in progress and finished homes inventory compared to 74 and 26 respectively in fiscal 2007 

 

during fiscal 2008 and 2007 we wrote off 1119 million and 1073 million respectively of earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs related to land option purchase contracts which we determined we would not pursue the inventory impairment charges and writeoffs of earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs reduced total homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding revenues by approximately 3810 basis points in fiscal 2008 compared to 1200 basis points in fiscal 2007 

 

selling general and administrative sga expense 

 

sga expense from homebuilding activities decreased by 3497 million or 31 to 7918 million in 2008 from 11415 million in 2007 as a percentage of homebuilding revenues sga expense increased 180 basis points to 121 in 2008 from 103 in 2007 due to a decrease in revenues the largest component of our homebuilding sga expense is employee compensation and related costs which represented 53 and 59 of sga costs in 2008 and 2007 respectively those costs decreased 2542 million or 38 to 4179 million in 2008 from 6722 million in 2007 largely due to our continued efforts to align the number of employees to match our home closing levels as well as a decrease in incentive compensation which is primarily based on profitability our homebuilding operations employed approximately 3100 and 5100 employees at september 30 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

interest incurred 

 

we capitalize homebuilding interest costs to inventory during development and construction during fiscal 2007 our active inventory exceeded our debt levels therefore we capitalized all interest from homebuilding debt however due to our inventory reduction strategies slowing or suspending land development in certain communities and limiting the construction of unsold homes our active inventory was lower than our debt level 

during much of fiscal 2008 as a result we expensed 390 million of homebuilding interest incurred during fiscal 2008 

 

interest amortized to cost of sales excluding interest written off with inventory impairment charges was 39 of total home and landlot cost of sales in 2008 compared to 24 in 2007 the increase in the rate of interest amortized to cost of sales was primarily due to a greater decline in our home closings volume as compared to the decline in our interest incurred during the year and a more rapid reduction in our active inventory levels than our interest incurred over the time period in which fiscal 2008 closings were active versus the prior year closings 

 

interest incurred is directly related to the average level of our homebuilding debt outstanding during the period comparing fiscal 2008 with fiscal 2007 interest incurred related to homebuilding debt decreased by 22 to 2367 million primarily due to a 23 decrease in our average homebuilding debt 

 

loss on early retirement of debt 

 

in fiscal 2008 we recorded a loss on early retirement of debt of 26 million which was primarily due to the writeoff of unamortized fees associated with reducing the size of our revolving credit facility in june 2008 in fiscal 2007 in connection with the early retirement of our 85 senior notes due 2012 we recorded a loss of 121 million for the call premium and the unamortized discount and fees related to the redeemed notes 

 

other income 

 

other income net of other expenses associated with homebuilding activities was 91 million in 2008 compared to 40 million in 2007 the increase in other income in fiscal 2008 was primarily due to an increase in interest income 

 

goodwill impairments 

 

 

 

goodwill 

 

in performing our annual impairment analysis as of september 30 2008 we estimated the fair value of our operating segments utilizing the expected present values of future cash flows as a result of this analysis we determined that our goodwill balance related to each operating segment in our southwest reporting segment was impaired consequently during the fourth quarter we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 794 million as of september 30 2008 our remaining goodwill balance was 159 million all of which related to our south central reporting segment 

 

during fiscal 2007 we recorded goodwill impairment charges of 4741 million primarily related to our west reporting segment as of september 30 2007 allocation of our remaining goodwill balance of 953 million was as follows south central 159 million and southwest 794 million 

homebuilding results by reporting region 

 

 

 

 

  

east region  — homebuilding revenues decreased 46 in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to a 44 decrease in the number of homes closed as well as a slight decrease in the average selling price of those homes the region reported a loss before income taxes of 3325 million in 2008 compared to a loss of 661 million in 2007 the losses were primarily due to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs totaling 2884 million and 815 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively in fiscal 2008 inventory impairment charges included 427 million of impairments related to fourth quarter land sales in fiscal 2007 goodwill impairment charges of 394 million also contributed to the loss a decrease in the region’s gross profit from home sales as a percentage of home sales revenue home sales gross profit percentage of 930 basis points in 2008 compared to 2007 also contributed to the increase in loss before income taxes the home sales gross profit percentage declined in most of the region’s markets many of which had very high sales cancellations resulting in unsold homes we aggressively priced to sell despite implementing significant cost control measures our revenues declined at a greater rate 46 than our sga expense 29 which also contributed to the loss before income taxes in this region 

 

midwest region  — homebuilding revenues decreased 51 in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to a 46 decrease in the number of homes closed as well as a 7 decrease in the average selling price of those homes the region reported a loss before income taxes of 1843 million in 2008 compared to a loss of 2053 million in 2007 the losses were primarily due to a decline in revenues and inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs totaling 1633 million and 1673 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively while the region’s home sales gross profit percentage remained relatively flat in fiscal 2008 inventory impairment charges included 336 million of impairments related to fourth quarter land sales in fiscal 2007 goodwill impairment charges of 485 million also contributed to the loss despite implementing significant cost control measures our revenues declined at a greater rate 51 than our sga expense 31 which also contributed to the loss before income taxes in this region 

 

southeast region  — homebuilding revenues decreased 44 in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to a 41 decrease in the number of homes closed as well as a 9 decrease in the average selling price of those homes the region reported a loss before income taxes of 5077 million in 2008 compared to a loss of 1316 million in 2007 the losses were primarily due to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs totaling 4575 million and 2102 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively in fiscal 2008 inventory impairment charges included 1167 million of impairments related to fourth quarter land sales in fiscal 2007 goodwill impairment charges of 115 million also contributed to the loss a decrease in the region’s home sales gross profit percentage of 990 basis points in 2008 compared to 2007 also contributed to the increase in loss before income taxes the home sales gross profit percentage 

declines in our florida markets had the greatest impact on the overall decreases the florida markets experienced rapid price increases in previous years which encouraged speculation in residential real estate creating an environment that has shown not to be sustainable the tightening in the mortgage environment high cancellation rates and existing homes for sale by investors led to increased inventory levels requiring price reductions and increased levels of sales incentives to compete for the reduced pool of qualified buyers resulting in substantial gross profit declines 

 

south central region  — homebuilding revenues decreased 28 in 2008 compared to 2007 due to a 29 decrease in the number of homes closed the region reported a loss before income taxes of 90 million in 2008 compared to income before income taxes of 1222 million in 2007 the loss in fiscal 2008 was primarily due to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs totaling 724 million in fiscal 2008 compared to 246 million in 2007 in fiscal 2008 inventory impairment charges included 291 million of impairments related to fourth quarter land sales in addition the region’s home sales gross profit percentage decreased 130 basis points in 2008 compared to 2007 the decline in home sales gross profit was largely due to softening in the san antonio market where inventories of new and existing homes had increased resulting in increased levels of sales incentives being offered by builders the majority of the region’s inventory impairment charges were also in the san antonio market 

 

southwest region  — homebuilding revenues decreased 38 in 2008 compared to 2007 due to a 35 decrease in the number of homes closed as well as an 11 decrease in the average selling price of those homes the region reported a loss before income taxes of 3667 million in 2008 compared to income before income taxes of 1929 million in 2007 the loss in fiscal 2008 was primarily due to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs totaling 3307 million compared to 268 million in 2007 in fiscal 2008 inventory impairment charges included 1554 million of impairments related to fourth quarter land sales a decrease in the region’s home sales gross profit percentage of 720 basis points in 2008 compared to 2007 which was largely due to declines in our phoenix market also contributed to the reduction in income before income taxes the phoenix market experienced rapid price increases in previous years which encouraged speculation in residential real estate creating an environment that has shown not to be sustainable the tightening in the mortgage environment high cancellation rates and existing homes for sale by investors led to increased inventory levels requiring price reductions and increased levels of sales incentives to compete for the reduced pool of qualified buyers resulting in substantial gross profit declines the increased number of foreclosed homes offered for sale in phoenix added further pressure to sales prices in fiscal 2008 goodwill impairment charges of 794 million also contributed to the loss 

 

west region  — homebuilding revenues decreased 45 in 2008 compared to 2007 due to a 36 decrease in the number of homes closed as well as a 17 decrease in the average selling price of those homes the region reported a loss before income taxes of 13 billion in 2008 compared to a loss of 9321 million in 2007 the losses were primarily due to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs totaling 12 billion and 8191 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively the majority of the inventory impairments related to communities in our california and las vegas markets in fiscal 2008 inventory impairment charges included 2467 million of impairments related to fourth quarter land sales in fiscal 2007 goodwill impairment charges of 3747 million contributed to the loss in fiscal 2007 a decrease in the region’s home sales gross profit percentage of 920 basis points in 2008 compared to 2007 also contributed to the increase in loss before income taxes although all of the region’s markets have experienced weak market conditions the home sales gross profit percentage decline in our california and las vegas markets had the greatest impact on the overall decreases for the region the california and las vegas markets experienced rapid significant home price increases in previous years which contributed to gross profit increases in 2005 and continued elevated gross profits in 2006 but these price increases also strained housing affordability for many potential homebuyers there credit tightening in the mortgage markets also significantly limited the availability of many mortgage products used extensively by california and las vegas homebuyers in previous years increased levels of sales incentives and home price reductions were typical in these markets as builders attempted to increase demand for homes to reduce high inventory levels and to address affordability concerns resulting in substantial gross profit declines the increased number of foreclosed homes offered for sale in california and las vegas added further pressure to sales prices 

results of operations — financial services 

 

fiscal year ended september 30 2009 compared to fiscal year ended september 30 2008 

 

the following tables set forth key operating and financial data for our financial services operations comprising dhi mortgage and our subsidiary title companies for the fiscal years ended september 30 2009 and 2008 

 

 

 

 

 

financial services operating margin analysis 

 

 

mortgage loan activity 

 

the volume of loans originated and brokered by our mortgage operations is directly related to the number and value of homes closed by our homebuilding operations total firstlien loans originated or brokered by dhi mortgage for our homebuyers decreased by 31 in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 corresponding to the decrease in the number of homes closed of 37 the percentage decrease in loans originated was less than the percentage decrease in homes closed due to an increase in our mortgage capture rate the percentage of total home closings by our homebuilding operations for which dhi mortgage handled the homebuyers’ financing to 67 in 2009 from 61 in 2008 

 

home closings from our homebuilding operations constituted 83 of dhi mortgage loan originations in 2009 compared to 92 in 2008 reflecting dhi mortgage’s continued focus on supporting the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations the relatively lower captive percentage in the current year reflects an increase in refinancing activity as existing homeowners have taken advantage of the recent decline in mortgage interest rates 

 

the number of loans sold to thirdparty purchasers decreased by 22 in 2009 as compared to 2008 the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the number of mortgage loans originated consistent with fiscal 2008 originations during fiscal 2009 continued to predominantly be eligible for sale to fannie mae freddie mac or gnma “agencyeligible” in fiscal 2009 approximately 99 of dhi mortgage production and 98 of mortgage loans held for sale on september 30 2009 were agencyeligible 

 

financial services revenues and expenses 

 

revenues from the financial services segment decreased 58 to 537 million in 2009 from 1275 million in 2008 the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the number of mortgage loans originated and sold as well as an increase in recourse expense related to future loan repurchase obligations which is a component of gains from sale of mortgages and increases in the loss reserves for reinsured loans which is a component of other revenues charges related to recourse obligations were 332 million in fiscal 2009 compared to 219 million in fiscal 2008 the increase in recourse expense is a result of increasing our loan loss reserves during fiscal 2009 due to increased expectations for loan repurchases and related losses caused by additional repurchase requests arising under the limited recourse provisions the calculation of our required repurchase loss reserve is based upon an analysis of repurchase requests received our actual repurchases and losses through the disposition of such discussions with our mortgage purchasers and analysis of the mortgages we originated while we believe that we have adequately reserved for losses on known and projected repurchase requests if actual repurchases or if the losses incurred resolving those repurchases exceed our expectations additional recourse expense may be incurred also a subsidiary of ours reinsured a portion of private mortgage insurance written on loans originated by dhi mortgage in prior years charges to increase reserves for expected losses on the reinsured loans were 149 million and 49 million during fiscal 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

additionally revenues during fiscal 2008 included the recognition of an additional 88 million of revenues related to the adoption of the fasb’s authoritative guidance for written loan commitments which was adopted on january 1 2008 the guidance requires that the expected net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of a loan are included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings at the time of commitment the effect of this guidance in fiscal 2009 was a 43 million decrease in revenues 

 

general and administrative ga expense associated with financial services decreased 22 to 781 million in 2009 from 1001 million in 2008 the largest component of our financial services ga expense is employee compensation and related costs which represented 75 and 71 of ga costs in 2009 and 2008 respectively these costs decreased 18 to 583 million in 2009 from 708 million in 2008 as we have continued to align the number of employees with current and anticipated loan origination and title service levels our financial services operations employed approximately 600 and 700 employees at september 30 2009 and 2008 respectively 

as a percentage of financial services revenues excluding the effects of recourse expense and reinsurance expense ga expense increased to 767 in 2009 from 649 in 2008 the increase was primarily due to the reduction in revenue resulting from the decrease in mortgage loan volume during fiscal 2009 as well as higher revenues in the prior year due to the adoption of the authoritative guidance for written loan commitments fluctuations in financial services ga expense as a percentage of revenues can be expected to occur as some expenses are not directly related to mortgage loan volume or to changes in the amount of revenue earned

financial services operating margin analysis 

 

 

mortgage loan activity 

 

total firstlien loans originated or brokered by dhi mortgage for our homebuyers decreased by 41 in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 corresponding to the decrease in the number of homes closed of 36 the percentage decrease in loans originated was greater than the percentage decrease in homes closed due to a decline in our mortgage capture rate to 61 in 2008 from 66 in 2007 as dhi mortgage reduced the number of homebuilding markets it supports 

 

home closings from our homebuilding operations constituted 92 of dhi mortgage loan originations in 2008 compared to 95 in 2007 reflecting dhi mortgage’s continued focus on supporting the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations the number of loans sold to thirdparty purchasers decreased by 50 in 2008 as compared to 2007 the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the number of mortgage loans originated 

 

during fiscal 2007 the market for certain nontraditional mortgage loans changed substantially resulting in the reduced availability of some loan products that had previously been available to borrowers the affected loan products were generally characterized by high combined loantovalue ratios in combination with less required documentation than traditional mortgage loans such loan products declined substantially as a percentage of total originations during fiscal 2007 primarily in the third and fourth quarters as a percentage of total loans originated originations of traditional conforming conventional loans and fha or va insured loans increased significantly during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 to approximately 90 corresponding to the reduction in nontraditional mortgage loans consistent with the second half of fiscal 2007 originations during fiscal 2008 continued to be predominantly traditional conforming conventional loans and fha or va insured loans 

 

financial services revenues and expenses 

 

revenues from the financial services segment decreased 39 to 1275 million in 2008 from 2077 million in 2007 the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the number of mortgage loans originated and sold although during fiscal 2008 the effect of decreased loan volume was partially offset by the recognition of an additional 88 million of revenues related to the adoption of the fasb’s authoritative guidance for written loan commitments on january 1 2008 additionally we increased our loan loss reserve from 246 million at september 30 2007 to 305 million at september 30 2008 to provide for estimated losses predominantly on loans held in portfolio and loans held for sale charges related to recourse obligations declined to 219 million in fiscal 2008 from 260 million in fiscal 2007 recourse expense is a component of gains from sale of mortgages 

 

ga expense associated with financial services decreased 35 to 1001 million in 2008 from 1538 million in 2007 the largest component of our financial services ga expense is employee compensation and related costs which represented 71 and 75 of ga costs in 2008 and 2007 respectively these costs decreased 38 to 708 million in 2008 from 1149 million in 2007 as we have continued to align the number of employees with current and anticipated loan origination and title service levels our financial services operations employed approximately 700 and 1100 employees at september 30 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

as a percentage of financial services revenues excluding the effects of recourse expense and reinsurance expense ga expense decreased to 649 in 2008 from 658 in 2007 the decrease was primarily due to the effect of the additional revenue recognized upon adopting the authoritative guidance for written loan commitments in fiscal 2008 largely offset by the reduction in revenue resulting from the decrease in mortgage loan volume during fiscal 2008 fluctuations in financial services ga expense as a percentage of revenues can be expected to occur as some expenses are not directly related to mortgage loan volume or to changes in the amount of revenue earned 

 

interest expense is directly related to the average level of our financial services debt outstanding during the period comparing fiscal 2008 with fiscal 2007 interest expense related to financial services debt decreased by 84 to 37 million primarily due to an 87 decrease in our average financial services debt 

interest and other income decreased 70 to 114 million in 2008 from 385 million in 2007 primarily due to the decreased volume of loan originations 

 

results of operations — consolidated 

 

fiscal year ended september 30 2009 compared to fiscal year ended september 30 2008 

 

loss before income taxes 

 

loss before income taxes for fiscal 2009 was 5523 million compared to 26318 million for fiscal 2008 the decrease in our consolidated loss was primarily due to significantly lower inventory impairment charges during fiscal 2009 as well as a decrease in our sga expense these improvements were slightly offset by a decrease in the amount of our home sales gross profit due to a reduction in revenues further deterioration of market conditions in the homebuilding industry and related availability of mortgage financing may further negatively impact our financial results and may also result in further asset impairment charges against income in future periods 

 

income taxes 

 

in fiscal 2009 we recorded a benefit from income taxes of 70 million which relates primarily to adjustments to the tax provision recorded for fiscal year 2008 resulting from the finalization and filing of the tax return for that year in fiscal 2008 we recorded a provision for income taxes of 18 million we do not have meaningful effective tax rates in these years because of losses from operations before taxes the impact of valuation allowances on our net deferred tax assets and impairment of nondeductible goodwill 

 

we had income tax receivables of 2931 million and 6762 million at september 30 2009 and 2008 respectively in december 2008 we received a federal income tax refund of 6217 million with respect to our 2008 year we received 1130 million of the 2931 million receivable in the form of a tax refund during october 2009 a substantial portion of the remaining tax receivable at september 30 2009 is due to the carryback of federal tax losses generated in fiscal 2009 that can be carried back against fiscal 2007 taxable income we also had 111 million of income tax receivables for state operating loss carrybacks at september 30 2009 

 

at september 30 2009 we had a federal net operating loss carryforward of 422 million that will expire in fiscal 2029 and tax benefits for state net operating loss carryforwards of 814 million that expire beginning at various times depending on the tax jurisdiction from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2029 we also had minimum tax credit carryforwards of 176 million that carry no expiration date 

 

at september 30 2009 and 2008 we had net deferred tax assets of 11244 million and 11748 million respectively offset by valuation allowances of 11244 million and 9613 million respectively differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position changes in existing tax laws also affect actual tax results and the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 

 

on november 6 2009 the worker homeownership and business assistance act of 2009 was enacted into law and amended section 172 of the internal revenue code to allow the net operating loss realized in one or the other of tax years 2008 or 2009 our fiscal 2009 or 2010 to be carried back up to five years previously limited to a twoyear carryback we are evaluating the impact of this legislative change we will be able to carry back either fiscal 2009 or 2010 taxable losses five years and receive a refund of previously paid federal income taxes in excess of that recognized in the september 30 2009 consolidated balance sheet we currently anticipate that such additional refund will approximate 200 million and will likely be recognized in our financial statements as a reduction of our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 

 

the benefits of our net operating loss and minimum tax credit carryforwards as well as our unrealized builtin losses would be reduced or potentially eliminated if we experienced an ownership change as defined by internal revenue code section 382 section 382 we do not believe we have experienced such an 

ownership change as of september 30 2009 however the amount by which our ownership may change in the future could be affected by purchases and sales of stock by 5 stockholders and the conversion of our outstanding convertible senior notes over which we have no control in august 2009 our board of directors adopted a section 382 rights agreement as a measure intended to deter such an ownership change in order to preserve these tax attributes the section 382 rights agreement however may not prevent an ownership change moreover it will expire by its terms in 2010 if it is not approved when we submit it to our stockholders for their approval 

 

during fiscal 2009 and 2008 we recognized interest and penalties with respect to income taxes of 30 million and 40 million respectively in our consolidated statements of operations and at september 30 2009 and 2008 our total accrued interest and penalties relating to unrecognized income tax benefits was 62 million and 49 million respectively as of september 30 2009 and 2008 our total unrecognized income tax benefits were 240 million and 187 million respectively unrecognized tax benefits are the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit recognized for accounting purposes the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits includes interest penalties and the tax benefit relating to the deductibility of interest and state income taxes all tax positions if recognized would affect our effective income tax rate we do not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly decrease or increase within twelve months of the current reporting date 

 

we are subject to federal income tax and to income tax in multiple states the statute of limitations for our major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for fiscal years 2006 through 2009 we are currently being audited by various states the irs concluded its examination of our tax returns for 2004 and 2005 in february 2009 which resulted in the assessment of 75 million of additional federal and state income tax and interest 

 

fiscal year ended september 30 2008 compared to fiscal year ended september 30 2007 

 

loss before income taxes 

 

loss before income taxes for fiscal 2008 was 26318 million compared to 9512 million for fiscal 2007 the increase in our consolidated loss was primarily due to significantly higher inventory impairment charges during fiscal 2008 and a decrease in the amount of our home sales gross profit due to a reduction in revenues these improvements were partially offset by decreases in goodwill impairment charges and sga expense during fiscal 2008 

 

income taxes 

 

due to the challenging market conditions in the homebuilding industry we recorded significant impairment charges for both inventory and goodwill during fiscal 2007 and 2008 and were in a threeyear cumulative pretax loss position for fiscal years 2006 through 2008 while we had a long history of profitable operations prior to the downturn in the homebuilding industry the cumulative loss position was significant negative evidence in assessing the recoverability of our deferred tax assets therefore in fiscal 2008 we recorded a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets representing those deferred tax asset amounts for which ultimate realization is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the related temporary differences become deductible 

 

during fiscal 2008 particularly in the fourth quarter we sold a significant amount of land and lots through numerous transactions to generate cash flows reduce our future carrying costs and land development obligations and lower our inventory supply in certain markets to match our expectations of future demand these transactions combined with the results of all of our operations in this difficult housing environment generated a net operating tax loss that was carried back to fiscal 2006 and resulted in a federal income tax refund consequently we recorded a 6762 million federal income tax receivable relating to the net operating loss carryback refund claim at september 30 2008 

 

in fiscal 2008 the provision for income taxes was 18 million which reflects the effect of the establishment of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance as discussed above in fiscal 2007 the benefit from 

income taxes was 2387 million corresponding to the loss before income taxes for the year our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 differs from the statutory rate primarily because of the establishment of the valuation allowance 

 

overview of capital resources and liquidity 

 

we have historically funded our homebuilding and financial services operations with cash flows from operating activities borrowings under our bank credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities in light of the challenging homebuilding market conditions experienced over the past few years we have been operating with a primary focus to generate cash flows through reductions in assets the generation of cash flow has allowed us to increase our liquidity and strengthen our balance sheet and has placed us in a position to be able to invest in market opportunities as they arise we do not expect to generate as much cash from asset reductions in fiscal 2010 as we have in the past three fiscal years depending upon future homebuilding market conditions and our expectations for such we may use a portion of our cash balances to increase our assets we intend to maintain adequate liquidity and balance sheet strength and we will continue to evaluate opportunities to access the capital markets as they become available 

 

at september 30 2009 our ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital was 363 a decrease of 730 basis points from 436 at september 30 2008 net homebuilding debt to total capital consists of homebuilding notes payable net of cash divided by total capital net of cash homebuilding notes payable net of cash plus stockholders’ equity the decrease in our ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital at september 30 2009 as compared with the ratio a year earlier was primarily due to our higher cash balance resulting from generating cash flows from operations and lower debt balance resulting from retiring maturing senior notes and repurchasing senior notes which was partially offset by the decrease in retained earnings our ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital remains within our target operating range of below 45 we believe that our strong balance sheet and liquidity position will allow us to be flexible in reacting to changing market conditions however future periodend net homebuilding debt to total capital ratios may be higher than the 363 ratio achieved at september 30 2009 

 

we believe that the ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital is useful in understanding the leverage employed in our homebuilding operations and comparing us with other homebuilders we exclude the debt of our financial services business because it is separately capitalized and its obligation under its repurchase agreement is substantially collateralized and not guaranteed by our parent company or any of our homebuilding entities because of its capital function we include homebuilding cash as a reduction of our homebuilding debt and total capital for comparison to our ratios of net homebuilding debt to capital above at september 30 2009 and 2008 our ratios of homebuilding debt to total capital without netting cash balances were 587 and 556 respectively 

 

historically we used our 165 billion unsecured revolving credit facility as a partial source of funding for our homebuilding operations however as we have generated substantial cash flows from operations and accumulated a significant cash balance we had not borrowed under the revolving credit facility since january 2008 we had continued to pay fees associated with the unused capacity under the facility since that time despite our expectation that we would not borrow under the facility in the near term additionally the financial covenants and borrowing base arrangement under the revolving credit facility imposed restrictions on our operations and activities in early fiscal 2009 the borrowing base arrangement had limited our additional borrowing capacity to an amount well below the unused capacity and the margin by which we had complied with the tangible net worth covenant had declined in order to modify the financial covenants and achieve more capacity under our borrowing base arrangement an amendment to the facility would have been required based on discussions with the lenders any amendment to the facility would have likely substantially reduced the total amount of the facility and would have possibly required the funding of a cash collateral account while increasing some of the costs associated with the facility consequently in accordance with the provisions of the agreement governing the revolving credit facility we voluntarily terminated the facility in may 2009 

we believe that we will be able to fund our working capital needs for our homebuilding and financial services operations as well as our debt obligations through existing cash resources and the cash flows we currently expect to generate in the near term through the receipt of tax refunds during fiscal 2010 our mortgage repurchase facility and for the longer term the issuance of new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets as market conditions may permit 

 

homebuilding capital resources 

 

cash and cash equivalents  — at september 30 2009 we had available homebuilding cash and cash equivalents of 19 billion 

 

bank credit facility  — in may 2009 we voluntarily terminated our 165 billion unsecured revolving credit facility which had included a 10 billion letter of credit subfacility in accordance with the provisions of the agreement governing the facility there were no cash borrowings and 610 million of standby letters of credit outstanding on the facility at the time of termination as a result of the termination we recognized 76 million of loss on early retirement of debt related to the writeoff of unamortized fees in fiscal 2009 there were no penalties incurred in connection with the early termination of the revolving credit facility concurrent with the termination we entered into secured letter of credit agreements with the three banks that had issued letters of credit under the revolving credit facility the effect of these agreements was to remove the outstanding letters of credit from the facility which required us to deposit cash in an amount approximating the balance of letters of credit outstanding as collateral with the issuing banks at september 30 2009 the amount of cash restricted for this purpose totaled 533 million and is included in homebuilding restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet 

 

the revolving credit facility imposed restrictions on our operations and activities by requiring us to maintain certain levels of leverage tangible net worth and components of inventory as a result of the termination of the facility these restrictions are no longer in effect 

 

recently issued public unsecured debt  — in may 2009 we issued 500 million principal amount of 2 convertible senior notes due may 15 2014 with interest payable semiannually holders of the 2 convertible senior notes may convert all or any portion of their notes at their option at any time prior to maturity the initial conversion rate for the notes is 765697 shares of our common stock per 1000 principal amount of senior notes equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately 1306 per share of our common stock the conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest including any additional interest upon conversion of a 2 senior note we will pay or deliver as the case may be cash shares of our common stock or a combination thereof at our election we may not redeem the notes prior to the maturity date the annual effective interest rate of the notes is 26 after giving effect to the amortization of deferred financing costs 

 

the indentures governing our senior notes and senior subordinated notes impose restrictions on the creation of secured debt and liens at september 30 2009 we were in compliance with all of the limitations and restrictions that form a part of the public debt obligations 

 

shelf registration statements  — we have an automatically effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec in september 2009 registering debt and equity securities which we may issue from time to time in amounts to be determined 

 

financial services capital resources 

 

cash and cash equivalents  — at september 30 2009 the amount of financial services cash and cash equivalents was 345 million 

 

mortgage repurchase facility  — our mortgage subsidiary entered into a mortgage sale and repurchase agreement the “mortgage repurchase facility” on march 28 2008 the mortgage repurchase facility which is accounted for as a secured financing provides financing and liquidity to dhi mortgage by facilitating purchase transactions in which dhi mortgage transfers eligible loans to the counterparties against the transfer of funds by the counterparties thereby becoming purchased loans dhi mortgage then has the right and 

obligation to repurchase the purchased loans upon their sale to thirdparty purchasers in the secondary market or within specified time frames from 45 to 120 days in accordance with the terms of the mortgage repurchase facility on march 5 2009 through an amendment to the repurchase agreement and transfer of the rights of each of the counterparties to one counterparty the capacity of the facility was reduced from 275 million to 75 million with a provision allowing an increase in the capacity to 100 million during the last five business days of a fiscal quarter and the first seven business days of the following fiscal quarter additionally the amendment eliminated the minimum required net income covenant and extended the maturity date of the facility to march 4 2010 on september 23 2009 the repurchase agreement was further amended to increase the capacity of the facility from 75 million to 100 million with a provision allowing an increase in the capacity to 125 million during the last five business days of a fiscal quarter and the first seven business days of the following fiscal quarter 

 

as of september 30 2009 2146 million of mortgage loans held for sale were pledged under the repurchase arrangement with a carrying value of 2130 million dhi mortgage has the option to fund a portion of its repurchase obligations in advance as a result of advance paydowns totaling 1315 million dhi mortgage had an obligation of 687 million outstanding under the mortgage repurchase facility at september 30 2009 at a 45 interest rate 

 

the mortgage repurchase facility is not guaranteed by either dr horton inc or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt the facility contains financial covenants as to the mortgage subsidiary’s minimum required tangible net worth its maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and its minimum required liquidity these covenants are measured and reported monthly at september 30 2009 our mortgage subsidiary was in compliance with all of the conditions and covenants of the mortgage repurchase facility 

 

in the past we have been able to renew or extend our mortgage credit facilities on satisfactory terms prior to their maturities and obtain temporary additional commitments through amendments to the credit agreements during periods of higher than normal volumes of mortgages held for sale the liquidity of our financial services business depends upon its continued ability to renew and extend the mortgage repurchase facility or to obtain other additional financing in sufficient capacities a successful refinancing in the future is not assured 

 

operating cash flow activities 

 

during the year ended september 30 2009 net cash provided by our operating activities was 11 billion compared to 19 billion during the prior year during fiscal 2009 a significant portion of the net cash provided by our operating activities was due to a federal income tax refund of 6217 million resulting from the carryback of our fiscal 2008 net operating loss to fiscal 2006 also we continued to generate cash flows from operations by reducing our inventories during the current year the net cash provided by our operating activities during the past three fiscal years has resulted in substantial liquidity and allows the flexibility to determine the appropriate operating strategy for each of our communities and to take advantage of opportunities in the market while we have substantially slowed our purchases of undeveloped land and our development spending on land we own we are purchasing or contracting to purchase finished lots in many markets in an attempt to drive sales and home closings volume and return to profitability during this effort we also plan to continue to manage our inventories by monitoring the aging of unsold homes and aggressively marketing our unsold completed homes in inventory as we work towards these goals we expect to generate less cash flow from asset reductions than we have over the past three fiscal years depending upon future homebuilding market conditions and our expectations for such we may use a portion of our cash balances to increase our assets 

 

another significant source of operating cash flows in fiscal 2009 was the decrease in mortgage loans held for sale of 1313 million during the year the decrease in mortgage loans held for sale was due to a decrease in the number of loans originated during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we expect to use cash to fund an increase in mortgage loans held for sale in quarters when our homebuilding closings grow however in periods when home closings are flat or decline as compared to prior 

periods or if our mortgage capture rate declines the amount of net cash used may be reduced and we may generate positive cash flows from reductions in the balances of mortgage loans held for sale as we did in fiscal 2009 

 

investing cash flow activities 

 

during fiscal 2009 and 2008 we used 62 million and 66 million respectively to invest in purchases of property and equipment primarily model home furniture and office equipment these purchases are not significant relative to our total assets or cash flows and have declined in recent quarters due to the decrease in the size of our operations additionally the increase in restricted cash was due to the cash collateralization of our outstanding letters of credit during fiscal 2009 

 

financing cash flow activities 

 

in fiscal 2009 the majority of our shortterm financing needs have been funded with cash generated from operations and borrowings available under our financial services credit facility longterm financing needs of our homebuilding operations have been generally funded with the issuance of new senior unsecured debt securities through the public capital markets in may 2009 we issued 500 million principal amount of 2 convertible senior notes due 2014 during fiscal 2009 we repaid the remaining 1552 million principal amount of our 5 senior notes and the remaining 2977 million principal amount of our 8 senior notes which were due in january and february respectively these repayments of public unsecured debt were made from our cash balances on hand also during fiscal 2009 primarily through unsolicited transactions we repurchased a total of 3803 million principal amount of various issues of senior notes for an aggregate purchase price of 3680 million plus accrued interest our homebuilding senior convertible senior and senior subordinated notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our whollyowned subsidiaries other than our financial services subsidiaries and certain insignificant subsidiaries 

 

during fiscal 2009 our board of directors approved four quarterly cash dividends of 00375 per common share the last of which was paid on august 28 2009 to stockholders of record on august 18 2009 during fiscal 2008 cash dividends of 015 per common share were paid in the first and second quarters followed by cash dividends of 0075 in the third and fourth quarters on november 19 2009 our board of directors approved a cash dividend of 00375 per common share payable on december 15 2009 to stockholders of record on december 4 2009 the declaration of future cash dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon among other things future earnings cash flows capital requirements our financial condition and general business conditions 

 

changes in capital structure 

 

in november 2008 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 100 million of our common stock and the repurchase of up to 500 million of debt securities the authorizations are effective from december 1 2008 to november 30 2009 repurchases of senior notes through september 30 2009 reduced the debt repurchase authorization to 2226 million upon expiration of the november 2008 authorization our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 100 million of our common stock and the repurchase of up to 500 million of debt securities the new authorizations are effective from december 1 2009 to november 30 2010 

 

on february 9 2009 the compensation committee of our board of directors granted stock options to our executive officers other officers and certain of our employees and our board of directors granted stock options to our outside directors to purchase approximately 61 million shares of our common stock at a price of 903 per share the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant 

 

in may 2009 we voluntarily terminated our 165 billion unsecured revolving credit facility in accordance with the provisions of the agreement governing the facility 

 

in may 2009 we issued 500 million principal amount of 2 convertible senior notes due may 15 2014 with interest payable semiannually 

in august 2009 to preserve the tax benefits of our net operating losses and unrealized builtin losses our board of directors adopted a rights agreement as a measure intended to deter an ownership change as defined by internal revenue code section 382 on august 19 2009 our board of directors declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each outstanding share of our common stock the dividend was paid on august 31 2009 to stockholders of record on august 31 2009 

 

in october 2009 through unsolicited transactions we repurchased 12 million principal amount of our 975 senior notes due 2010 and 65 million principal amount of our 5625 senior notes due 2016 

 

in fiscal 2008 and 2009 our primary nonoperating uses of our available capital were the repayment of debt dividend payments and the cash collateralization of our outstanding letters of credit we continue to evaluate our alternatives for future nonoperating sources and uses of our available capital including the amounts of debt repayments dividend payments and the level of our cash balances based on market conditions and other circumstances and within the constraints of our balance sheet leverage targets and our liquidity targets 

 

contractual cash obligations commercial commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

our primary contractual cash obligations for our homebuilding and financial services segments are payments under our debt agreements and lease payments under operating leases purchase obligations of our homebuilding segment represent specific performance requirements under lot option purchase agreements that may require us to purchase land contingent upon the land seller meeting certain obligations we expect to fund our contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business through a combination of our existing cash resources cash flows generated from operations renewed or amended mortgage repurchase facilities and if needed or believed advantageous the issuance of new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets as market conditions may permit 

 

our future cash requirements for contractual obligations as of september 30 2009 are presented below 

 

 

 

 

  

at september 30 2009 our homebuilding operations had outstanding letters of credit of 520 million all of which were cash collateralized and surety bonds of 11 billion issued by third parties to secure 

performance under various contracts we expect that our performance obligations secured by these letters of credit and bonds will generally be completed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms when we complete our performance obligations the related letters of credit and bonds are generally released shortly thereafter leaving us with no continuing obligations we have no material thirdparty guarantees 

 

our mortgage subsidiary enters into various commitments related to the lending activities of our mortgage operations further discussion of these commitments is provided in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” under part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts to procure land or lots for the construction of homes lot option contracts enable us to control significant lot positions with limited capital investment and substantially reduce the risks associated with land ownership and development within the land and lot option purchase contracts in force at september 30 2009 there were a limited number of contracts representing 53 million of remaining purchase price subject to specific performance clauses which may require us to purchase the land or lots upon the land sellers meeting their obligations also we consolidated certain variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary with assets of 65 million related to some of our outstanding land and lot option purchase contracts creditors if any of these variable interest entities have no recourse against us additionally we recorded 78 million of land inventory not owned related to some of our outstanding land and lot option purchase contracts that were determined to represent financing arrangements further discussion of our land option contracts is provided in the “land and lot position and homes in inventory” section that follows 

 

land and lot position and homes in inventory 

 

the following is a summary of our land and lot position and homes in inventory at september 30 2009 and 2008 

 

 

 

at september 30 2009 we owned or controlled approximately 116000 lots compared to approximately 125000 lots at september 30 2008 of the 116000 total lots we controlled approximately 26500 lots 23 with a total remaining purchase price of approximately 8642 million through land and lot option purchase contracts with a total of 348 million in earnest money deposits our lots controlled included approximately 8100 optioned lots with a remaining purchase price of approximately 2572 million and secured by deposits totaling 254 million for which we do not expect to exercise our option to purchase the land or lots but the contract has not yet been terminated consequently we have written off the deposits related to these contracts resulting in a net earnest money deposit balance of 94 million at september 30 2009 

 

we had a total of approximately 11600 homes in inventory including approximately 1100 model homes at september 30 2009 compared to approximately 12400 homes in inventory including approximately 1500 

model homes at september 30 2008 of our total homes in inventory approximately 5800 and 6900 were unsold at september 30 2009 and 2008 respectively at september 30 2009 approximately 2200 of our unsold homes were completed of which approximately 800 homes had been completed for more than six months at september 30 2008 approximately 3100 of our unsold homes were completed of which approximately 1100 homes had been completed for more than six months 

 

our current strategy is to take advantage of market opportunities by entering into new finished lot option contracts to purchase finished lots in selected communities in an attempt to increase sales volumes and profitability we plan to continue to manage our inventory of homes under construction by starting construction on unsold homes in certain markets while monitoring the aging of unsold homes and aggressively marketing our unsold completed homes in inventory 

 

seasonality 

 

we have typically experienced seasonal variations in our quarterly operating results and capital requirements prior to the current downturn in the homebuilding industry we generally had more homes under construction closed more homes and had greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year this seasonal activity increased our working capital requirements for our homebuilding operations during the third and fourth fiscal quarters and increased our funding requirements for the mortgages we originated in our financial services segment at the end of these quarters as a result of seasonal activity our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year 

 

in contrast to our typical seasonal results due to the weakness in homebuilding market conditions during the past three years we have incurred consolidated operating losses each quarter since the third quarter of fiscal 2007 during these periods the challenging market conditions caused declines in sales volume pricing and margins that mitigated our historical seasonal variations although we may experience our typical historical seasonal pattern in the future given the current market conditions we can make no assurances as to when or whether this pattern will recur 

 

inflation 

 

we and the homebuilding industry in general may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation primarily because of higher land financing labor and material construction costs in addition higher mortgage interest rates can significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers we attempt to pass through to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices however during periods of soft housing market conditions we may not be able to offset our cost increases with higher selling prices 

 

forwardlooking statements 

 

some of the statements contained in this report as well as in other materials we have filed or will file with the sec statements made by us in periodic press releases and oral statements we make to analysts stockholders and the press in the course of presentations about us may be construed as “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 and the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 forwardlooking statements are based on management’s beliefs as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to management these forwardlooking statements typically include the words “anticipate” “believe” “consider” “estimate” “expect” “forecast” “goal” “intend” “objective” “plan” “predict” “projection” “seek” “strategy” “target” or other words of similar meaning any or all of the forwardlooking statements included in this report and in any other of our reports or public statements may not approximate actual experience and the expectations derived from them may not be realized due to risks uncertainties and other factors as a 

result actual results may differ materially from the expectations or results we discuss in the forwardlooking statements these risks uncertainties and other factors include but are not limited to 

 

  

we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise however any further disclosures made on related subjects in subsequent reports on forms 10k 10q and 8k should be consulted additional information about issues that could lead to material changes in performance and risk factors that have the potential to affect us is contained in item 1a “risk factors” under part i of this annual report on form 10k 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

general  — a comprehensive enumeration of the significant accounting policies of dr horton inc and subsidiaries is presented in note a to the accompanying financial statements as of september 30 2009 and 2008 and for the years ended september 30 2009 2008 and 2007 each of our accounting policies has been chosen based upon current authoritative literature that collectively comprises us generally accepted accounting principles gaap in instances where alternative methods of accounting are permissible under gaap we have chosen the method that most appropriately reflects the nature of our business the results of our operations and our financial condition and have consistently applied those methods over each of the periods presented in the financial statements the audit committee of our board of directors has reviewed and approved the accounting policies selected 

 

use of estimates  — the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ materially from those estimates 

revenue recognition  — we generally recognize homebuilding revenue and related profit at the time of the closing of a sale when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer in situations where the buyer’s financing is originated by dhi mortgage our whollyowned mortgage subsidiary and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment the profit is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a thirdparty purchaser has been completed sales of land are evaluated and profit is deferred until the full accrual method criteria are met we include proceeds from home closings held for our benefit at title companies in homebuilding cash when we execute sales contracts with our homebuyers or when we require advance payment from homebuyers for custom changes upgrades or options related to their homes we record the cash deposits received as liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are canceled we either retain or refund to the homebuyer deposits on canceled sales contracts depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances 

 

we recognize financial services revenues associated with our title operations as closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued both of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed we transfer substantially all underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies to thirdparty insurers origination fees and direct origination costs are deferred and recognized as revenues and expenses respectively along with the associated gains and losses on the sales of the loans when the loans are sold to thirdparty purchasers the expected net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of a loan are included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings at the time of commitment we generally do not retain or service the mortgages that we originate but rather seek to sell the mortgages and related servicing rights to thirdparty purchasers interest income is earned from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold 

 

effective october 1 2008 we adopted the fasb’s authoritative guidance related to the fair value option for financial assets which has been applied to all loans originated on or after october 1 2008 these mortgage loans held for sale are initially recorded at fair value based on either sale commitments or current market quotes and are adjusted for subsequent changes in fair value until the loan is sold while our risk management policies with respect to interest rate risk and fair value changes in mortgage loans held for sale have not changed the effect of this standard alleviated the complex documentation requirements to account for these instruments as designated fair value accounting hedges under the previous authoritative guidance additionally the recognition of net origination costs and fees associated with mortgage loans originated on or after october 1 2008 are no longer deferred until the time of sale there were no required cumulative adjustments to retained earnings because we chose to continue to account for mortgage loans held for sale originated prior to october 1 2008 at the lower of cost or market the implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

some mortgage loans are sold with limited recourse provisions based on historical experience discussions with our mortgage purchasers analysis of the mortgages we originated and current housing and credit market conditions we estimate and record a loss reserve for mortgage loans held in portfolio and mortgage loans held for sale as well as known and projected mortgage loan repurchase requests a 20 increase in the amount of expected mortgage loan repurchases and the expected losses on mortgage loan repurchases would result in an increase of approximately 78 million in our reserve for expected mortgage loan repurchases while a 20 decrease in the amount of expected mortgage loan repurchases and the expected losses on mortgage loan repurchases would result in a decrease of approximately 70 million in our reserve for expected mortgage loan repurchases 

 

inventories and cost of sales  — inventory includes the costs of direct land acquisition land development and home construction capitalized interest real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and home construction applicable direct overhead costs that we incur after development projects or homes are substantially complete such as utilities maintenance and cleaning are charged to sga expense as incurred all indirect overhead costs such as compensation of sales personnel and division and region management advertising and builder’s risk insurance are charged to sga expense as incurred 

 

land and development costs are typically allocated to individual residential lots on a prorata basis and the costs of residential lots are transferred to construction in progress when home construction begins we use 

the specific identification method for the purpose of accumulating home construction costs cost of sales for homes closed includes the specific construction costs of each home and all applicable land acquisition land development and related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each community any changes to the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial home closings in a community are generally allocated on a prorata basis to the remaining homes in the community 

 

when a home is closed we generally have not yet paid and recorded all incurred costs necessary to complete the home each month we record as a liability and as a charge to cost of sales the amount we determine will ultimately be paid related to completed homes that have been closed as of the end of that month we compare our home construction budgets to actual recorded costs to determine the additional costs remaining to be paid on each closed home we monitor the accuracy of each month’s accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on closed homes in subsequent months to the amount previously accrued although actual costs to be paid in the future on previously closed homes could differ from our current accruals historically differences in amounts have not been significant 

 

each quarter we review our inventory for the purpose of determining whether recorded costs and costs required to complete each home or community are recoverable if the review indicates that an impairment loss is required an estimate of the loss is made and recorded to cost of sales in that quarter 

 

land inventory and related communities under development are reviewed for potential writedowns when impairment indicators are present we generally review our inventory at the community level and the inventory within each community may be categorized as land held for development residential land and lots developed and under development and construction in progress and finished homes based on the stage of production or plans for future development a particular community often includes inventory in more than one category in certain situations inventory may be analyzed separately for impairment purposes based on its product type eg single family homes evaluated separately from condominium parcels in reviewing each of our communities we determine if impairment indicators exist on inventory held and used by analyzing a variety of factors including but not limited to the following 

 

  

if indicators of impairment are present for a community we perform an analysis to determine if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts and if so impairment charges are required to be recorded if the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying amounts these estimates of cash flows are significantly impacted by community specific factors including estimates of the amounts and timing of future revenues and estimates of the amount of land development materials and labor costs which in turn may be impacted by the following local market conditions 

 

 62 

 

  

for those assets deemed to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets our determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams when an impairment charge for a community is determined the charge is then allocated to each lot in the community in the same manner as land and development costs are allocated to each lot the inventory within each community is categorized as construction in progress and finished homes residential land and lots developed and under development and land held for development based on the stage of production or plans for future development 

 

we generally do not purchase land for resale however when we own land or communities under development that no longer fit into our development and construction plans and we determine that the best use of the asset is the sale of the asset the project is accounted for as land held for sale assuming the land held for sale criteria are met we record land held for sale at the lesser of its carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell in performing impairment evaluation for land held for sale we consider several factors including but not limited to prices for land in recent comparable sales transactions market analysis studies which include the estimated price a willing buyer would pay for the land and recent legitimate offers received if the estimated fair value less costs to sell an asset is less than the current carrying value the asset is written down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell 

 

impairment charges are also recorded on finished homes in substantially completed communities when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values are greater than the fair values less estimated costs to sell these homes 

 

the key assumptions relating to the valuations are impacted by local market economic conditions and the actions of competitors and are inherently uncertain due to uncertainties in the estimation process actual results could differ from such estimates our quarterly assessments reflect management’s estimates and we continue to monitor the fair value of heldforsale assets through the disposition date 

 

land and lot option purchase contracts  — in the ordinary course of our homebuilding business we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts to procure land or lots for the construction of homes under these contracts we will fund a stated deposit in consideration for the right but not the obligation to purchase land or lots at a future point in time with predetermined terms under the terms of the option purchase contracts many of our option deposits are not refundable at our discretion 

 

option deposits and preacquisition costs we incur related to our land and lot option purchase contracts are capitalized if all of the following conditions have been met 1 the costs are directly identifiable with the specific property 2 the costs would be capitalized if the property were already acquired and 3 acquisition of the property is probable meaning we are actively seeking and have the ability to acquire the property and there is no indication that the property is not available for sale we also consider the following when determining if the acquisition of the property is probable 1 changes in market conditions subsequent to contracting for the purchase of the land 2 current contract terms including per lot price and required purchase dates and 3 our current land position in the given market or submarket option deposits and capitalized preacquisition costs are expensed to cost of sales when we believe it is probable that we will no longer acquire the land or lots under option and will not be able to recover these costs through other means 

 

we also evaluate our land and lot option purchase contracts for the financial accounting and reporting of interests in certain variable interest entities which are defined as certain business entities that either have equity investors with voting rights disproportionate to their ownership interests or have equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entities to support their activities the guidance requires consolidation of such entities by any company that is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the entities’ activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entities’ residual returns or both defined as the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity 

 

certain of our option purchase contracts result in the creation of a variable interest in the entity holding the land parcel under option we evaluate those land and lot option purchase contracts with variable interest 

entities to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary based upon analysis of the variability of the expected gains and losses of the entity the expected gains and losses are primarily determined by the amount of deposit required by the contract the time period or term of the contract and by analyzing the volatility in home sales prices as well as development and entitlement risk in each specific market based on this evaluation if we are the primary beneficiary of an entity with which we have entered into a land or lot option purchase contract the variable interest entity is consolidated 

 

since we own no equity interest in any of the unaffiliated variable interest entities that we must consolidate we generally have little or no control or influence over the operations of these entities or their owners when our requests for financial information are denied by the land sellers certain assumptions about the assets and liabilities of such entities are required in most cases the fair value of the assets of the consolidated entities has been assumed to be the remaining contractual purchase price of the land or lots we are purchasing in these cases it is assumed that the entities have no debt obligations and the only asset recorded is the land or lots we have the option to buy with a related offset to minority interest for the assumed thirdparty investment in the variable interest entity creditors if any of these variable interest entities have no recourse against us 

 

fair value measurements  — effective october 1 2008 we adopted the fasb’s authoritative guidance for fair value measurements of certain financial instruments the guidance defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements fair value is defined as the exchange exit price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date this guidance establishes a threelevel hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability observable inputs are those which can be easily seen by market participants while unobservable inputs are generally developed internally utilizing management’s estimates and assumptions 

 

  

when available we use quoted market prices in active markets to determine fair value we consider the principal market and nonperformance risk associated with our counterparties when determining the fair value measurements fair value measurements are used for irlcs mortgage loans held for sale other mortgage loans and hedging instruments 

 

goodwill  — goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over net assets acquired we test goodwill for potential impairment annually as of september 30 or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the remaining balance of goodwill may not be recoverable in analyzing the potential impairment of goodwill the guidance prescribes a twostep process that begins with the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units the fair value is estimated primarily utilizing the present values of expected future cash flows if the results of the first step indicate that impairment potentially exists the second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment if any impairment is determined to exist when the estimated fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value 

 

warranty costs  — we typically provide our homebuyers with a tenyear limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems a twoyear limited warranty on major mechanical systems and a oneyear limited warranty on other construction components since we subcontract our homebuilding work to subcontractors who typically provide us with an indemnity and a certificate of insurance prior to receiving payments for their work claims relating to workmanship and materials are generally the primary responsibility of the subcontractors warranty liabilities have been 

established by charging cost of sales for each home delivered the amounts charged are based on management’s estimate of expected warrantyrelated costs under all unexpired warranty obligation periods our warranty liability is based upon historical warranty cost experience in each market in which we operate and is adjusted as appropriate to reflect qualitative risks associated with the types of homes we build and the geographic areas in which we build them actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts a 10 change in the historical warranty rates used to estimate our warranty accrual would not result in a material change in our accrual 

 

insurance claim costs and selfinsurance  — we have and require the majority of the subcontractors we use to have general liability insurance which includes construction defect coverage our general liability insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from construction defect and other claims and lawsuits subject to selfinsured retentions and other coverage limits for policy years ended june 30 2004 through 2009 we are selfinsured for up to 225 million of the aggregate claims incurred at which point our excess loss insurance begins depending on the policy year once we have satisfied the annual aggregate limits we are selfinsured for the first 10000 to 15 million for each claim occurrence depending on the policy year for policy years 2009 and 2010 we are selfinsured for up to 225 million and 200 million respectively of the aggregate claims incurred and for up to 05 million of each claim occurrence thereafter 

 

in some states where we believe it is too difficult or expensive for our subcontractors to obtain general liability insurance we have waived our traditional subcontractor general liability insurance requirements to obtain lower costs from subcontractors in these states we purchase insurance policies from either thirdparty carriers or our whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary that provide coverage to us and names certain subcontractors as additional insureds the policies issued by our captive insurance subsidiary represent self insurance of these risks by us however for policy years after april 2007 the captive insurance subsidiary has acquired 150 million of reinsurance coverage for the annual loss exposure in excess of 100 million with a thirdparty insurer 

 

also we are selfinsured for the deductible amounts under our workers’ compensation insurance policies the deductibles vary by policy year but in no years exceed 05 million per occurrence the deductible for the 2009 and 2010 policy years is 05 million per occurrence 

 

we record expenses and liabilities related to the costs for exposures related to workers’ compensation construction defects and claims and lawsuits incurred in the ordinary course of business including employment matters personal injury claims land development issues and contract disputes also we record expenses and liabilities for any estimated costs of potential construction defect claims and lawsuits including expected legal costs based on an analysis of our historical claims which includes an estimate of construction defect claims incurred but not yet reported related to the exposures for actual construction defect claims and estimates of construction defect claims incurred but not yet reported and other legal claims and lawsuits incurred in the ordinary course of business we estimate and record insurance receivables for these matters under applicable insurance policies when recovery is probable additionally we may have the ability to recover a portion of our legal expenses from our subcontractors when we have been named as an additional insured on their insurance policies the expenses liabilities and receivables are subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends in construction defect claims relative to our markets and the types of products we build claim settlement patterns insurance industry practices and legal interpretations among others a 10 increase in the claim rate and the average cost per claim used to estimate the selfinsured accruals would result in an increase of approximately 1287 million in our accrual and a 624 million increase in our receivable resulting in additional expense of 663 million while a 10 decrease in the claim rate and the average cost per claim would result in a decrease of approximately 932 million in our accrual and a 614 million decrease in our receivable resulting in a reduction in our expense of 318 million 

 

income taxes  — we calculate a provision for or benefit from income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse a reduction in the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a 

valuation allowance is required if based on the available evidence it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized accordingly we periodically assess the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets based on the morelikelythannot realization threshold criterion in the assessment for a valuation allowance appropriate consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets this assessment considers among other matters the taxable income available in current statutory carryback periods reversals of existing taxable temporary differences tax planning strategies the nature frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses the duration of statutory carryforward periods our historical experience in generating operating profits and expectations for future profitability in making such judgments significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified a cumulative loss in recent years is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable and also restricts the amount of reliance on projections of future taxable income to support the recovery of deferred tax assets the accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position changes in existing tax laws also affect actual tax results and the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 

 

interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in the financial statements as a component of the income tax provision significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions we evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis our evaluations are based upon a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change 

 

stockbased compensation  — from time to time the compensation committee of our board of directors authorizes the issuance of options to purchase our common stock to employees and directors the committee approves grants only out of amounts remaining available for grant from amounts formally authorized by our common stockholders we typically grant approved options with exercise prices equal to the market price of our common stock on the date of the option grant the majority of the options granted vest ratably over a tenyear period 

 

we measure and recognize compensation expense at an amount equal to the fair value of sharebased payments granted under compensation arrangements for all awards granted or modified after october 1 2005 using the modified prospective method compensation expense for any unvested stock option awards outstanding as of october 1 2005 is recognized on a straightline basis over the remaining vesting period we calculate the fair value of stock options using the blackscholes option pricing model determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions which involve a number of variables these variables include but are not limited to the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards the expected dividend yield and expected stock option exercise behavior in addition we also use judgment in estimating the number of sharebased awards that are expected to be forfeited

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

we are subject to interest rate risk on our longterm debt we monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and utilize both fixed and variable rate debt for fixed rate debt changes in interest rates generally affect the value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows conversely for variable rate debt changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument but may affect our future earnings and cash flows we generally do not have an obligation to prepay fixedrate debt prior to maturity and as a result interest rate risk and changes in fair value would not have a significant impact on our cash flows related to our fixedrate debt until such time as we are required to refinance repurchase or repay such debt 

 

we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with our mortgage loan origination services we manage interest rate risk through the use of forward sales of mortgagebacked securities mbs eurodollar futures contracts edfc and put options on mbs and edfc use of the term “hedging instruments” in the following discussion refers to these securities collectively or in any combination we do not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 

 

interest rate lock commitments irlcs are extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and who meet defined credit and underwriting criteria typically the irlcs have a duration of less than six months some irlcs are committed immediately to a specific purchaser through the use of bestefforts whole loan delivery commitments while other irlcs are funded prior to being committed to thirdparty purchasers the hedging instruments related to irlcs are classified and accounted for as derivative instruments in an economic hedge with gains and losses recognized in current earnings hedging instruments related to funded uncommitted loans are accounted for at fair value with changes recognized in current earnings along with changes in the fair value of the funded uncommitted loans the fair value change related to the hedging instruments generally offsets the fair value change in the uncommitted loans and the fair value change which for the year ended september 30 2009 was not significant is recognized in current earnings prior to october 1 2008 the effectiveness of the fair value hedge was monitored and any ineffectiveness which for the years ended september 30 2008 and 2007 was not significant was recognized in current earnings at september 30 2009 hedging instruments used to mitigate interest rate risk related to uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale and uncommitted irlcs totaled 2793 million uncommitted irlcs the duration of which are generally less than six months totaled approximately 2679 million and uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale totaled approximately 455 million at september 30 2009 

 

at september 30 2009 we had 275 million in edfc options and mbs which were acquired as part of a program to potentially offer homebuyers a below market interest rate on their home financing these hedging instruments and the related commitments are accounted for at fair value with gains and losses recognized in current earnings these gains and losses for the years ended september 30 2009 2008 and 2007 were not material 

 

the following table sets forth principal cash flows by scheduled maturity weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value of our debt obligations as of september 30 2009 the interest rate for our variable 

rate debt represents the interest rate on our mortgage repurchase facility because the mortgage repurchase facility is effectively secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale which are typically sold within 60 days its outstanding balance is included as a variable rate maturity in the most current period presented

 item 1 business tableend  

dr horton inc is the largest homebuilding company in the united states based on homes closed during the twelve months ended september 30 2008 we construct and sell high quality homes through our operating divisions in 27 states and 77 metropolitan markets of the united states primarily under the name of dr horton america’s builder we are a fortune 500 company and our common stock is included in the sp 500 index and listed on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol “dhi” unless the context otherwise requires the terms “dr horton” the “company” “we” and “our” used herein refer to dr horton inc a delaware corporation and its predecessors and subsidiaries 

 

donald r horton began our homebuilding business in 1978 in 1991 we were incorporated in delaware to acquire the assets and businesses of our predecessor companies which were residential home construction and development companies owned or controlled by mr horton in 1992 we completed our initial public offering of our common stock the growth of our company over the years was achieved by investing available capital into our existing homebuilding markets and into startup operations in new markets additionally we acquired numerous other homebuilding companies which strengthened our market position in existing markets and expanded our geographic presence and product offerings in other markets our homes generally range in size from 1000 to 5000 square feet and in price from 90000 to 900000 the current downturn in our industry has resulted in a decrease in the size of our operations during fiscal 2007 and 2008 as we have been affected by and have reacted to the significantly weakened market for new homes for the year ended september 30 2008 we closed 26396 homes with an average closing sales price of approximately 233500 

 

through our financial services operations we provide mortgage financing and title agency services to homebuyers in many of our homebuilding markets dhi mortgage our whollyowned subsidiary provides mortgage financing services principally to purchasers of homes we build we generally do not seek to retain or service the mortgages we originate but rather seek to sell the mortgages and related servicing rights to investors our subsidiary title companies serve as title insurance agents by providing title insurance policies examination and closing services primarily to the purchasers of our homes 

 

our financial reporting segments consist of six homebuilding segments and a financial services segment our homebuilding operations are by far the most substantial part of our business comprising approximately 98 of consolidated revenues which were 66 billion in fiscal 2008 our homebuilding operations generate most of their revenues from the sale of completed homes with a lesser amount from the sale of land and lots in addition to building traditional singlefamily detached homes we also build attached homes such as town homes duplexes triplexes and condominiums including some midrise buildings which share common walls and roofs the sale of detached homes generated approximately 77 81 and 80 of home sales revenues in fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively our financial services segment generates its revenues from originating and selling mortgages and collecting fees for title insurance agency and closing services 

 

we make available as soon as reasonably practicable on our internet website all of our reports required to be filed with the securities and exchange commission sec these reports include our annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k beneficial ownership reports on forms 3 4 and 5 proxy statements and amendments to such reports these reports may be accessed by going to our internet website and clicking on the “investor relations” link we will also provide these reports in electronic or paper format to our stockholders free of charge upon request made to our investor relations department information on our internet website is not part of this annual report on form 10k our sec filings are also available to the public over the internet at the sec’s website at wwwsecgov and the public may read and copy any document we file at the sec’s public reference room located at 100 f street ne washington dc 20549 please call the sec at 1800sec0330 for further information on the operation of the public reference room 

 

our principal executive offices are located at 301 commerce street suite 500 fort worth texas 76102 our telephone number is 817 3908200 and our internet website address is wwwdrhortoncom 

operating strategy 

 

for the greatest part of our company’s existence we maintained significant yearoveryear growth and profitability we achieved this growth through an operating strategy focused on capturing greater market share while also maintaining a strong balance sheet to execute our strategy we invested available capital in our existing homebuilding markets and opportunistically entered new markets we also actively evaluated homebuilding acquisition opportunities as they arose some of which resulted in acquisitions and contributed to our growth 

 

due to the progressive weakening of demand in our homebuilding markets over the past few years we have experienced declines in revenues and gross profit sustained significant asset impairment charges and incurred losses in fiscal 2007 and 2008 although we believe the longterm fundamentals which support housing demand namely population growth and household formation remain solid and the current negative conditions will moderate over time the timing of a recovery in the housing market is unclear consequently our primary focus while market conditions are weak is to strengthen our financial condition by reducing inventories of homes and land controlling and reducing construction and overhead costs generating positive cash flows from operations reducing outstanding debt and maintaining strong liquidity 

 

geographic diversity 

 

from 1978 to late 1987 our homebuilding activities were conducted in the dallasfort worth area we then began diversifying geographically by entering additional markets both through startup operations and acquisitions we now operate in 27 states and 77 markets this provides us with geographic diversification in our homebuilding inventory investments and our sources of revenues and earnings we believe our diversification strategy helps to mitigate the effects of local and regional economic cycles and enhances our longterm potential 

 

economies of scale 

 

we are the largest homebuilding company in the united states in terms of number of homes closed in fiscal 2008 by the same measure we are also either the largest or one of the five largest builders in many of our markets in fiscal 2008 we believe that our national regional and local scale of operations has provided us with benefits that may not be available in the same degree to some other smaller homebuilders such as 

 

  

decentralized operations 

 

we decentralize our homebuilding activities to give operating flexibility to our local division presidents on certain key operating decisions at september 30 2008 we had 34 separate homebuilding operating divisions some of which operate in more than one market area generally each operating division consists of a division president land entitlement acquisition and development personnel a sales manager and sales personnel a construction manager and construction superintendents customer service personnel a controller a purchasing manager and office staff we believe that division presidents and their management teams who are familiar with local conditions generally have better information on which to base decisions regarding local operations our division presidents receive performance bonuses based upon achieving targeted financial and operational measures in their operating divisions 

operating division responsibilities 

 

each operating division is responsible for 

 

  

— a feasibility study 

 

— soil and environmental reviews 

 

— review of existing zoning and other governmental requirements and 

 

— review of the need for and extent of offsite work required to meet local building codes 

 

  

centralized controls 

 

we centralize the key risk elements of our homebuilding business through our regional and corporate offices we have four separate homebuilding regional offices generally each regional office consists of a region president legal counsel a chief financial officer a purchasing manager and limited office support staff each of our region presidents and their management teams are responsible for oversight of the operations of up to nine homebuilding operating divisions including 

 

  

our corporate executives and corporate office departments are responsible for establishing our operational policies and internal control standards and for monitoring compliance with established policies and controls throughout our operations the corporate office also has primary responsibility for direct management of certain key risk elements and initiatives through the following centralized functions 

 

 3 

 

  

cost management 

 

we control our overhead costs by centralizing certain administrative and accounting functions and by closely monitoring the number of administrative personnel and management positions in our operating divisions as well as in our regional and corporate offices we also minimize advertising costs by participating in promotional activities sponsored by local real estate brokers 

 

we control construction costs by striving to design our homes efficiently and by obtaining competitive bids for construction materials and labor we also negotiate favorable pricing from our primary subcontractors and suppliers based on the volume of services and products we purchase from them on a local regional and national basis we monitor our construction costs on each house through our purchasing and construction budgeting systems and we monitor our inventory levels margins returns and expenses through our management information systems 

 

acquisitions 

 

as negative market conditions in the housing industry persist we remain focused on strengthening our balance sheet and maintaining strong liquidity however we will continue to evaluate opportunities for strategic acquisitions we believe that the current housing industry downturn may provide us selected opportunities to enhance our operations through the acquisition of existing homebuilding companies at attractive valuations in certain instances such acquisitions can provide us benefits not found in startup operations such as established land positions and inventories and existing relationships with municipalities land owners developers subcontractors and suppliers we seek to limit the risks associated with acquiring other companies by conducting extensive operational financial and legal due diligence on each acquisition and by only acquiring homebuilding companies that we believe will have a positive impact on our earnings within an acceptable period of time 

markets 

 

we conduct our homebuilding operations in all of the geographic regions states and markets listed below and we conduct our mortgage and title operations in many of these markets our homebuilding operating divisions are aggregated into six reporting segments which are comprised of the markets below our financial statements contain additional information regarding segment performance 

 

 

 

 

when evaluating new or existing homebuilding markets for purposes of capital allocation we consider the following local marketspecific factors among others 

 

  

land policies 

 

typically we acquire land after we have completed appropriate due diligence and generally after we have obtained the rights “entitlements” to begin development or construction work resulting in an acceptable number of residential lots before we acquire lots or tracts of land we will among other things complete a feasibility study which includes soil tests independent environmental studies and other engineering work and evaluate the status of necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements required to develop and use the property for home construction although we purchase and develop land primarily to support our homebuilding activities we also sell land and lots to other developers and homebuilders where we have excess land and lot positions in line with our current initiative to reduce land and lot supply to match our future expectations of closings we completed a significant number of land and lot sales during fiscal 2008 particularly in the fourth quarter in addition to generating cash flows reducing our future carrying costs and land development obligations and lowering our inventory supply in certain markets consummating these transactions during the current fiscal year allowed us to monetize a larger portion of our deferred tax assets through a loss carryback to fiscal 2006 resulting in an increase in our expected tax refund 

 

we also enter into landlot option contracts in which we obtain the right but generally not the obligation to buy land or lots at predetermined prices on a defined schedule commensurate with anticipated home closings or planned land development our option contracts generally are nonrecourse which limits our financial exposure to our earnest money deposited with land and lot sellers and any preacquisition due diligence costs incurred by us this enables us to control land and lot positions with limited capital investment which substantially reduces the risks associated with land ownership and development 

 

almost all of our land and lot positions are acquired directly by us we have avoided entering into joint venture arrangements due to their increased costs and complexity as well as the loss of operational control inherent in such arrangements we are a party to a very small number of joint ventures that were acquired through acquisitions of other homebuilders all of these joint ventures are consolidated in our financial statements 

 

we attempt to mitigate our exposure to real estate inventory risks by 

 

 6 

 

  

the benefits of this strategy have been limited by the current deteriorating conditions in the homebuilding industry 

 

construction 

 

our home designs are selected or prepared in each of our markets to appeal to local tastes and preferences of homebuyers in each community we also offer optional interior and exterior features to allow homebuyers to enhance the basic home design and to allow us to generate additional revenues from each home sold in some markets we have adjusted our product offerings to address affordability issues which have become increasingly important in the current weak market conditions 

 

substantially all of our construction work is performed by subcontractors subcontractors typically are retained for a specific subdivision pursuant to a contract that obligates the subcontractor to complete construction at an agreedupon price agreements with the subcontractors and suppliers we use generally are negotiated for each subdivision we compete with other homebuilders for qualified subcontractors raw materials and lots in the markets where we operate we employ construction superintendents to monitor homes under construction participate in major design and building decisions coordinate the activities of subcontractors and suppliers review the work of subcontractors for quality and cost controls and monitor compliance with zoning and building codes in addition our construction superintendents play a significant role in working with our homebuyers by assisting with option selection and home modification decisions educating buyers on the construction process and instructing buyers on postclosing home maintenance 

 

construction time for our homes depends on the weather availability of labor materials and supplies size of the home and other factors we typically complete the construction of a home within four to six months 

 

we typically do not maintain significant inventories of construction materials except for work in progress materials for homes under construction generally the construction materials used in our operations are readily available from numerous sources we have contracts exceeding one year with certain suppliers of our building materials that are cancelable at our option with a 30 day notice in recent years we have not experienced delays in construction due to shortages of materials or labor that have materially affected our consolidated operating results 

 

marketing and sales 

 

we market and sell our homes through commissioned employees and independent real estate brokers we typically conduct home sales from sales offices located in furnished model homes in each subdivision and we typically do not offer our model homes for sale until the completion of a subdivision our sales personnel assist prospective homebuyers by providing them with floor plans price information tours of model homes and assisting them with the selection of options and other custom features we train and inform our sales personnel as to the availability of financing construction schedules and marketing and advertising plans as our customers are typically firsttime or moveup homebuyers we attempt to adjust our product mix and pricing within our homebuilding markets to keep our homes affordable as market conditions warrant we may provide potential homebuyers with one or more of a variety of incentives including discounts and free upgrades to be competitive in a particular market in the current weak market conditions we have significantly increased the level of incentives we are offering to homebuyers in most markets 

we advertise in our local markets as necessary through newspapers marketing brochures and newsletters we also use billboards radio and television advertising and our internet website to market the location price range and availability of our homes to minimize advertising costs we attempt to operate in subdivisions in conspicuous locations that permit us to take advantage of local traffic patterns we also believe that model homes play a substantial role in our marketing efforts so we expend significant effort to create an attractive atmosphere in our model homes 

 

in addition to using model homes in selected markets and projects we build a limited number of speculative homes in each subdivision these homes enhance our marketing and sales efforts to prospective homebuyers who are relocating to these markets as well as to independent brokers who often represent homebuyers requiring a completed home within 60 days we determine our speculative homes strategy in each market based on local market factors such as new job growth the number of job relocations housing demand seasonality current sales contract cancellation trends and our past experience in the market we determine the number of speculative homes to build in each subdivision based on our current and planned sales pace and we monitor and adjust speculative homes inventory on an ongoing basis as conditions warrant we typically have sold a substantial majority of our speculative homes while they are under construction or soon after completion however the significant weakness in our housing markets and related high cancellation rates during fiscal 2006 2007 and 2008 have caused our speculative homes inventory to remain higher than our target levels while we plan to reduce both total and speculative homes in inventory from current levels we do expect to maintain a level of speculative home inventory in our markets which will be based on our expectations of future sales and closings volume we believe these speculative homes help to provide us with opportunities to sell additional homes reduce our inventory of developed lots and generate positive cash flows 

 

our sales contracts require an earnest money deposit of at least 500 the amount of earnest money required varies between markets and subdivisions and may significantly exceed 500 additionally customers are generally required to pay additional deposits when they select options or upgrade features for their homes most of our sales contracts stipulate that when customers cancel their contracts with us we have the right to retain their earnest money and option deposits however our operating divisions occasionally choose to refund such deposits our sales contracts also include a financing contingency which permits customers to cancel and receive a refund of their deposits if they cannot obtain mortgage financing at prevailing or specified interest rates within a specified period our contracts may include other contingencies such as the sale of an existing home as a percentage of gross sales orders cancellations of sales contracts in fiscal 2008 were 40 our cancellation rate continues to be significantly higher than our historical rate of approximately 20 before the downturn in the homebuilding industry reflecting the continuing weak housing market conditions the length of time between the signing of a sales contract for a home and delivery of the home to the buyer closing averages from two to six months 

 

customer service and quality control 

 

our operating divisions are responsible for preclosing quality control inspections and responding to customers’ postclosing needs we believe that a prompt and courteous response to homebuyers’ needs during and after construction reduces postclosing repair costs enhances our reputation for quality and service and ultimately leads to significant repeat and referral business from the real estate community and homebuyers we provide our homebuyers with a limited oneyear warranty on workmanship and building materials the subcontractors who perform the actual construction also provide us with warranties on workmanship and are generally prepared to respond to us and the homeowner promptly upon request in addition we typically provide a supplemental tenyear limited warranty that covers major construction defects and some of our suppliers provide manufacturer’s warranties on specified products installed in the home 

 

customer mortgage financing 

 

we provide mortgage financing services principally to purchasers of our homes in the majority of our homebuilding markets through our whollyowned subsidiary dhi mortgage dhi mortgage coordinates and expedites the sales transaction by ensuring that mortgage commitments are received and that closings take place in a timely and efficient manner dhi mortgage originates mortgage loans for a substantial portion of 

our homebuyers and when necessary to fulfill the needs of some homebuyers also brokers loans to thirdparty lenders who directly originate the mortgage loans during the year ended september 30 2008 approximately 92 of dhi mortgage’s loan volume related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations and dhi mortgage provided mortgage financing services for approximately 61 of our total homes closed 

 

to limit the risks associated with our mortgage operations dhi mortgage only originates loan products that it believes may be sold to thirdparty investors dhi mortgage generally packages and sells the loans and their servicing rights to thirdparty investors shortly after origination with limited recourse provisions in markets where we currently do not provide mortgage financing we work with a variety of mortgage lenders that make available to homebuyers a range of mortgage financing programs 

 

title services 

 

through our subsidiary title companies we serve as a title insurance agent in selected markets by providing title insurance policies examination and closing services to purchasers of homes we build and sell we currently assume little or no underwriting risk associated with these title policies 

 

employees 

 

at september 30 2008 we employed 3800 persons of whom 865 were sales and marketing personnel 1293 were executive administrative and clerical personnel 953 were involved in construction and 689 worked in mortgage and title operations we had fewer than 20 employees covered by collective bargaining agreements employees of some of the subcontractors which we use are represented by labor unions or are subject to collective bargaining agreements we believe that our relations with our employees and subcontractors are good 

 

competition 

 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive we compete in each of our markets with numerous other national regional and local homebuilders for homebuyers desirable properties raw materials skilled labor and financing we also compete with resales of existing homes and with the rental housing market our homes compete on the basis of quality price design mortgage financing terms and location in the current weak housing conditions competition among homebuilders has greatly intensified especially as to pricing and incentives as builders attempt to maximize sales volume despite the weakness in housing demand the current market conditions have also led to a large number of foreclosed homes being offered for sale which has increased competition for homebuyers and affected pricing our financial services business competes with other mortgage lenders including national regional and local mortgage bankers and other financial institutions some of which have greater access to capital different lending criteria and potentially broader product offerings 

 

governmental regulation and environmental matters 

 

the homebuilding industry is subject to extensive and complex regulations we and the subcontractors we use must comply with various federal state and local laws and regulations including zoning density and development requirements building environmental advertising and real estate sales rules and regulations these requirements affect the development process as well as building materials to be used building designs and minimum elevation of properties our homes are inspected by local authorities where required and homes eligible for insurance or guarantees provided by the fha and va are subject to inspection by them these regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities in addition our new housing developments may be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets and other public improvements 

 

our homebuilding operations are also subject to a variety of local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning protection of health safety and the environment the particular environmental laws for each site vary greatly according to location environmental condition and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties 

our mortgage company and title insurance agencies must also comply with various federal and state laws and regulations these include eligibility and other requirements for participation in the programs offered by the fha va gnma fannie mae and freddie mac these also include required compliance with consumer lending and other laws and regulations such as disclosure requirements prohibitions against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures all of these laws and regulations may subject our operations to examination by the applicable agencies 

 

seasonality 

 

we have typically experienced seasonal variations in our quarterly operating results and capital requirements prior to the current downturn in the homebuilding industry we generally had more homes under construction closed more homes and had greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year this seasonal activity increased our working capital requirements for our homebuilding operations during the third and fourth fiscal quarters and increased our funding requirements for the mortgages we originated in our financial services segment at the end of these quarters as a result of seasonal activity our results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year 

 

in contrast to our typical seasonal results due to further deterioration of homebuilding market conditions during the last two years we incurred consolidated operating losses in our third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2007 and in all quarters of fiscal 2008 these results were primarily due to recording significant inventory and goodwill impairment charges also the increasingly challenging market conditions caused declines in sales volume pricing and margins that mitigated our historical seasonal variations although we may experience our typical historical seasonal pattern in the future given the current market conditions we can make no assurances as to when or whether this pattern will recur

the homebuilding industry is undergoing a significant downturn and its duration and ultimate severity are uncertain a continuation or further deterioration in industry conditions or in the broader economic conditions could have additional adverse effects on our operations and financial results 

 

the downturn in the homebuilding industry is in its third year and it has become one of the most severe housing downturns in us history the significant declines in the demand for new homes the significant oversupply of homes on the market and the significant reductions in the availability of financing for homebuyers that have marked the downturn are continuing we have experienced material reductions in our home sales and homebuilding revenues and we have incurred material inventory and goodwill impairments and other writeoffs our gross margins have declined significantly and we incurred substantial losses for our 2007 and 2008 fiscal years it is not clear when these trends will reverse or when we will return to profitability 

 

our ability to respond to the downturn has been limited by adverse market and economic conditions recently the growing number of home mortgage foreclosures has increased supply and driven down prices making the purchase of a foreclosed home an attractive alternative to purchasing a new home homebuilders have responded to declining sales and increased cancellation rates with significant concessions further adding to the price declines with the decline in the values of homes and in the ability of homeowners to make their mortgage payments the credit markets have been significantly disrupted putting strains on many households and businesses in the face of these conditions fears of recession and the loss of jobs have increased and consumer confidence has reached its lowest level in decades as a result the decision to buy a new home has 

become more difficult and demand for new homes has declined significantly moreover the government’s legislative and administrative measures aimed at restoring liquidity to the credit markets and providing relief to homeowners facing foreclosure have only recently begun it is unclear whether these measures will effectively stabilize prices and home values or restore confidence and increase demand in the homebuilding industry 

 

these challenging conditions are complex and interrelated we cannot predict their duration or ultimate severity nor can we provide assurance that our responses to the downturn or the government’s attempts to address the troubles in the economy will be successful 

 

the downturn in homebuilding and the continuation of the disruptions in the credit markets could limit our ability to access capital and increase our costs of capital 

 

during this downturn in the homebuilding industry we have relied principally on the positive operating cash flow we have generated to meet our working capital needs and repay outstanding indebtedness we generated 188 billion and 136 billion in operating cash flow in fiscal years 2008 and 2007 respectively we anticipate significant positive operating cash flow for fiscal 2009 principally through the receipt of federal income tax refunds and from home and land sales though at a reduced level however the downturn and the disruption in the credit markets have reduced other sources of liquidity available to us 

 

in fiscal 2008 our senior debt ratings were lowered below investment grade by the three ratings agencies and the terms of our revolving credit facility now restrict our future borrowings to borrowing base limitations though we had no cash borrowings outstanding under the facility at september 30 2008 the borrowing base limitations currently have reduced availability under the facility to 528 million until we repay outstanding homebuilding debt at a faster pace than further inventory reductions or the limitations are amended we are currently exploring alternatives with regard to our revolving credit facility which could potentially include an amendment to the current agreement but consummating an amendment may be difficult in the current credit market we believe that any amendment will require an increase in the costs of borrowing a reduction in the overall credit commitment and possibly additional restrictions on us we do not currently anticipate a need to borrow from the facility and we plan to fund our shortterm working capital needs and our fiscal 2009 debt maturities through existing cash resources and cash flows generated from operations during fiscal 2009 

 

as of september 30 2008 we had 5497 million of senior notes that mature in january and february 2009 we have sufficient cash on hand to make these payments however current market conditions would significantly limit our ability to refinance this indebtedness if we chose to do so pricing in the public debt markets has increased substantially and the indenture terms available in these markets are generally more restrictive than those in our current indentures moreover our senior debt ratings the impact of our recent results on measures used by debt investors and the uncertainties facing the homebuilding industry could reduce our ability to access these markets even if acceptable pricing or terms are available to other issuers in addition the significant decline in our stock price the ongoing volatility in the stock markets and the reduction in our stockholders’ equity relative to our debt could also impede our access to the equity markets or increase the amount of dilution our stockholders would experience should we seek to raise capital through issuance of equity 

 

our financial services segment uses a 275 million mortgage repurchase facility to finance many of the loans it originates the facility must be renewed annually and the current facility expires in march 2009 a continuation of current market conditions could make the renewal more difficult or could result in an increase in the cost of the facility or a decrease in its committed availability such conditions may also make it more difficult or costly to sell the mortgages that we originate we have reduced our mortgage products to only those we expect to be able to sell 

 

while we believe we can meet our capital requirements from our cash resources future cash flow and the sources of financing that we anticipate will be available to us we can provide no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so particularly if current market or economic conditions continue or deteriorate further the future effects on our business liquidity and financial results of these conditions could be material and adverse to us both in ways described above and in other ways that we do not currently foresee 

the reduction in availability of mortgage financing and the increase in mortgage interest rates have adversely affected our business and the duration and ultimate severity of the effects are uncertain 

 

most of our customers finance their home purchases through lenders providing mortgage financing prior to the recent volatility in the financial markets mortgage interest rates were at historical lows and a variety of mortgage products were available as a result homeownership became more accessible the mortgage products available included features that allowed buyers to obtain financing for a significant portion up to all of the purchase price of the home had very limited underwriting requirements or provided for lower initial monthly payments as a result more people were able to qualify for mortgage financing mortgage interest rates have increased and the range of mortgage products to homebuyers has decreased from those previously available 

 

during fiscal 2007 and 2008 the mortgage lending industry experienced significant instability beginning with increased defaults on subprime loans and other nonconforming loans and compounded by expectations of increasing interest payment requirements and further defaults this in turn resulted in a decline in the market value of many mortgage loans and related securities lenders regulators and others questioned the adequacy of lending standards and other credit requirements for several loan products and programs offered in recent years credit requirements tightened and investor demand for mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities declined the deterioration in credit quality has caused almost all lenders to eliminate subprime mortgages and most other loan products that are not eligible for sale to fannie mae or freddie mac or loans that do not meet federal housing administration fha and veterans administration va requirements fewer loan products tighter loan qualifications and a reduced willingness of lenders to make loans in turn have made it more difficult for many buyers to finance the purchase of our homes these factors have served to reduce the pool of qualified homebuyers and made it more difficult to sell to first time and moveup buyers which have long made up a substantial part of our customers these reductions in demand have adversely affected our operations and financial results and the duration and severity of the effects are uncertain 

 

we believe that the liquidity provided by fannie mae and freddie mac to the mortgage industry has been very important to the housing market these entities have recently required substantial injections of capital from the federal government these injections have been accompanied by criticism that the pool of homebuyers these institutions seek to assist should be reduced any reduction in the availability of the financing provided by these institutions could adversely affect interest rates mortgage availability and our sales of new homes and mortgage loans 

 

in recent years a growing number of our homebuyers used down payment assistance programs which allowed them to receive gift funds from nonprofit corporations as a down payment homebuilders had been a source of funding for these programs however the american housing rescue and foreclosure prevention act of 2008 eliminated sellerfunded down payment assistance on fhainsured loans approved on or after october 1 2008 with the elimination of these gift fund programs we will seek other financing alternatives and seek down payment programs for those customers who meet applicable guidelines there can be no assurance however that any such alternative programs are available or as attractive to our customers as the programs previously offered and our sales could suffer 

 

because of the decline in the availability of other mortgage products fha and va mortgage financing support has become a more important factor in marketing our homes the american housing rescue and foreclosure prevention act of 2008 however includes a provision that increases a buyer’s down payment from at least 30 to at least 35 of the appraised value of the property on fha insured loans this down payment requirement may impact the ability of our customers that meet the fha guidelines to obtain financing additionally this limitation and other limitations or restrictions on the availability of fha and va financing could adversely affect interest rates mortgage availability and our sales of new homes and mortgage loans 

 

even if potential customers do not need financing changes in interest rates and the availability of mortgage products may make it harder for them to sell their current homes to potential buyers who need financing 

the decreases in mortgage availability have also been reflected in higher mortgage interest rates despite recent rate cuts by the federal reserve mortgage rates remain above their lows of the past few years and these interest rates may increase further if these rates remain high or increase the costs of owning a home will be affected and could result in further reductions in the demand for our homes 

 

our strategies in responding to the adverse conditions in the homebuilding industry have had limited success and the continued implementation of these and other strategies may not be successful 

 

while we have been successful in generating positive operating cash flow and reducing our inventories in fiscal 2007 and 2008 we have done so at significantly reduced gross profit levels and have incurred significant asset impairment charges these contributed to the net losses we recognized in fiscal 2007 and 2008 also in fiscal 2007 and 2008 notwithstanding our sales strategies we continued to experience an elevated rate of sales contract cancellations we believe that the increase in the cancellation rate is largely due to a decrease in homebuyer confidence due principally to continued price declines the growing number of foreclosures and reduced consumer confidence a more restrictive mortgage lending environment and the inability of some buyers to sell their existing homes have also impacted cancellations many of these factors which affect new sales and cancellation rates are beyond our control it is uncertain how long the reduction in sales and the increased level of cancellations will continue 

 

the homebuilding industry continues to be cyclical and affected by changes in general economic real estate or other business conditions that could adversely affect our business or financial results 

 

cyclical industry the homebuilding industry has been cyclical historically and continues to be significantly affected by changes in industry conditions as well as in general and local economic conditions such as 

 

  

these may occur on a national scale like the current downturn or may affect some of the regions or markets in which we operate more than others when adverse conditions affect any of our larger markets they could have a proportionately greater impact on us than on some other homebuilding companies our operations in previously strong markets particularly california florida nevada and arizona where we have significant inventory have more adversely affected our financial results than our other markets in the current downturn 

 

an oversupply of alternatives to new homes including foreclosed homes homes held for sale by investors and speculators other existing homes and rental properties can also reduce our ability to sell new homes and depress new home prices and reduce our margins on the sales of new homes 

 

inventory risks inventory risks are substantial for our homebuilding business the risks inherent in controlling or purchasing and developing land increase as consumer demand for housing decreases thus we may have acquired options on or bought and developed land at a cost we will not be able to recover fully or on which we cannot build and sell homes profitably our deposits for building lots controlled under option or similar contracts may be put at risk the value of undeveloped land building lots and housing inventories can also fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions in addition inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in reduced margins or losses in a poorly performing project or market in the 

present weak market conditions we have sold homes and land for lower margins or at a loss and we have recorded significant inventory impairment charges 

 

historically our goals for years of supply for ownership and control of land and building lots were based on management’s expectations for future volume growth in light of the much weaker market conditions encountered since fiscal 2006 we significantly slowed our purchases of land and lots and made substantial land and lot sales as part of our strategy to reduce our inventory to better match our reduced rate of production we also terminated numerous land option contracts and wrote off earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs related to these option contracts because future market conditions are uncertain we cannot provide assurance that these measures will be successful in managing our future inventory risks 

 

supply risks the homebuilding industry has from time to time experienced significant difficulties that can affect the cost or timing of construction including 

 

  

risks from nature weather conditions and natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes wildfires volcanic activity droughts and floods can harm our homebuilding business these can delay home closings adversely affect the cost or availability of materials or labor or damage homes under construction the climates and geology of many of the states in which we operate including california florida and texas where we have some of our larger operations present increased risks of adverse weather or natural disaster 

 

risks related to national security continued military deployments in the middle east and other overseas regions terrorist attacks other acts of violence or threats to national security and any corresponding response by the united states or others or related domestic or international instability may adversely affect general economic conditions or cause a slowdown of the economy 

 

consequences as a result of the foregoing matters potential customers may be less able or willing to buy our homes or we may take longer or incur more costs to build them because of current market conditions we have not been able to recapture any increased costs by raising prices in the future our ability to do so may also be limited by market conditions or because we fix our prices in advance of delivery by signing home sales contracts we may be unable to change the mix of our home offerings or the affordability of our homes to maintain our margins or satisfactorily address changing market conditions in other ways in addition cancellations of home sales contracts in backlog may increase as homebuyers cancel or do not honor their contracts 

 

our financial services business is closely related to our homebuilding business as it originates mortgage loans principally to purchasers of the homes we build a decrease in the demand for our homes because of the foregoing matters may also adversely affect the financial results of this segment of our business an increase in the default rate on the mortgages we originate may adversely affect our ability to sell the mortgages or the pricing we receive upon the sale of mortgages or may increase our repurchase obligations for previous originations 

 

increases in the costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business or our financial results 

 

significant expenses of owning a home including mortgage interest and real estate taxes generally are deductible expenses for an individual’s federal and in some cases state income taxes subject to various limitations under current tax law and policy if the federal government or a state government changes its income tax laws as has been discussed to eliminate or substantially modify these income tax deductions the 

aftertax cost of owning a new home could increase for many of our potential customers the resulting loss or reduction of homeowner tax deductions if such tax law changes were enacted without offsetting provisions could adversely impact demand for and sales prices of new homes 

 

in addition increases in property tax rates by local governmental authorities as experienced in response to reduced federal and state funding can adversely affect the ability of potential customers to obtain financing or their desire to purchase new homes 

 

governmental regulations could increase the cost and limit the availability of our development and homebuilding projects and adversely affect our business or financial results 

 

we are subject to extensive and complex regulations that affect land development and home construction including zoning density restrictions building design and building standards these regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities as to the conditions we must meet prior to being approved if approved at all we are subject to determinations by these authorities as to the adequacy of water or sewage facilities roads or other local services new housing developments may also be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets and other public improvements in addition in many markets government authorities have implemented no growth or growth control initiatives any of these can limit delay or increase the costs of development or home construction 

 

we are also subject to a variety of local state and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of health safety and the environment the impact of environmental laws varies depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available these matters may result in delays may cause us to incur substantial compliance remediation mitigation and other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas 

 

governmental regulation of our financial services operations could adversely affect our business or financial results 

 

our financial services operations are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations these include eligibility requirements for participation in federal loan programs compliance with consumer lending and similar requirements such as disclosure requirements prohibitions against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures they may also subject our operations to examination by the applicable agencies these factors may limit our ability to provide mortgage financing or title services to potential purchasers of our homes 

 

in november 2008 hud issued a final rule modifying certain aspects of the real estate settlement procedures act the rule is scheduled to become effective in january 2009 as part of the changes new limitations were placed on nonsettlement service providers such as homebuilders from providing incentives tied to the use of affiliated settlement service providers the new rule does not prevent settlement service providers from offering discounts or incentives however this change could negatively impact the number of loans closings and profitability of our financial services entities 

 

the turmoil caused by the increasing number of defaults in subprime and other loans has encouraged the investigation of financial services industry practices by governmental authorities these have only recently begun and they could include the examination of consumer lending practices sales of mortgages to financial institutions and other investors and the practices in the financial services segments of homebuilding companies we are unable to assess whether these governmental inquiries will result in changes in government regulation homebuilding industry practices or adversely affect the costs or potential profitability of homebuilding companies 

our substantial debt could adversely affect our financial condition 

 

we have a significant amount of debt as of september 30 2008 our consolidated debt was 37484 million as of september 30 2008 the scheduled maturities of principal on our outstanding debt for the subsequent 12 months totaled 7809 million 

 

possible consequences the amount and the maturities of our debt could have important consequences for example they could 

 

  

dependence on future performance our ability to meet our debt service and other obligations will depend in part upon our future financial performance our future results are subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report these have been compounded by the current industry and economic conditions our revenues and earnings vary with the level of general economic activity in the markets we serve our businesses are also affected by financial political business and other factors many of which are beyond our control the factors that affect our ability to generate cash can also affect our ability to raise additional funds for these purposes through the sale of debt or equity the refinancing of debt or the sale of assets changes in prevailing interest rates may affect our ability to meet our debt service obligations because borrowings under our credit facilities bear interest at floating rates 

 

credit facility and other restrictions our revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on our operations and activities by requiring us to maintain certain levels of leverage tangible net worth and components of inventory if we do not maintain the requisite levels we may not be able to pay dividends or available financing could be reduced or terminated also in the current conditions the margins by which we have met the financial covenants in our revolving credit facility have been reduced if they are further reduced significantly in the future we or our lenders may seek to negotiate revised terms for the facility that could increase the cost reduce the availability or change other conditions of the facility in addition the indentures governing our senior notes and senior subordinated notes impose restrictions on the creation of secured debt 

 

the mortgage repurchase facility for our financial services subsidiaries also requires the maintenance of minimum levels of tangible net worth ratio of debt to tangible net worth and net income by our financial services subsidiaries a failure to comply with these requirements could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds to the financial services subsidiaries or cause their debt to become due and payable prior to maturity 

 

changes in debt ratings in fiscal 2008 all three of the agencies that rate our senior unsecured debt lowered our ratings to a level below investment grade and two of the agencies lowered it even further during the year because we no longer maintain our investment grade credit ratings from at least two of these agencies credit under our revolving credit facility is currently limited to specified percentages of unencumbered inventory and the amount of other senior unsecured indebtedness additionally we are now subject to limitation on the number of unsold homes and the amount of developed lots and lots under development included in inventory the cost of such capital has increased and could increase more with further lowering of our debt ratings the further lowering of our debt ratings could also make accessing the public capital markets more difficult and expensive 

 

change of control purchase options if a change of control occurs as defined in the indentures governing many series of our senior and senior subordinated notes which constituted 16 billion principal amount in the aggregate as of september 30 2008 we would be required to offer to purchase such notes at 

101 of their principal amount together with all accrued and unpaid interest if any moreover a change of control as defined in our credit facilities may also result in the acceleration of our revolving credit facility or our financial services facility if purchase offers were required under the indentures for these notes or these facilities were accelerated we can give no assurance that we would have sufficient funds to pay the amounts that we would be required to purchase or repay at september 30 2008 we did not have sufficient funds available to purchase or pay all of such outstanding debt upon a change of control 

 

impact of financial services debt our financial services business is conducted through subsidiaries that are not restricted by our indentures or revolving credit facility the ability of our financial services subsidiaries to provide funds to our homebuilding operations however is subject to restrictions in their mortgage repurchase facility these funds would not be available to us upon the occurrence and during the continuance of defaults under this facility moreover our right to receive assets from these subsidiaries upon liquidation or recapitalization will be subject to the prior claims of the creditors of these subsidiaries any claims we may have to funds from this segment would be subordinate to subsidiary indebtedness to the extent of any security for such indebtedness and to any indebtedness otherwise recognized as senior to our claims 

 

failure to comply with certain financial tests or meet ratios contained in our credit facilities could preclude the payment of dividends impose restrictions on our business capital resources or other activities or otherwise adversely affect us 

 

our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial covenants based on leverage tangible net worth and components of inventory the facility also includes a borrowing base requirement that is currently in effect which limits availability based upon certain levels of inventory and the amount of other senior unsecured indebtedness if we do not maintain the requisite covenants we may not be able to pay dividends or available financing could be terminated the borrowing base limitation currently in effect limits availability under the facility to 528 million until we repay outstanding homebuilding debt at a faster pace than further inventory reductions or the limitations are amended in addition if noncompliance with these covenants were to result in an event of default the lenders could cease any further funding under the facility declare any outstanding amounts due and payable and require us to provide cash as collateral for any outstanding letters of credit not already collateralized the lenders could also seek to renegotiate the terms of the facility or impose further restrictions on our ability to pay dividends obtain other financing or engage in other activities 

 

in addition our mortgage subsidiary’s mortgage repurchase facility contains financial covenants applicable to that subsidiary if our mortgage subsidiary does not comply with those covenants and that results in an event of default the counterparties could cease further purchases under the facility and declare any outstanding amounts due and payable the counterparties could also seek to renegotiate the terms of the facility and the renewal of the facility could be more difficult 

 

homebuilding and financial services are very competitive and competitive conditions could adversely affect our business or our financial results 

 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive homebuilders compete not only for homebuyers but also for desirable properties financing raw materials and skilled labor we compete with other local regional and national homebuilders often within larger subdivisions designed planned and developed by such homebuilders we also compete with existing home sales foreclosures and rental properties the competitive conditions in the homebuilding industry can result in 

 

 17 

 

our financial services business competes with other mortgage lenders including national regional and local mortgage banks and other financial institutions mortgage lenders with greater access to capital or different lending criteria may be able to offer more attractive financing to potential customers 

 

when we are affected by these competitive conditions our business and financial results could be adversely affected in the current downturn in the homebuilding industry the reactions of our competitors may have reduced the effectiveness of our efforts to achieve pricing stability and reduce our inventory levels 

 

we cannot make any assurances that any future growth strategies will be successful 

 

although we focused on internal growth in recent years before the downturn in the homebuilding industry we may make strategic acquisitions of homebuilding companies or their assets in the future successful strategic acquisitions can require the integration of operations and management and other efforts to realize the benefits that may be available although we believe that we have been successful in doing so in the past we can give no assurance that we would be able to identify acquire and integrate successfully strategic acquisitions in the future acquisitions can result in the dilution of existing stockholders if we issue our common stock as consideration or reduce our liquidity or increase our debt if we fund them with cash in addition acquisitions can expose us to valuation risks including the risk of writing off goodwill related to such acquisitions based on the subsequent results of the operating segments to which the acquired businesses were assigned the risk of writeoffs related to goodwill impairment increases during a cyclical housing downturn when profitability of our operating segments may decline as evidenced by the goodwill impairment charges we recognized in fiscal 2007 and 2008 moreover we may not be able to implement successfully our operating and any future growth strategies within our existing markets 

 

we may not realize our deferred income tax asset 

 

as of september 30 2008 we have a deferred income tax asset of 2135 million which is net of a valuation allowance of 9613 million the ultimate realization of the deferred income tax asset is dependent upon the taxable income available in current statutory carryback periods reversals of existing taxable temporary differences tax planning strategies and our ability to generate taxable income within the statutory carryforward periods based on our assessment including the implementation of certain tax planning strategies the realization of approximately 9613 million of our deferred income tax asset is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the statutory carryforward periods in which the related temporary differences become deductible the use of net operating loss carryforwards is also subject to limitations should there be more than a 50 change in ownership of our common stock within a threeyear period as measured under the applicable tax regulations the remaining deferred income tax asset of 2135 million for which there are no valuation allowances relate to amounts that are expected to be primarily realized through net operating loss carrybacks to tax year 2007 

 

the accounting for deferred income taxes is based upon an estimate of future results and the valuation allowance may be increased or decreased as conditions change or if we are unable to implement certain tax planning strategies differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position changes in tax laws could also affect actual tax results and the valuation of deferred income tax assets over time 

 

homebuilding is subject to home warranty and construction defect claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant 

 

as a homebuilder we are subject to home warranty and construction defect claims arising in the ordinary course of business as a consequence we maintain product liability insurance obtain indemnities and certificates of insurance from subcontractors generally covering claims related to workmanship and materials and create warranty and other reserves for the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built because of the uncertainties inherent to these matters we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will be adequate to address all of our warranty and construction defect claims in the future contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce we may be responsible for applicable selfinsured retentions and some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable 

coverage limits additionally the coverage offered by and the availability of product liability insurance for construction defects is currently limited and costly we have responded to increases in insurance costs and coverage limitations in recent years by increasing our selfinsured retentions and claim reserves there can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted or become more costly

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

results of operations — fiscal year 2008 overview 

 

our fiscal 2008 results reflect the challenges that the homebuilding industry faced during the year during fiscal 2008 the factors hurting demand for new homes became more intense and pervasive across the united states as a result the already difficult conditions within the industry became progressively more challenging high inventory levels of both new and existing homes elevated cancellation rates low sales absorption rates and overall weak consumer confidence persisted throughout the year the effects of these factors were further magnified by credit tightening in the mortgage markets increasing home foreclosures and severe shortages of liquidity in the financial markets the liquidity shortage has caused concern about the viability of many financial institutions and has negatively impacted the already weakening economy which has created fears of a prolonged recession these factors combined with our continued elevated sales cancellation rate caused our sales volume to be significantly reduced also our gross profit from home sales revenues continued to decline as we offered higher levels of incentives and price concessions in attempts to stimulate demand in our communities 

 

as we progressed though fiscal 2008 our disappointing sales results further declines in our sales order prices continued declines in our gross profit from home sales revenues and the more challenging market conditions caused our outlook for the homebuilding industry to remain cautious we believe that housing market conditions may continue to deteriorate and that the timing of a recovery in the housing market remains unclear our outlook incorporates several factors including continued margin pressure from sales price reductions and incentives continued high levels of new and existing homes available for sale weak demand from new home consumers continued high sales cancellations significant restrictions on the availability of certain mortgage products and an overall increase in the underwriting requirements for home financing as a result of the recent credit tightening in the mortgage markets 

 

during fiscal 2008 particularly in the fourth quarter we sold a significant amount of land and lots through numerous transactions to generate cash flows reduce our future carrying costs and land development obligations and lower our inventory supply in certain markets to match our expectations of future demand consummating these transactions during the current fiscal year allowed us to monetize a larger portion of our deferred tax assets through a loss carryback to fiscal 2006 resulting in an increase in our expected tax refund 

 

due to the declining market conditions discussed above we evaluated a significant portion of our inventory in our quarterly impairment analyses during fiscal 2008 additionally we evaluated the recoverability of our goodwill our goodwill and inventory impairment evaluations reflected our expectation of continued and increasing challenges in the homebuilding industry and our belief that these challenging conditions will persist for some time based on our evaluations and as a result of our fourth quarter land and lot sales we recorded significant impairment charges to our inventory and goodwill balances during the year which materially affected our operating results during fiscal 2008 

 

strategy 

 

we believe the longterm fundamentals which support housing demand namely population growth and household formation remain solid we also believe the negative effects of the current market conditions although unyielding in the near term will moderate over the long term in the interim we remain committed to the following initiatives related to our operating strategy in the current homebuilding business environment 

 

  

 23 

 

  

  

these initiatives allowed us to generate significant cash flows from operations during fiscal 2007 and 2008 which we utilized to reduce our outstanding debt and increase our liquidity although we cannot provide any assurances that these initiatives will be successful we expect that our operating strategy will allow us to continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity position in fiscal 2009

results of operations — homebuilding 

 

our operating segments are our 34 homebuilding operating divisions which we aggregate into six reporting segments previously we presented seven homebuilding reporting segments based on our seven operating regions which had been determined to be our operating segments during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we reassessed the level at which the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 131 operating segment criteria is met and as a result changed our operating segments from the operating regions to the operating divisions as a result of this change the composition of our reporting segments was also revised the california markets which were previously presented as a separate reporting segment are now included in our west reporting segment additionally the salt lake city utah market which was previously included in our southwest reporting segment is now included in our west reporting segment furthermore the name of our northeast reporting segment has been changed to our east reporting segment although the markets comprising it remain the same all prior year segment information has been restated to conform to the fiscal 2008 presentation these reporting segments which we also refer to as reporting regions have homebuilding operations located in the following states

net sales orders and backlog 

 

net sales orders represent the number and dollar value of new sales contracts executed with customers net of sales contract cancellations the value of net sales orders decreased 43 to 46772 million 21251 homes in 2008 from 82306 million 33687 homes in 2007 the value of net sales orders decreased 35 to 8523 million 3977 homes in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 from 13095 million 6374 homes in the same period of fiscal 2007 the decreases in our net sales orders reflect the continued reduction of demand for new homes in most homebuilding markets we believe the most significant factors contributing to the slowing of demand for new homes in most of our markets include a continued high level of new and existing homes for sale which includes foreclosed homes for sale a decrease in the availability of mortgage financing for many potential homebuyers which has been further impacted by the recent uncertainty in the financial markets and a decline in homebuyer consumer confidence many prospective homebuyers continue to approach the purchase decision more tentatively due to continued increases in price concessions and sales incentives offered on both new and existing homes concern over their ability to sell an existing home or obtain mortgage financing and the general uncertainty surrounding the housing market and weakness in the overall economy we have attempted to increase sales by providing increased sales incentives and lowering prices but the factors above combined with the continued pricing responses of our competitors have limited the impact of our pricing efforts 

 

reflecting the recent significant erosion of consumer confidence our sales results during the fourth quarter worsened at the end of the quarter the elimination of sellerfunded down payment assistance on fha loans as of october 1 2008 will likely have a negative effect on future sales trends as further discussed below subsequent to fiscal year 2008 the volume of our net sales orders for the month ended october 31 2008 continued the weakness experienced at the end of the fourth quarter and decreased 23 compared to the month ended october 31 2007 

 

in comparing fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2007 the value of net sales orders decreased significantly in all six of our market regions these decreases were primarily due to substantially similar decreases in the number of homes sold in the respective region particularly in our west region the decline in average selling price also contributed to the decline in the value of net sales orders 

 

the average price of our net sales orders decreased 10 to 220100 in 2008 from 244300 in 2007 the average price of our net sales orders decreased significantly in our west region and to a lesser extent in our midwest and southeast regions due primarily to price reductions and increased incentives in our california las vegas denver and florida markets in general our pricing is dependent on the demand for our homes and declines in our average selling prices during fiscal 2008 were due in large part to increases in the use of price reductions and sales incentives in order to attempt to achieve an appropriate sales absorption pace further as the inventory of existing homes for sale which includes an increasing number of foreclosed homes has continued to be high it has led to the need to ensure our pricing is competitive with comparable existing home sales prices we monitor and may adjust our product mix geographic mix and pricing within our homebuilding markets in an effort to keep our core product offerings affordable for our target customer base typically firsttime and moveup homebuyers to a lesser extent than the competitive factors discussed above this has also contributed to decreases in the average selling price 

 

our annual cancellation rate cancelled sales orders divided by gross sales orders for the period was 40 in fiscal 2008 compared to 38 in fiscal 2007 our cancellation rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 was 47 and in the month ended october 31 2008 was 41 the higher cancellation rate during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 was primarily attributable to cancellations in our southwest region particularly in our arizona markets these elevated cancellation rates reflect the ongoing challenges in most of our homebuilding markets including the inability of many prospective homebuyers to sell their existing homes the continued erosion of buyer confidence and further credit tightening in the mortgage markets the impact of the credit tightening became apparent in our cancellation rates in late fiscal 2007 and into fiscal 2008 as the mortgage products many buyers had selected were no longer available or the buyers could no longer qualify due to stricter underwriting guidelines the shortage of liquidity in the financial markets during fiscal 2008 has 

further restricted the availability of credit we anticipate that cancellation rates will remain elevated and may continue to fluctuate substantially until market conditions improve 

 

in july 2008 congress passed and the president signed into law hr 3221 which includes the “american housing rescue and foreclosure prevention act of 2008” among other provisions this law eliminates sellerfunded down payment assistance on fha insured loans approved on or after october 1 2008 of our total home closings in fiscal 2008 approximately 25 were funded with mortgage loans whereby the homebuyer used a sellerfinanced down payment assistance program this is a significantly higher percentage of closings than experienced in prior years the use of such programs during fiscal 2008 was highest in our south central and southwest regions while we will seek other down payment assistance and mortgage financing alternatives for our buyers we expect the elimination of the sellerfinanced down payment assistance programs to have a negative impact on our future sales and revenues 

 

sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies including mortgage loan approval and buyers selling their existing homes which can result in cancellations before the current housing downturn our backlog had been an indicator of the level of home closings in our two subsequent fiscal quarters however due to our current elevated cancellation rates higher levels of unsold homes in inventory and difficult conditions in our markets this relationship between backlog and future home closings has changed 

 

at september 30 2008 the value of our backlog of sales orders was 12074 million 5297 homes a decrease of 55 from 26944 million 10442 homes at september 30 2007 the average sales price of homes in backlog was 227900 at september 30 2008 down 12 from the 258000 average at september 30 2007 the value of our sales order backlog decreased significantly across all of our market regions reflecting the severity and geographic reach of the national housing downturn 

 

home sales revenue and gross profit 

 

revenues from home sales decreased 43 to 61643 million 26396 homes closed in 2008 from 107212 million 41370 homes closed in 2007 the average selling price of homes closed during 2008 was 233500 down 10 from 259200 in 2007 during fiscal 2008 home sales revenues decreased significantly in all of our market regions reflecting continued weak demand and the resulting decline in net sales order volume and pricing during the year 

 

the number of homes closed in 2008 decreased 36 due to decreases in all of our market regions as a result of the decline in net sales orders during the year and the decline in our sales order backlog we expect to close fewer homes in fiscal 2009 than we did in fiscal 2008 as conditions change in the housing markets in which we operate our ongoing level of net sales orders will determine the number of home closings and amount of revenue we will generate 

 

revenues from home sales in fiscal 2008 and 2007 were increased by 268 million and 580 million respectively from changes in profit deferred pursuant to sfas no 66 “accounting for sales of real estate” the home sales profit related to our mortgage loans held for sale is deferred in instances where a buyer finances a home through our whollyowned mortgage company and has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment as prescribed by sfas no 66 as of september 30 2008 the balance of deferred profit related to these mortgage loans held for sale was 58 million compared to 326 million at september 30 2007 the decline is mainly due to the reduced availability of the mortgage types whose use generally resulted in the sfas no 66 profit deferral 

 

gross profit from home sales decreased by 63 to 6912 million in 2008 from 18489 million in 2007 and as a percentage of home sales revenues decreased 600 basis points to 112 the primary factor reducing our home sales gross profit margin was the difficult market conditions discussed above which narrowed the range between our selling prices and costs of our homes in most of our markets causing a decline of approximately 430 basis points in home sales gross profit as a percentage of home sales revenues due to the current sales environment in many of our markets we have offered a variety of incentives and price concessions which affect our gross profit margin by reducing the selling price of the home or increasing 

the cost of the home without a proportional increase in the selling price we are also offering greater discounts and incentives to sell our inventory of completed homes which is at a higher than desired level this strategy helped reduce our completed homes in inventory but also contributed to a decline in our home sales gross profit additionally our home sales gross margin decreased approximately 210 basis points due to an increase in the amortization of capitalized interest and property taxes as a percentage of home sales revenues and 10 basis points due to the recognition of a lesser amount of previously deferred gross profit during 2008 compared to 2007 these decreases were partially offset by an improvement of 50 basis points due to a decrease in warranty and construction defect expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues 

 

during fiscal 2008 when we performed our quarterly inventory impairment analyses the assumptions utilized reflected our outlook for the homebuilding industry and its impact on our business this outlook incorporates our belief that housing market conditions may continue to deteriorate and that these challenging conditions will persist for some time accordingly our impairment evaluation as of september 30 2008 again indicated a significant number of communities with impairment indicators communities with a combined carrying value of 21862 million as of september 30 2008 had indicators of potential impairment and were evaluated for impairment the analysis of each of these communities generally assumed that sales prices in future periods will be equal to or lower than current sales order prices in each community or for comparable communities in order to generate an acceptable absorption rate while it is difficult to determine a timeframe for a given community in the current market conditions we estimated the remaining lives of these communities to range from six months to in excess of ten years through this evaluation process we determined that communities with a carrying value of 9678 million as of september 30 2008 the largest portions of which were in the west and southeast regions were impaired as a result during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we recorded impairment charges of 3647 million to reduce the carrying value of the impaired communities to their estimated fair value 

 

due to the significant decline in demand for new homes we have reduced our expectations of future home closing volumes as well as our expected need for land and lots in the future consequently during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we sold a significant amount of land and lots in connection with these land and lot sales we recorded impairment charges of 6242 million to reduce the 8144 million carrying value of this inventory to its net realizable value including impairments related to land sales impairment charges during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 totaled 9889 million as compared to 2783 million in the prior year period the fourth quarter charges combined with impairment charges recorded earlier in the year resulted in total inventory impairment charges of 23726 million and 12222 million during fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively we perform our impairment analysis based on total inventory at the community level when an impairment charge for a community is determined the charge is then allocated to each lot in the community in the same manner as land and development costs are allocated to each lot the inventory within each community is categorized as construction in progress and finished homes residential land and lots — developed and under development and land held for development based on the stage of production or plans for future development during fiscal 2008 excluding impairments related to land sales approximately 79 of the impairment charges were recorded to residential land and lots and land held for development and approximately 21 of the charges were recorded to residential construction in progress and finished homes inventory compared to 74 and 26 respectively in fiscal 2007 

 

of the remaining 12184 million of projects with impairment indicators which were determined not to be impaired at september 30 2008 the largest concentrations were in florida 18 texas 13 and california 12 it is possible that our estimate of undiscounted cash flows from these communities may change and could result in a future need to record impairment charges to write these assets down to fair value additionally if conditions in the broader economy homebuilding industry or specific markets in which we operate worsen beyond current expectations and as we reevaluate specific community pricing and incentives and our land sale strategies we may be required to evaluate additional communities or reevaluate previously impaired communities for potential impairment these evaluations may result in additional impairment charges which could be material 

 

based on a quarterly review of land and lot option contracts we have written off earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs related to land and lot option contracts which we no longer plan to pursue during 

fiscal 2008 and 2007 we wrote off 1119 million and 1073 million respectively of earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs related to land option purchase contracts should the current weak homebuilding market conditions persist and we are unable to successfully renegotiate certain land purchase contracts we may write off additional earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs 

 

the inventory impairment charges and writeoffs of earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs reduced total homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding revenues by approximately 3810 basis points in fiscal 2008 compared to 1200 basis points in fiscal 2007 

 

land sales revenue and gross profit 

 

land sales revenues decreased 4 to 3543 million in 2008 from 3676 million in 2007 the gross profit percentage from land sales decreased to 85 in 2008 from 229 in 2007 due to the significant decline in demand for new homes we have reduced our expectations of future home closing volumes as well as our expected need for land and lots in the future consequently during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we sold a significant amount of land and lots through numerous transactions to generate cash flows reduce our future carrying costs and land development obligations and lower our inventory supply in certain markets consummating these transactions during the current fiscal year allowed us to monetize a larger portion of our deferred tax assets through a loss carryback to fiscal 2006 resulting in an increase in our expected tax refund the terms of certain of these land and lot sales primarily related to our continuing involvement with the properties resulted in the deferral of the recognition of the sale transaction in some cases consequently 217 million of inventory reflecting its current fair value is recorded as a component of inventory not owned in markets where we own more land and lots than our expected needs in the next few years we plan to attempt to sell these excess lots and land parcels as of september 30 2008 we had 394 million of land held for sale which we expect to sell in the next 12 months 

 

selling general and administrative sga expense 

 

sga expense from homebuilding activities decreased by 3497 million or 31 to 7918 million in 2008 from 11415 million in 2007 as a percentage of homebuilding revenues sga expense increased 180 basis points to 121 in 2008 from 103 in 2007 due to a decrease in revenues the largest component of our homebuilding sga expense is employee compensation and related costs which represented 53 and 59 of sga costs in 2008 and 2007 respectively those costs decreased 2542 million or 38 to 4179 million in 2008 from 6722 million in 2007 largely due to our continued efforts to align the number of employees to match our current and anticipated home closing levels as well as a decrease in incentive compensation which is primarily based on profitability our homebuilding operations employed approximately 3100 and 5100 employees at september 30 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

we continue to adjust our sga infrastructure to support our expected closings volume however we cannot make assurances that our actions will permit us to maintain or improve upon the current sga expense as a percentage of revenues it may become more difficult to reduce sga expense as the size of our operations decreases if revenues continue to decrease and we are unable to sufficiently adjust our sga future sga expense as a percentage of revenues may increase further 

 

interest incurred 

 

we capitalize homebuilding interest costs to inventory during development and construction during fiscal 2007 our inventory eligible for interest capitalization “active inventory” exceeded our debt levels therefore we capitalized all interest from homebuilding debt however due to our inventory reduction strategies slowing or suspending land development in certain communities and limiting the construction of unsold homes our active inventory has been lower than our debt level in recent quarters as a result we expensed 390 million of interest incurred during fiscal 2008 

 

interest amortized to cost of sales excluding interest written off with inventory impairment charges was 39 of total home and landlot cost of sales in 2008 compared to 24 in 2007 the increase in the rate of interest amortized to cost of sales was primarily due to a greater decline in our home closings volume as 

compared to the decline in our interest incurred during the year and a more rapid reduction in our active inventory levels than our interest incurred over the time period in which fiscal 2008 closings were active versus the prior year closings 

 

interest incurred is directly related to the average level of our homebuilding debt outstanding during the period comparing fiscal 2008 with fiscal 2007 interest incurred related to homebuilding debt decreased by 22 to 2367 million primarily due to a 23 decrease in our average homebuilding debt 

 

loss on early retirement of debt 

 

in fiscal 2008 we recorded a loss on early retirement of debt of 26 million which was primarily due to the writeoff of unamortized fees associated with reducing the size of our revolving credit facility in june 2008 in fiscal 2007 in connection with the early retirement of our 85 senior notes due 2012 we recorded a loss of 121 million for the call premium and the unamortized discount and fees related to the redeemed notes 

 

other income 

 

other income net of other expenses associated with homebuilding activities was 91 million in 2008 compared to 40 million in 2007 the increase in other income in fiscal 2008 was primarily due to an increase in interest income 

 

goodwill 

 

in performing our annual impairment analysis as of september 30 2008 we estimated the fair value of our operating segments utilizing the expected present values of future cash flows as a result of this analysis we determined that the goodwill balance related to each operating segment in our southwest reporting region was impaired consequently during the fourth quarter we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 794 million 

 

as of september 30 2008 our remaining goodwill balance was 159 million all of which related to our south central reporting segment as of september 30 2007 allocation of our remaining goodwill balance of 953 million was as follows south central 159 million and southwest 794 million 

 

the goodwill assessment procedures of sfas no 142 require us to make comprehensive estimates of future revenues and costs due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates actual results could differ from such estimates 

 

income taxes 

 

sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if based on the available evidence it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized accordingly we periodically assess the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets based on the sfas no 109 morelikelythannot realization threshold criterion in the assessment for a valuation allowance appropriate consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets this assessment considers among other matters the taxable income available in current statutory carryback periods reversals of existing taxable temporary differences tax planning strategies the nature frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses the duration of statutory carryforward periods our historical experience in generating operating profits and expectations for future profitability in making such judgments significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified sfas no 109 provides that a cumulative loss in recent years is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable and also restricts the amount of reliance on projections of future taxable income to support the recovery of deferred tax assets 

 

due to the challenging market conditions in the homebuilding industry during the past two years we have recorded significant impairment charges for both inventory and goodwill and are in a threeyear cumulative pretax loss position for fiscal years 2006 through 2008 while we have a long history of profitable 

operations prior to the current downturn in the homebuilding industry the expected cumulative loss position is significant negative evidence in assessing the recoverability of our deferred tax assets therefore we recorded a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets representing those deferred tax asset amounts for which ultimate realization is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the related temporary differences become deductible the remaining deferred tax assets of 2135 million for which there are no valuation allowances relate to amounts that are expected to be primarily realized through net operating loss carrybacks to tax year 2007 

 

the accounting for deferred taxes is based upon an estimate of future results differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position changes in existing tax laws could also affect actual tax results and the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 

 

during fiscal 2008 particularly in the fourth quarter we sold a significant amount of land and lots through numerous transactions to generate cash flows reduce our future carrying costs and land development obligations and lower our inventory supply in certain markets to match our expectations of future demand these transactions combined with the results of all of our operations in this difficult housing environment generated a net operating tax loss that can be carried back to fiscal 2006 and will result in a federal income tax refund consequently we recorded a 6762 million federal income tax receivable relating to the net operating loss carryback refund claim at september 30 2008 

 

on october 1 2007 we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 48 fin 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” fin 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for recognizing measuring presenting and disclosing in the financial statements tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return including the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements the cumulative effect of adopting fin 48 had no impact on our beginning retained earnings effective with our adoption of fin 48 interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in the financial statements as a component of the income tax provision interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits were previously included in interest expense and in selling general and administrative expense respectively during fiscal 2008 we recognized interest and penalties of 40 million in our consolidated statement of operations and at september 30 2008 our total accrued interest and penalties relating to unrecognized income tax benefits was 49 million as of september 30 our total unrecognized income tax benefits were 187 million all tax positions if recognized would affect our effective income tax rate we do not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly decrease or increase within twelve months of the current reporting date 

 

we are subject to federal income tax and to income tax in multiple states the internal revenue service is currently examining our fiscal years 2004 and 2005 and we are being audited by various states the statute of limitations for our major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for fiscal years 2004 through 2008 

 

in fiscal 2008 the provision for income taxes was 18 million which reflects the effect of the establishment of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in fiscal 2007 the benefit from income taxes was 2387 million corresponding to the loss before income taxes for the year our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 differs from the statutory rate primarily because of the establishment of the valuation allowance as discussed above 

 

homebuilding results by reporting region 

 

east region  — homebuilding revenues decreased 46 in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to a 44 decrease in the number of homes closed as well as a slight decrease in the average selling price of those homes the region reported a loss before income taxes of 3325 million in 2008 compared to a loss of 661 million in 2007 the losses were primarily due to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs totaling 2884 million and 815 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively in fiscal 2008 inventory impairment charges included 427 million of impairments related to fourth quarter land sales in fiscal 2007 goodwill impairment charges of 394 million also contributed to the loss a 

decrease in the region’s gross profit from home sales as a percentage of home sales revenue home sales gross profit percentage of 930 basis points in 2008 compared to 2007 also contributed to the increase in loss before income taxes the home sales gross profit percentage declined in most of the region’s markets many of which have had very high sales cancellations resulting in unsold homes we aggressively priced to sell despite implementing significant cost control measures our revenues declined at a greater rate 46 than our sga expense 29 which also contributed to the loss before income taxes in this region 

 

midwest region  — homebuilding revenues decreased 51 in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to a 46 decrease in the number of homes closed as well as a 7 decrease in the average selling price of those homes the region reported a loss before income taxes of 1843 million in 2008 compared to a loss of 2053 million in 2007 the losses were primarily due to a decline in revenues and inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs totaling 1633 million and 1673 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively while the region’s home sales gross profit percentage remained relatively flat in fiscal 2008 inventory impairment charges included 336 million of impairments related to fourth quarter land sales in fiscal 2007 goodwill impairment charges of 485 million also contributed to the loss despite implementing significant cost control measures our revenues declined at a greater rate 51 than our sga expense 31 which also contributed to the loss before income taxes in this region 

 

southeast region  — homebuilding revenues decreased 44 in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to a 41 decrease in the number of homes closed as well as a 9 decrease in the average selling price of those homes the region reported a loss before income taxes of 5077 million in 2008 compared to a loss of 1316 million in 2007 the losses were primarily due to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs totaling 4575 million and 2102 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively in fiscal 2008 inventory impairment charges included 1167 million of impairments related to fourth quarter land sales in fiscal 2007 goodwill impairment charges of 115 million also contributed to the loss a decrease in the region’s home sales gross profit percentage of 990 basis points in 2008 compared to 2007 also contributed to the increase in loss before income taxes the home sales gross profit percentage declines in our florida markets had the greatest impact on the overall decreases the florida markets experienced rapid price increases in previous years which encouraged speculation in residential real estate creating an environment that has shown not to be sustainable the tightening in the mortgage environment high cancellation rates and existing homes for sale by investors have led to increased inventory levels requiring price reductions and increased levels of sales incentives to compete for the reduced pool of qualified buyers resulting in substantial gross profit declines 

 

south central region  — homebuilding revenues decreased 28 in 2008 compared to 2007 due to a 29 decrease in the number of homes closed the region reported a loss before income taxes of 90 million in 2008 compared to income before income taxes of 1222 million in 2007 the loss in fiscal 2008 was primarily due to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs totaling 724 million in fiscal 2008 compared to 246 million in 2007 in fiscal 2008 inventory impairment charges included 291 million of impairments related to fourth quarter land sales in addition the region’s home sales gross profit percentage decreased 130 basis points in 2008 compared to 2007 the decline in home sales gross profit was largely due to softening in the san antonio market where inventories of new and existing homes have increased resulting in increased levels of sales incentives being offered by builders the majority of the region’s inventory impairment charges were also in the san antonio market 

 

southwest region  — homebuilding revenues decreased 38 in 2008 compared to 2007 due to a 35 decrease in the number of homes closed as well as an 11 decrease in the average selling price of those homes the region reported a loss before income taxes of 3667 million in 2008 compared to income before income taxes of 1929 million in 2007 the loss in fiscal 2008 was primarily due to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs totaling 3307 million compared to 268 million in 2007 in fiscal 2008 inventory impairment charges included 1554 million of impairments related to fourth quarter land sales a decrease in the region’s home sales gross profit percentage of 720 basis points in 2008 compared to 2007 which was largely due to declines in our phoenix market also contributed to the reduction in income before income taxes the phoenix market experienced rapid price increases in previous years which encouraged speculation in residential real estate creating an environment that has shown 

not to be sustainable the tightening in the mortgage environment high cancellation rates and existing homes for sale by investors have led to increased inventory levels requiring price reductions and increased levels of sales incentives to compete for the reduced pool of qualified buyers resulting in substantial gross profit declines the increased number of foreclosed homes being offered for sale in phoenix has added further pressure to sales prices in fiscal 2008 goodwill impairment charges of 794 million also contributed to the loss 

 

west region  — homebuilding revenues decreased 45 in 2008 compared to 2007 due to a 36 decrease in the number of homes closed as well as a 17 decrease in the average selling price of those homes the region reported a loss before income taxes of 13 billion in 2008 compared to a loss of 9321 million in 2007 the losses were primarily due to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs totaling 12 billion and 8191 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively the majority of the inventory impairments relate to projects in our california and las vegas markets in fiscal 2008 inventory impairment charges included 2467 million of impairments related to fourth quarter land sales in fiscal 2007 goodwill impairment charges of 3747 million also contributed to the loss a decrease in the region’s home sales gross profit percentage of 920 basis points in 2008 compared to 2007 also contributed to the increase in loss before income taxes although all of the region’s markets have experienced weak market conditions the home sales gross profit percentage decline in our california and las vegas markets had the greatest impact on the overall decreases for the region the california and las vegas markets experienced rapid significant home price increases in previous years which contributed to gross profit increases in 2005 and continued elevated gross profits in 2006 but these price increases also strained housing affordability for many potential homebuyers there credit tightening in the mortgage markets has also significantly limited the availability of many mortgage products used extensively by california and las vegas homebuyers in previous years increased levels of sales incentives and home price reductions have been typical in these markets as builders have attempted to increase demand for homes to reduce high inventory levels and to address affordability concerns resulting in substantial gross profit declines the increased number of foreclosed homes being offered for sale in california and las vegas has added further pressure to sales prices

homebuilding operating margin analysis 

 

 

 

net sales orders and backlog 

 

the value of net sales orders decreased 41 to 82306 million 33687 homes in 2007 from 138952 million 51980 homes in 2006 reflecting the continued softening of demand for new homes in most homebuilding markets factors that contributed to the slowing of demand included an increase in the supply of existing homes for sale a reduction in investor purchases an increase in incentives offered by homebuilders and sellers of existing homes a decrease in the availability of mortgage financing for many potential homebuyers and a decline in homebuyer consumer confidence 

 

in comparing fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2006 the value of net sales orders decreased significantly in all six of our market regions these decreases were primarily due to substantially similar decreases in the number of homes sold in each region although in our southeast southwest and west regions a decline in average selling prices was also a significant factor the most significant decline in net sales orders occurred in our west region with 43 fewer homes sold in fiscal 2007 than in fiscal 2006 we believe that home sales in our california markets were negatively impacted to a greater extent than our other markets by a reduction in the pool of qualified buyers due to a lack of housing affordability and the decline of mortgage availability 

 

the average price of our net sales orders in fiscal 2007 was 244300 a decrease of 9 from the 267300 average in fiscal 2006 the average price of our net sales orders decreased significantly in our southeast southwest and west regions due primarily to price reductions and increased incentives in our florida arizona and california markets in general our pricing is dependent on the demand for our homes and declines in our average selling prices during the year were due in large part to increases in the use of price reductions and sales incentives further as the inventory of existing homes for sale continued to rise it led to the need to ensure that our pricing was competitive with comparable existing home sales prices as part of our efforts to keep our core product offerings affordable for our target customer base adjustments to our product and geographic mix and pricing within our homebuilding markets also contributed to decreases in the average selling price 

 

our annual cancellation rate was 38 in fiscal 2007 compared to 28 in fiscal 2006 the higher overall cancellation rate for fiscal 2007 was primarily attributable to cancellations in many of our arizona california and florida markets these elevated cancellation rates reflect the ongoing challenges in most homebuilding markets including the inability of many prospective homebuyers to sell their existing homes the increasing level of sales incentives and home price reductions in our markets continuing to erode buyer confidence and further credit tightening in the mortgage markets the impact of the credit tightening became apparent in our cancellation rates in late fiscal 2007 as the mortgage products many buyers had selected were no longer available or they could not qualify due to stricter underwriting guidelines 

at september 30 2007 the value of our backlog of sales orders was 26944 million 10442 homes a decrease of 48 from 51851 million 18125 homes at september 30 2006 the average sales price of homes in backlog was 258000 at september 30 2007 down 10 from the 286100 average at september 30 2006 the value of our sales order backlog decreased significantly in all of our market regions 

 

home sales revenue and gross profit 

 

revenues from home sales decreased 26 to 107212 million 41370 homes closed in 2007 from 145454 million 53099 homes closed in 2006 revenues from home sales decreased in all six of our market regions led by the midwest and west regions with decreases of 41 and 36 respectively the number of homes closed in 2007 decreased 22 and the average selling price of those homes decreased 5 these decreases were the result of slowing demand and the resulting decline in net sales order volume and pricing during fiscal 2007 

 

revenues from home sales in fiscal 2007 and 2006 were increased by 580 million and 16 million respectively from changes in profit deferred pursuant to sfas no 66 as of september 30 2007 the balance of deferred profit was 326 million compared to 906 million at september 30 2006 the decline was attributable to both the drop in the number of homes closed and a decline in the availability of the mortgage types whose use generally resulted in the sfas no 66 profit deferral 

 

total homebuilding gross profit decreased by 82 to 6037 million in 2007 from 33422 million in 2006 including sales of both homes and landlots as well as impairment charges and land option cost writeoffs total homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding revenues decreased 1720 basis points to 54 in 2007 from 226 in 2006 approximately 1020 basis points of the decrease was due to the effect of inventory impairment charges and land option cost writeoffs as a percentage of homebuilding revenues these were 120 in fiscal 2007 versus 18 in fiscal 2006 

 

gross profit from home sales decreased by 47 to 18489 million in 2007 from 34976 million in 2006 and as a percentage of home sales revenues decreased 680 basis points to 172 the primary factor reducing our home sales gross profit margin was the difficult market conditions discussed above which narrowed the range between our selling prices and costs of our homes in most of our markets causing a decline of approximately 650 basis points in home sales gross profit as a percentage of home sales revenues due to declining sales in many of our markets we offered a variety of incentives and price concessions which affected our gross profit margin by reducing the selling price of the home or increasing the cost of the home without a proportional increase in the selling price we also offered greater discounts and incentives to sell our inventory of homes which was at a higher than desired level this strategy helped reduce our total homes in inventory by approximately 8600 units during fiscal 2007 but also contributed to a decline in our home sales gross profit additionally our home sales gross margin decreased approximately 60 basis points due to an increase in the amortization of capitalized interest and 30 basis points due to an increase in warranty and construction defect expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues these decreases were partially offset by improvements in home sales gross margin of 20 basis points due primarily to an increase in the relative number of home closings in our more profitable markets and 40 basis points resulting from the recognition of 580 million of previously deferred gross profit during 2007 compared to 16 million in 2006 

 

during fiscal 2007 the difficult conditions within the homebuilding industry became more challenging high inventory levels of both new and existing homes elevated cancellation rates low sales absorption rates affordability issues and overall weak consumer confidence persisted throughout the year the effects of these factors were further magnified by a decline in availability of mortgage products and higher mortgage interest rates on certain loan products due to credit tightening in the mortgage markets these factors combined with our disappointing sales results further declines in sales order prices and continued declines in gross profit from home sales revenues throughout the year caused our outlook for the homebuilding industry and its impact on our business to become more cautious as the year progressed 

 

during fiscal 2007 when we performed our quarterly inventory impairment analyses the assumptions utilized incorporated our outlook which reflected the expectation that the challenging conditions in the homebuilding industry would persist and have a greater impact than we believed when the year began 

consequently our strategy to reduce our inventory and lot position in a number of markets would likely take longer and require additional price concessions and incentives than previously anticipated therefore our impairment evaluations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 indicated a significant number of projects with impairment indicators communities with a combined carrying value of 26224 million as of september 30 2007 had indicators of potential impairment and were evaluated for impairment the analysis of each of these projects generally assumed that sales prices in future periods will be equal to or lower than current sales order prices in each project or for comparable projects in order to generate an acceptable absorption rate while it is difficult to determine a timeframe for a given project in the current market conditions we estimated the remaining lives of these projects to range from six months to in excess of ten years through these evaluations we determined that projects with a carrying value of 9405 million as of september 30 2007 the largest portions of which were in the west and southeast regions were impaired as a result during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 we recorded impairment charges totaling 2783 million to reduce the carrying value of the impaired projects to their estimated fair value these fourth quarter charges combined with impairment charges recorded earlier in the year resulted in total inventory impairment charges of 12222 million during fiscal 2007 approximately 74 of these impairment charges were recorded to residential land and lots and land held for development and approximately 26 of these charges were recorded to residential construction in progress and finished homes in inventory during fiscal 2006 we recorded impairment charges totaling 1462 million related to projects with a carrying value of 4593 million the majority of which were in california of the remaining 16819 million of projects with impairment indicators which were determined not to be impaired at september 30 2007 the largest concentrations were in california 28 florida 20 and arizona 16 

 

during fiscal 2007 and 2006 we wrote off 1073 million and 1247 million respectively of earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs related to land option purchase contracts which we determined we would not pursue the inventory impairment charges and writeoffs of earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs reduced total homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding revenues by approximately 1200 basis points in fiscal 2007 compared to 180 basis points in fiscal 2006 

 

selling general and administrative sga expense 

 

sga expense from homebuilding activities decreased by 3151 million or 22 to 11415 million in 2007 from 14566 million in 2006 as a percentage of homebuilding revenues sga expense increased 40 basis points to 103 in 2007 from 99 in 2006 due to a decrease in revenues the largest component of our homebuilding sga expense is employee compensation and related costs which represented 59 and 64 of sga costs in 2007 and 2006 respectively those costs decreased 2602 million or 28 to 6722 million in 2007 from 9324 million in 2006 largely due to our efforts to align the number of employees to match our home closing levels as well as a decrease in incentive compensation which is primarily based on profitability our homebuilding operations employed approximately 5100 and 7100 employees at september 30 2007 and 2006 respectively the remaining decrease in sga expense of 549 million was primarily attributable to decreases in subdivision maintenance advertising costs and professional consulting fees 

 

interest incurred 

 

we capitalize homebuilding interest costs to inventory during development and construction during both fiscal years our active inventory exceeded our debt levels therefore we capitalized all interest from homebuilding debt interest amortized to cost of sales excluding interest written off with inventory impairment charges was 24 of total home and landlot cost of sales in 2007 compared to 21 in 2006 

 

interest incurred is directly related to the average level of our homebuilding debt outstanding during the period comparing fiscal 2007 with fiscal 2006 interest incurred related to homebuilding debt decreased by 6 to 3043 million primarily due to a 5 decrease in our average homebuilding debt 

 

loss on early retirement of debt 

 

in fiscal 2007 in connection with the early retirement of our 85 senior notes due 2012 we recorded a loss of approximately 121 million for the call premium and the unamortized discount and fees related to the redeemed notes in fiscal 2006 in connection with the early retirement of our 9375 senior subordinated notes due 2011 and our 105 senior subordinated notes due 2011 we recorded a loss of approximately 134 million for the call premium and the unamortized discount and fees net of any unamortized premium related to these redeemed notes similarly we recorded a loss of approximately 44 million related to the unamortized fees associated with the redemption and replacement of our revolving credit facility in fiscal 2006 

 

other income 

 

other income net of other expenses associated with homebuilding activities was 40 million in 2007 compared to 110 million in 2006 major components of other income in both years were interest income and gain on the sale of assets while in fiscal 2006 the increase in the fair value of our interest rate swaps was also a major component 

 

goodwill 

 

at june 30 2007 we determined that an interim test to assess the recoverability of goodwill was necessary because of the significant amount of inventory tested for impairment under sfas no 144 the market conditions in the homebuilding industry and the decline in our stock price we completed the first step of our goodwill impairment analysis as of june 30 2007 and concluded an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated for our east southeast and west reporting segments as a result during the quarter ended june 30 2007 we recorded goodwill impairment charges totaling 4256 million 

 

during the quarter ended september 30 2007 we completed the second step of our goodwill impairment analysis through which we confirmed the appropriateness of our prior quarter writeoffs and determined that the goodwill balance related to our midwest reporting segment was completely impaired consequently the goodwill balance in our midwest reporting segment of 485 million which included 135 million transferred from the southwest reporting segment due to changing our management structure was written off in the fourth quarter total goodwill impairment charges for fiscal 2007 were 4741 million 

 

in addition at september 30 2007 we completed our annual impairment test and determined that the fair values of our south central and southwest reporting segments were greater than their carrying values and no impairment of goodwill existed in those segments 

 

our goodwill balances by reporting segment as of september 30 2007 and 2006 were as follows prior year amounts have been restated between reporting segments as appropriate to conform to the 2008 presentation 

 

 

income taxes 

 

in fiscal 2007 the benefit from income taxes was 2387 million corresponding to the loss before income taxes for the year in fiscal 2006 the provision for income taxes was 7538 million corresponding to the income before income taxes for the year 

 

our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2007 was 251 compared to an effective tax rate of 379 in fiscal 2006 the effective tax rate during 2007 was lower than the effective tax rate in 2006 resulting in a reduced benefit from income taxes related to the loss in the year because only approximately 23 of the 4741 million goodwill impairment charge recorded in fiscal 2007 was deductible for tax purposes excluding the goodwill impairment charge the effective tax rate was 409 for fiscal 2007 

 

primarily as a result of recording significant inventory impairment charges during fiscal 2007 the balance of our deferred tax asset increased substantially from 3740 million at september 30 2006 to 8638 million at september 30 2007 

 

homebuilding results by reporting region 

 

east region  — homebuilding revenues decreased 22 in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to a 22 decrease in the number of homes closed as well as a slight decrease in the average selling price of those homes the region reported a loss before income taxes of 661 million in 2007 compared to income of 1129 million in 2006 the loss in fiscal 2007 was primarily due to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs totaling 815 million and goodwill impairment charges of 394 million a decrease in the region’s gross profit from home sales as a percentage of home sales revenue home sales gross profit percentage of 450 basis points in 2007 compared to 2006 also contributed to the reduction in income before income taxes the home sales gross profit percentage decline in our south carolina and new jersey markets had the greatest impact on the overall decrease in the region’s profitability 

 

midwest region  — homebuilding revenues decreased 38 in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to a 42 decrease in the number of homes closed partially offset by a slight increase in the average selling price of those homes the region reported a loss before income taxes of 2053 million in 2007 compared to income of 1113 million in 2006 the loss in fiscal 2007 was primarily due to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs totaling 1673 million and goodwill impairment charges of 485 million the majority of the inventory impairments relate to projects in our denver market a decrease in the region’s home sales gross profit percentage of 210 basis points in 2007 compared to 2006 as well as an increase in construction defect expense in denver also contributed to the reduction in income before income taxes 

 

southeast region  — homebuilding revenues decreased 28 in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to a 24 decrease in the number of homes closed as well as a 6 decrease in the average selling price of those homes the region reported a loss before income taxes of 1316 million in 2007 compared to income of 3464 million in 2006 the loss in fiscal 2007 was primarily due to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs totaling 2102 million and goodwill impairment charges of 115 million a decrease in the region’s home sales gross profit percentage of 1140 basis points in 2007 compared to 2006 also contributed to the reduction in income before income taxes the home sales gross profit percentage decline in our florida markets had the greatest impact on the overall decrease the florida markets experienced rapid price increases in previous years which contributed to gross profit increases in 2005 and continued elevated gross profit in 2006 in 2007 high inventory levels of new and existing homes and increased levels of sales incentives and home price reductions were typical throughout florida resulting in substantial gross profit declines 

 

south central region  — homebuilding revenues decreased 13 in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to a 16 decrease in the number of homes closed partially offset by a 5 increase in the average selling price of those homes income before income taxes for the region was 1222 million in 2007 down 29 from 2006 income before income taxes as a percentage of the region’s revenues operating margin decreased 130 basis points to 61 from 74 in 2006 the decrease in operating margin in 2007 was primarily due to 

a decrease in the region’s home sales gross profit percentage of 70 basis points in 2007 compared to 2006 the home sales gross profit change was largely due to softening in the san antonio market where inventories of new and existing homes increased resulting in increased levels of sales incentives being offered by builders the recording of inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs totaling 246 million in fiscal 2007 compared to 22 million in 2006 also contributed to the decline in the region’s profitability 

 

southwest region  — homebuilding revenues remained relatively flat decreasing only 1 in 2007 compared to 2006 due to a 7 decrease in the average selling price of homes closed partially offset by a 4 increase in the number of homes closed income before income taxes for the region was 1929 million in 2007 down 54 from 2006 operating margin decreased 1160 basis points to 102 from 218 in 2006 the decrease in operating margin in 2007 was primarily due to a decrease in the region’s home sales gross profit percentage of 1130 basis points in 2007 compared to 2006 the home sales gross profit change was largely due to declines in our phoenix market the phoenix market experienced significant price increases in previous years which contributed to gross profit increases in 2005 and continued elevated gross profit in 2006 in 2007 higher inventory levels of new and existing homes and increased sales incentives and home price reductions were more common in phoenix resulting in gross profit declines the recording of inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs totaling 268 million in fiscal 2007 compared to 48 million in 2006 also contributed to the decline in the region’s profitability 

 

west region  — homebuilding revenues decreased 34 in 2007 compared to 2006 due to a 34 decrease in the number of homes closed as well as a slight decrease in the average selling price of those homes the region reported a loss before income taxes of 9321 million in 2007 compared to income of 7206 million in 2006 the loss in fiscal 2007 was primarily due to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs totaling 8191 million and goodwill impairment charges of 3747 million the majority of the inventory impairments relate to projects in our california and las vegas markets a decrease in the region’s home sales gross profit percentage of 790 basis points in 2007 compared to 2006 also contributed to the reduction in income before income taxes the home sales gross profit percentage declines in our california and las vegas markets had the greatest impact on the overall decrease the california and las vegas markets experienced rapid significant home price increases in previous years which contributed to gross profit increases in 2005 and continued elevated gross profit in 2006 but these price increases also strained housing affordability for many potential homebuyers in those markets credit tightening in the mortgage markets also significantly limited the availability of many mortgage products used extensively by california and las vegas homebuyers in the previous years in 2006 and 2007 inventory levels of new and existing homes in these markets were high and increased levels of sales incentives and home price reductions were typical in new home communities as builders attempted to increase demand for homes and address affordability concerns resulting in gross profit declines 

results of operations — financial services 

 

fiscal year ended september 30 2008 compared to fiscal year ended september 30 2007 

 

the following tables set forth key operating and financial data for our financial services operations comprising dhi mortgage and our subsidiary title companies for the fiscal years ended september 30 2008 and 2007 

 

 

 

 

 

financial services operating margin analysis 

 

 

 

mortgage loan activity 

 

the volume of loans originated and brokered by our mortgage operations is directly related to the number and value of homes closed by our homebuilding operations total firstlien loans originated or brokered by dhi mortgage for our homebuyers decreased by 41 in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 corresponding to 

the decrease in the number of homes closed of 36 the percentage decrease in loans originated was greater than the percentage decrease in homes closed due to a decline in our mortgage capture rate the percentage of total home closings by our homebuilding operations for which dhi mortgage handled the homebuyers’ financing to 61 in 2008 from 66 in 2007 as dhi mortgage reduced the number of homebuilding markets it supports home closings from our homebuilding operations constituted 92 of dhi mortgage loan originations in 2008 compared to 95 in 2007 reflecting dhi mortgage’s continued focus on supporting the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations the number of loans sold to thirdparty investors decreased by 50 in 2008 as compared to 2007 the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the number of mortgage loans originated 

 

consistent with the second half of fiscal 2007 originations during fiscal 2008 continued to be predominantly traditional conforming conventional loans and fha or va insured loans 

 

financial services revenues and expenses 

 

revenues from the financial services segment decreased 39 to 1275 million in 2008 from 2077 million in 2007 the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the number of mortgage loans originated and sold although during fiscal 2008 the effect of decreased loan volume was partially offset by the recognition of an additional 88 million of revenues related to the adoption of staff accounting bulletin no 109 “written loan commitments recorded at fair value through earnings” sab 109 on january 1 2008 sab 109 requires that the expected net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of a loan are included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings at the time of commitment additionally we increased our loan loss reserve from 246 million at september 30 2007 to 305 million at september 30 2008 to provide for estimated losses predominantly on loans held in portfolio and loans held for sale charges related to recourse obligations declined to 219 million in fiscal 2008 from 260 million in fiscal 2007 recourse expense is included as a component of gains from sale of mortgages 

 

general and administrative ga expense associated with financial services decreased 35 to 1001 million in 2008 from 1538 million in 2007 the largest component of our financial services ga expense is employee compensation and related costs which represented 71 and 75 of ga costs in 2008 and 2007 respectively those costs decreased 38 to 708 million in 2008 from 1149 million in 2007 as we have continued to align the number of employees with current and anticipated loan origination and title service levels our financial services operations employed approximately 700 and 1100 employees at september 30 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

as a percentage of financial services revenues ga expense increased by 450 basis points to 785 in 2008 from 740 in 2007 the increase was primarily due to the reduction in revenue resulting from the decrease in mortgage loan volume during fiscal 2008 and was partially offset by the effect of the additional revenue recognized upon adopting sab 109 in fiscal 2008 fluctuations in financial services ga expense as a percentage of revenues can be expected to occur due to changes in the amount of revenue earned as some expenses are not directly related to mortgage loan volume 

 

interest expense is directly related to the average level of our financial services debt outstanding during the period comparing fiscal 2008 with fiscal 2007 interest expense related to financial services debt decreased by 84 to 37 million primarily due to an 87 decrease in our average financial services debt 

 

interest and other income decreased 70 to 114 million in 2008 from 385 million in 2007 primarily due to the decreased volume of loan originations 

fiscal year ended september 30 2007 compared to fiscal year ended september 30 2006

financial services operating margin analysis 

 

 

 

mortgage loan activity 

 

total firstlien loans originated or brokered by dhi mortgage for our homebuyers decreased by 24 in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 corresponding to the decrease in the number of homes closed of 22 the percentage decrease in loans originated was greater than the percentage decrease in homes closed due to a decline in our mortgage capture rate to 66 in 2007 from 68 in 2006 home closings from our homebuilding operations constituted 95 of dhi mortgage loan originations in 2007 compared to 94 in 

2006 reflecting dhi mortgage’s continued focus on supporting the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations the number of loans sold to thirdparty investors decreased by 29 in 2007 as compared to 2006 the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the number of mortgage loans originated 

 

during fiscal 2007 the market for certain nontraditional mortgage loans changed substantially resulting in the reduced availability of some loan products that had previously been available to borrowers the affected loan products were generally characterized by high combined loantovalue ratios in combination with less required documentation than traditional mortgage loans such loans constituted approximately half of our total originations during fiscal 2006 but these products declined substantially as a percentage of total originations during fiscal 2007 primarily in the third and fourth quarters as a percentage of total loans originated originations of traditional conforming conventional loans and fha or va insured loans increased significantly during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 to approximately 90 corresponding to the reduction in nontraditional mortgage loans 

 

financial services revenues and expenses 

 

revenues from the financial services segment decreased 29 to 2077 million in 2007 from 2908 million in 2006 the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the number of mortgage loans originated and sold additionally we increased our loan loss reserve from 156 million at september 30 2006 to 246 million at september 30 2007 to provide for estimated losses predominantly on loans held in portfolio and loans held for sale the increase in this reserve resulted in a corresponding decrease to the gains on sale of mortgages and reflects the market conditions related to nontraditional products as described above as well as potential repurchase obligations that exist on certain loans previously sold 

 

ga expense associated with financial services decreased 24 to 1538 million in 2007 from 2022 million in 2006 the largest component of our financial services ga expense is employee compensation and related costs which represented 75 and 77 of ga costs in 2007 and 2006 respectively those costs decreased 26 to 1149 million in 2007 from 1554 million in 2006 as we aligned the number of employees with the then current and anticipated loan origination and title service levels our financial services operations employed approximately 1100 and 1700 employees at september 30 2007 and 2006 respectively 

 

as a percentage of financial services revenues ga expense increased by 450 basis points to 740 in 2007 from 695 in 2006 the increase was primarily due to the reduction in revenue resulting from the decrease in mortgage loan volume during fiscal 2007 and an increase in loan loss expense discussed above fluctuations in financial services ga expense as a percentage of revenues can be expected to occur due to changes in the amount of revenue earned as some expenses are not directly related to mortgage loan volume 

 

interest and other income decreased 32 to 385 million in 2007 from 569 million in 2006 primarily due to the decreased volume of loan originations 

 

overview of current capital resources and liquidity 

 

we have historically funded our homebuilding and financial services operations with cash flows from operating activities borrowings under our bank credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities as we have utilized our capital resources and liquidity to fund our operations we have focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet 

 

at september 30 2008 our ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital was 436 an increase of 340 basis points from 402 at september 30 2007 net homebuilding debt to total capital consists of homebuilding notes payable net of cash divided by total capital net of cash homebuilding notes payable net of cash plus stockholders’ equity the increase in our ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital at september 30 2008 as compared with the ratio a year earlier was primarily due to the decrease in retained earnings which was partially offset by our higher cash balance and lower debt balance resulting from the generation of cash flows from operations our ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital remains within 

our target operating range of below 45 we believe that our strong balance sheet and liquidity position will allow us to be flexible in reacting to changing market conditions however future periodend net homebuilding debt to total capital ratios may be higher than the 436 ratio achieved at september 30 2008 

 

we believe that the ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital is useful in understanding the leverage employed in our homebuilding operations and comparing us with other homebuilders we exclude the debt of our financial services business because it is separately capitalized and its obligation under its repurchase agreement is substantially collateralized and not guaranteed by our parent company or any of our homebuilding entities because of its capital function we include homebuilding cash as a reduction of our homebuilding debt and total capital for comparison to our ratios of net homebuilding debt to capital above at september 30 2008 and 2007 our ratios of homebuilding debt to total capital without netting cash balances were 556 and 417 respectively 

 

we believe that we will be able to fund our shortterm working capital needs for our homebuilding and financial services operations and our fiscal 2009 debt maturities through existing cash resources and the cash flows from operations we expect to generate in fiscal 2009 although we do not currently anticipate a need to borrow from our revolving credit facility in fiscal 2009 we are currently exploring alternatives with regard to the facility which could potentially include an amendment to the current agreement for the longer term in addition to utilizing existing cash resources and cash flows generated from operations in the future we expect to fund our operations through a renewed or amended credit facility and if needed the issuance of new securities through the public capital markets subject to market conditions 

 

homebuilding capital resources 

 

cash and cash equivalents  — at september 30 2008 we had available homebuilding cash and cash equivalents of 14 billion 

 

bank credit facility and indentures  — we have a 165 billion unsecured revolving credit facility which includes a 10 billion letter of credit subfacility the revolving credit facility which matures on december 16 2011 has an uncommitted accordion provision of 400 million which could be used to increase the size of the facility to 205 billion upon obtaining additional commitments from lenders our borrowing capacity including the issuance of letters of credit under this facility is reduced by the amount of letters of credit outstanding and is currently further reduced by the limitations in effect under the borrowing base arrangement to 528 million as more fully described below the facility is guaranteed by substantially all of our whollyowned subsidiaries other than our financial services subsidiaries borrowings bear interest at rates based upon the london interbank offered rate libor plus a spread based upon our leverage ratio as defined in our credit agreement our ratio of adjusted ebitda to adjusted interest incurred and our senior unsecured debt rating we may borrow funds through the revolving credit facility throughout the year to fund working capital requirements and we repay such borrowings with cash generated from our operations and in the past from the issuance of public securities at september 30 2008 we had no cash borrowings and 716 million of standby letters of credit outstanding on our homebuilding revolving credit facility and the interest rate was 55 in addition to the stated interest rates the revolving credit facility requires us to pay certain fees 

 

in january 2008 through an amendment to the credit agreement the size of the revolving credit facility was reduced from 25 billion to 225 billion the amendment also revised certain financial covenants including reducing the required level of minimum tangible net worth and reducing the maximum leverage ratio additionally the amendment modified the adjusted ebitda to adjusted interest incurred covenant such that it can no longer result in an event of default 

 

in june 2008 through an amendment to the credit agreement the size of the revolving credit facility was reduced from 225 billion to 165 billion the amendment further reduced the minimum tangible net worth requirement and modified the leverage ratio calculation in addition the amendment increased the maximum residential land and lots to tangible net worth ratio and modified tangible net worth to include certain capital stock the amendment also changed the pricing terms of our revolving credit facility whereby the interest rate spread on borrowings and on unused committed capacity was increased 

under the debt covenants associated with our revolving credit facility if we have fewer than two investment grade senior unsecured debt ratings from moody’s investors service fitch ratings and standard and poor’s ratings services we are subject to a borrowing base limitation and restrictions on unsold homes and residential land and lots during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 both standard  poor’s and moody’s downgraded our senior debt rating to below investment grade status therefore these additional limitations became effective and are currently in effect during the third quarter of fiscal 2008 our senior debt rating was downgraded by all three rating agencies and on november 26 2008 was further downgraded by moody’s and standard  poor’s to their current levels as follows moody’s ba3 standard  poor’s bb− and fitch bb 

 

under the borrowing base limitation the sum of our senior debt and the amount drawn on our revolving credit facility may not exceed the lesser of a certain percentages of the acquisition cost of various categories of our unencumbered inventory or b certain percentages of the book value of various categories of our unencumbered inventory cash and cash equivalents at september 30 2008 the borrowing base arrangement limited our additional borrowing capacity from any source including the issuance of letters of credit to 528 million reductions of outstanding debt will increase our capacity under the borrowing base while reductions of inventory will generally decrease our borrowing base capacity consequently to the extent our debt balance declines at a faster pace than further inventory reductions we would expect our capacity to increase under the borrowing base based on our current cash balance and expectations for cash flows we currently do not anticipate a need to borrow from our revolving credit facility in the near term however we are exploring alternatives with regard to this credit facility which could potentially include an amendment to the current agreement 

 

the revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on our operations and activities by requiring us to maintain certain levels of leverage tangible net worth and components of inventory if we do not maintain the requisite levels we may not be able to pay dividends or available financing could be reduced or terminated in addition the indentures governing our senior notes and senior subordinated notes impose restrictions on the creation of secured debt 

 

based on the terms of the credit agreement as amended in june 2008 the following table presents the revised levels required to maintain our compliance with the financial covenants associated with our revolving credit facility and the levels achieved as of and for the period ended september 30 2008 these covenants are measured at the end of each fiscal quarter they are required to be maintained by us and all of our direct and indirect subsidiaries collectively guarantor subsidiaries other than the financial services subsidiaries and certain inconsequential subsidiaries collectively nonguarantor subsidiaries 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

  

prior to june 20 2008 our senior subordinated notes indenture contained restrictions that became operative if our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the indenture for four fiscal quarters was not at least 20 to 10 if we failed to satisfy this ratio we would have been precluded from making certain restricted payments including dividends and incurring additional debt other than certain refinancing indebtedness purchase money indebtedness or other permitted indebtedness that were not dependent on this ratio including 1 billion principal amount of indebtedness under our revolving credit facility at any time outstanding 

 

in may 2008 we commenced an offer to exchange any and all of our outstanding 975 senior subordinated notes due 2010 for an equal principal amount of new 975 senior notes due 2010 in conjunction with the exchange offer we solicited consents to an amendment to the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes that would eliminate many of the restrictive covenants applicable to the senior subordinated notes as described above for each 1000 principal amount of senior subordinated notes tendered prior to the expiration of the consent solicitation on june 4 2008 holders received a consent payment of 10 on june 20 2008 the exchange offer and related solicitation of consents to amend the indenture closed with 968 million principal amount of the senior subordinated notes having been tendered for exchange and 167 million principal amount of the 975 senior subordinated notes remaining under the amended indenture as a result of the amendment to the indenture many of the restrictive covenants contained in the indenture were eliminated including the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio discussed above 

 

at september 30 2008 we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants limitations and restrictions that form a part of the bank revolving credit facility and the public debt obligations however the margin by which we have complied with the tangible net worth covenant of our revolving credit facility has 

declined if our operating results and inventory impairments continue at recent levels our tangible net worth may decline below the minimum level required by the revolving credit facility during fiscal 2009 consequently we intend to seek an amendment to our revolving credit facility to modify the covenant provisions included in the credit facility before our tangible net worth declines below the minimum required level the amendment may also include among other things a reduction in the commitment amount under the facility and price increases on borrowings and unused commitment amounts we cannot assure that we will be successful in these efforts or that the terms or amount of any revised financing will not have an adverse effect on us our business capital resources or financial results 

 

repayments of public unsecured debt — on december 1 2007 we repaid the 215 million principal amount of our 75 senior notes which became due on that date 

 

in february 2008 through an unsolicited transaction we repurchased 365 million principal amount of our 975 senior subordinated notes due 2010 for a purchase price of 360 million plus accrued interest the gain of 05 million is included in homebuilding other income in our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2008 

 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 through unsolicited transactions we repurchased 353 million principal amount of our 8 senior notes due 2009 at their face value plus accrued interest and 140 million principal amount of our 975 senior subordinated notes due 2010 for a purchase price of 136 million plus accrued interest 

 

in november 2008 through unsolicited transactions we repurchased a total of 1029 million principal amount of various issues of our senior notes due in 2009 and 2010 for an aggregate purchase price of 982 million 

 

shelf registration statements — we have an automatically effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec registering debt and equity securities which we may issue from time to time in amounts to be determined also at september 30 2008 we had the capacity to issue approximately 225 million shares of common stock under our acquisition shelf registration statement to effect in whole or in part possible future business acquisitions 

 

financial services capital resources 

 

cash and cash equivalents  — at september 30 2008 we had available financial services cash and cash equivalents of 317 million 

 

mortgage warehouse loan facility  — dhi mortgage had a 540 million mortgage warehouse loan facility that matured march 28 2008 this facility was not renewed upon maturity but was replaced with the mortgage repurchase facility described below 

 

commercial paper conduit facility  — dhi mortgage had a 600 million commercial paper conduit facility the “cp conduit facility” with a maturity date of june 27 2009 effective april 1 2008 the cp conduit facility was voluntarily terminated by agreement of the parties 

 

mortgage repurchase facility  — on march 28 2008 dhi mortgage entered into a mortgage sale and repurchase agreement the “mortgage repurchase facility” that matures march 26 2009 the mortgage repurchase facility which replaced the mortgage warehouse loan facility provides financing and liquidity to dhi mortgage by facilitating purchase transactions in which dhi mortgage transfers eligible loans to the counterparties against the transfer of funds by the counterparties thereby becoming purchased loans dhi mortgage then has the right and obligation to repurchase the purchased loans upon their sale to third party investors in the secondary market or upon a specified time per the terms of the mortgage repurchase facility as of september 30 2008 3337 million of mortgage loans held for sale were pledged under this repurchase arrangement the mortgage repurchase facility is accounted for as a secured financing the facility has a capacity of 275 million subject to an accordion feature that could increase the total capacity to 500 million based on obtaining increased committed sums from existing counterparties new commitments from prospective counterparties or a combination of both in addition dhi mortgage has the option to fund a 

portion of its repurchase obligations in advance as a result of advance fundings totaling 1069 million dhi mortgage had an obligation of 2035 million outstanding under the mortgage repurchase facility at september 30 2008 at a 49 interest rate 

 

the mortgage repurchase facility is not guaranteed by either dr horton inc or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt the facility contains financial covenants as to the mortgage subsidiary’s minimum required tangible net worth its maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth its minimum required net income and its minimum required liquidity at september 30 2008 our mortgage subsidiary was in compliance with all of the conditions and covenants of the mortgage repurchase facility however the margin by which we have complied with the minimum required net income covenant of this facility has declined if our financial services operating results continue at current levels this calculation may decline below the required level before the expiration date of the facility consequently we intend to seek an amendment to our mortgage repurchase facility to modify the covenant provisions included in the facility before then we cannot assure that we will be successful in these efforts or that the terms or amount of any revised financing will not have an adverse effect on us our business capital resources or financial results 

 

in the past we have been able to renew or extend our mortgage credit facilities on satisfactory terms prior to their maturities and obtain temporary additional commitments through amendments of the respective credit agreements during periods of higher than normal volumes of mortgages held for sale the recent volatility in the credit markets and losses sustained by many banks will likely make renewing this facility more challenging and more expensive the liquidity of our financial services business depends upon our continued ability to renew and extend the mortgage repurchase facility or to obtain other additional financing in sufficient capacities 

 

operating cash flow activities 

 

during the year ended september 30 2008 net cash provided by our operating activities was 19 billion as compared to 14 billion during the prior year during fiscal 2008 we continued to limit our investments in inventory as evidenced by a 21 billion decrease in owned inventory excluding the impact of impairments and writeoffs during the fiscal year compared to a 7376 million decrease in fiscal 2007 in light of the challenging market conditions we have substantially slowed our purchases of land and lots and our development spending on land we own and have restricted the number of homes under construction to better match our expected rate of home sales and closings we plan to continue to restrict our number of homes under construction and significantly limit our development spending during fiscal 2009 our ability to reduce our inventory levels is however heavily dependent upon our ability to close a sufficient number of homes during the year which may prove difficult given the current market conditions to the extent our inventory levels decrease at planned levels during fiscal 2009 we expect to generate net positive cash flows from operating activities should all other factors remain constant however the amount of cash generated in the future may be less than in prior periods additionally we expect the receipt of our federal income tax refund of 6762 million to contribute to positive cash flow from operations in fiscal 2009 

 

another significant factor affecting our operating cash flows in fiscal 2008 was the decrease in mortgage loans held for sale of 1714 million during the year the decrease in mortgage loans held for sale was due to a decrease in the number of loans originated during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 we expect to continue to use cash to fund an increase in mortgage loans held for sale in quarters when our homebuilding closings grow however in periods when home closings are flat or decline as compared to prior periods or if our mortgage capture rate declines the amounts of net cash used may be reduced or we may generate positive cash flows from reductions in the balances of mortgage loans held for sale as we did in fiscal 2008 

 

investing cash flow activities 

 

in fiscal 2008 and 2007 cash used in investing activities represented net purchases of property and equipment primarily model home furniture and office equipment such purchases are not significant relative to our total assets or cash flows but were reduced in fiscal 2008 in light of the weaker market conditions 

financing cash flow activities 

 

the majority of our shortterm financing needs have been funded with cash generated from operations and borrowings available under our homebuilding and financial services credit facilities longterm financing needs of our homebuilding operations have been generally funded with the issuance of new senior unsecured debt securities through the public capital markets our homebuilding senior and senior subordinated notes and borrowings under our homebuilding revolving credit facility are guaranteed by substantially all of our whollyowned subsidiaries other than our financial services subsidiaries 

 

during fiscal 2008 our board of directors approved two quarterly cash dividends of 015 per common share and two quarterly cash dividends of 0075 per common share the last of which was paid on august 28 2008 to stockholders of record on august 18 2008 quarterly cash dividends of 015 per common share were paid in each quarter of fiscal 2007 on november 20 2008 our board of directors approved a cash dividend of 00375 per common share payable on december 18 2008 to stockholders of record on december 8 2008 the declaration of future cash dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon among other things future earnings cash flows capital requirements our financial condition and general business conditions as well as compliance with covenants contained in our revolving credit agreement 

 

changes in capital structure 

 

in november 2007 our board of directors extended its authorizations for the repurchase of up to 4632 million of our common stock and the repurchase of debt securities of up to 500 million to november 30 2008 through unsolicited transactions during fiscal 2008 we repurchased 379 million principal amount of our 975 senior subordinated notes due 2010 and 353 million principal amount of our 8 senior notes due 2009 which reduced the remaining debt repurchase authorization to 4268 million at september 30 2008 upon expiration of the november 2007 authorizations our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 100 million of our common stock and the repurchase of up to 500 million of debt securities the new authorizations are effective from december 1 2008 to november 30 2009 

 

in fiscal 2008 our primary nonoperating uses of our available capital were the repayment of debt and dividend payments we expect the repayment of debt to remain a significant priority for the use of cash in fiscal 2009 we continue to evaluate our alternatives for future nonoperating uses of our available capital including the amounts of planned debt repayments dividend payments and maintenance of cash balances based on market conditions and other circumstances and within the constraints of our balance sheet leverage targets our liquidity targets and the restrictions in our bank agreements 

 

contractual cash obligations commercial commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

our primary contractual cash obligations for our homebuilding and financial services segments are payments under shortterm and longterm debt agreements and lease payments under operating leases purchase obligations of our homebuilding segment represent specific performance requirements under lot option purchase agreements that may require us to purchase land contingent upon the land seller meeting certain obligations we expect to fund our contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business through a combination of our existing cash resources cash flows generated from operations renewed or amended credit facilities and if needed the issuance of new securities through the public capital markets subject to market conditions 

our future cash requirements for contractual obligations as of september 30 2008 are presented below 

 

 

 

 

  

at september 30 2008 our homebuilding operations had outstanding letters of credit of 716 million and surety bonds of 16 billion issued by third parties to secure performance under various contracts we expect that our performance obligations secured by these letters of credit and bonds will generally be completed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms when we complete our performance obligations the related letters of credit and bonds are generally released shortly thereafter leaving us with no continuing obligations we have no material thirdparty guarantees 

 

our mortgage subsidiary enters into various commitments related to the lending activities of our mortgage operations further discussion of these commitments is provided in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” under part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts to procure land or lots for the construction of homes lot option contracts enable us to control significant lot positions with limited capital investment and substantially reduce the risks associated with land ownership and development within the land and lot option purchase contracts in force at september 30 2008 there were a limited number of contracts representing only 480 million of remaining purchase price subject to specific performance clauses which may require us to purchase the land or lots upon the land sellers meeting their obligations we consolidated certain variable interest entities with assets of 217 million related to some of our outstanding land and lot option purchase contracts creditors if any of these variable interest entities have no recourse against us additionally pursuant to sfas no 49 “accounting for product financing arrangements” we recorded 169 million of land inventory not owned related to some of our outstanding land and lot option purchase contracts further discussion of our land option contracts is provided in the “land and lot position and homes in inventory” section that follows 

land and lot position and homes in inventory 

 

the following is a summary of our land and lot position and homes in inventory at september 30 2008 and 2007 

 

 

 

at september 30 2008 we owned or controlled approximately 125000 lots 21 of which were lots under option or similar contracts compared with approximately 230000 lots at september 30 2007 our current strategy is to continue to reduce our owned and controlled lot position in line with our reduced expectations for future home sales and closings through the construction and sale of homes and sales of land and lots along with critical evaluation of acquiring lots currently controlled under option or in opportunistically acquired new lot positions 

 

at september 30 2008 we controlled approximately 26000 lots with a total remaining purchase price of approximately 7323 million under land and lot option purchase contracts with a total of 509 million in earnest money deposits our lots controlled included approximately 8000 optioned lots with a remaining purchase price of approximately 2479 million and secured by deposits totaling 234 million for which we do not expect to exercise our option to purchase the land or lots but the contract has not yet been terminated consequently we have written off the deposits related to these contracts resulting in a net earnest money deposit balance of 275 million at september 30 2008 

 

we had a total of approximately 12400 homes in inventory including approximately 1500 model homes at september 30 2008 compared to approximately 19900 homes in inventory including approximately 2000 model homes at september 30 2007 of our total homes in inventory approximately 6900 and 10600 were unsold at september 30 2008 and 2007 respectively at september 30 2008 approximately 3100 of our unsold homes were completed of which approximately 1100 homes had been completed for more than six months at september 30 2007 approximately 5000 of our unsold homes were completed of which approximately 1100 homes had been completed for more than six months our strategy is to continue to restrict and adjust our total number of homes in inventory and our number of unsold homes in inventory during fiscal 2009 as necessary to match our reduced expectations for future home sales and closings in addition we will continue our efforts to opportunistically sell excess land and lot positions in certain markets 

 

seasonality 

 

we have typically experienced seasonal variations in our quarterly operating results and capital requirements before the current housing downturn we generally had more homes under construction closed more homes and had greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year this seasonal activity increased our working capital requirements for our homebuilding operations during the third and fourth fiscal quarters and increased our funding requirements for the mortgages we originated in our financial services segment at the end of these quarters as a result of seasonal activity our results of 

operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year 

 

in contrast to our typical seasonal results due to further deterioration of homebuilding market conditions during the last two years we incurred consolidated operating losses in our third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2007 and in all quarters of fiscal 2008 these results were primarily due to recording significant inventory and goodwill impairment charges also the increasingly challenging market conditions caused declines in sales volume pricing and margins that mitigated our historical seasonal variations although we may experience our typical historical seasonal pattern in the future given the current market conditions we can make no assurances as to when or whether this pattern will recur 

 

inflation 

 

we and the homebuilding industry in general may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation primarily because of higher land financing labor and material construction costs in addition higher mortgage interest rates can significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers we attempt to pass through to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices however during periods of soft housing market conditions we may not be able to offset our cost increases particularly higher land costs with higher selling prices 

 

forwardlooking statements 

 

some of the statements contained in this report as well as in other materials we have filed or will file with the sec statements made by us in periodic press releases and oral statements we make to analysts stockholders and the press in the course of presentations about us may be construed as “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 and the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 forwardlooking statements are based on management’s beliefs as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to management these forwardlooking statements typically include the words “anticipate” “believe” “consider” “estimate” “expect” “forecast” “goal” “intend” “objective” “plan” “predict” “projection” “seek” “strategy” “target” or other words of similar meaning any or all of the forwardlooking statements included in this report and in any other of our reports or public statements may not approximate actual experience and the expectations derived from them may not be realized due to risks uncertainties and other factors as a result actual results may differ materially from the expectations or results we discuss in the forwardlooking statements these risks uncertainties and other factors include but are not limited to

we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise however any further disclosures made on related subjects in subsequent reports on forms 10k 10q and 8k should be consulted further discussion of these and other risk considerations is provided in item 1a “risk factors” under part i of this annual report on form 10k 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

general  — a comprehensive enumeration of the significant accounting policies of dr horton inc and subsidiaries is presented in note a to the accompanying financial statements as of september 30 2008 and 2007 and for the years ended september 30 2008 2007 and 2006 each of our accounting policies has been chosen based upon current authoritative literature that collectively comprises us generally accepted accounting principles gaap in instances where alternative methods of accounting are permissible under gaap we have chosen the method that most appropriately reflects the nature of our business the results of our operations and our financial condition and have consistently applied those methods over each of the periods presented in the financial statements the audit committee of our board of directors has reviewed and approved the accounting policies selected 

 

basis of presentation  — our financial statements include the accounts of dr horton inc and all of its whollyowned majorityowned and controlled subsidiaries we have also consolidated certain variable interest entities from which we are purchasing lots under option purchase contracts under the requirements of interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities — an interpretation of arb no 51” as amended fin 46r issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb all significant intercompany accounts transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation 

 

use of estimates  — the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ materially from those estimates 

 

revenue recognition  — we generally recognize homebuilding revenue and related profit at the time of the closing of a sale when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer in situations where the buyer’s financing is originated by dhi mortgage our whollyowned mortgage subsidiary and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment as prescribed by sfas no 66 the profit on such sales is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a thirdparty investor has been completed also in accordance with sfas no 66 the recognition of land sales is deferred when the full accrual method criteria is not met we include amounts in transit from title companies at the end of each reporting period in homebuilding cash when we execute sales contracts with our homebuyers or when we require advance payment from homebuyers for custom changes upgrades or options related to their homes we record the cash deposits received as liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are canceled we either retain or refund to the homebuyer deposits on canceled sales contracts depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances 

 

we recognize financial services revenues associated with our title operations as closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued both of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed we transfer substantially all underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies to thirdparty insurers origination fees and direct origination costs are deferred and recognized as revenues and expenses respectively along with the associated gains and losses on the sales of the loans when the loans are sold to third party investors as required by sab 109 issued by the sec in november 2007 the expected net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of a loan are included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings at the time of commitment sab 109 was effective for us on january 1 2008 and has been applied prospectively to commitments issued or modified after that date we generally do not retain or service the mortgages that we originate but rather seek to sell 

the mortgages and related servicing rights to thirdparty investors interest income is earned from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold 

 

mortgage loans held for sale are carried at cost adjusted for changes in fair value after the date of designation of an effective accounting hedge based on either sale commitments or current market quotes some loans are sold with limited recourse provisions based on historical experience and current housing and credit market conditions we estimate and record a total loss reserve predominantly for mortgage loans held in portfolio and mortgage loans held for sale unhedged loans or those not in a designated accounting hedge are stated at the lower of cost or market market is determined by either sales commitments or current market conditions 

 

inventories and cost of sales  — inventory includes the costs of direct land acquisition land development and home construction capitalized interest real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and home construction applicable direct overhead costs that we incur after development projects or homes are substantially complete such as utilities maintenance and cleaning are charged to sga expense as incurred all indirect overhead costs such as compensation of sales personnel and division and region management advertising and builder’s risk insurance are charged to sga expense as incurred 

 

land and development costs are typically allocated to individual residential lots on a prorata basis and the costs of residential lots are transferred to construction in progress when home construction begins we use the specific identification method for the purpose of accumulating home construction costs cost of sales for homes closed includes the specific construction costs of each home and all applicable land acquisition land development and related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each community any changes to the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial home closings in a community are generally allocated on a prorata basis to the remaining homes in the community 

 

when a home is closed we generally have not yet paid and recorded all incurred costs necessary to complete the home each month we record as a liability and as a charge to cost of sales the amount we determine will ultimately be paid related to completed homes that have been closed as of the end of that month we compare our home construction budgets to actual recorded costs to determine the additional costs remaining to be paid on each closed home we monitor the accuracy of each month’s accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on closed homes in subsequent months to the amount previously accrued although actual costs to be paid in the future on previously closed homes could differ from our current accruals historically differences in amounts have not been significant 

 

in accordance with sfas no 144 land inventory and related communities under development are reviewed for potential writedowns when impairment indicators are present we generally review our inventory at the community level and the inventory within each community may be categorized as land held for development residential land and lots developed and under development and construction in progress and finished homes based on the stage of production or plans for future development a particular community often includes inventory in more than one category in certain situations inventory may be analyzed separately for impairment purposes based on its product type eg single family homes evaluated separately from condominium parcels in reviewing each of our communities we determine if impairment indicators exist on inventory held and used by analyzing a variety of factors including but not limited to the following 

 

 60 

 

if indicators of impairment are present for a community sfas no 144 requires an analysis to determine if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts and if so impairment charges are required to be recorded if the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying amounts these estimates of cash flows are significantly impacted by community specific factors including estimates of the amounts and timing of future revenues and estimates of the amount of land development materials and labor costs which in turn may be impacted by the following local market conditions 

 

  

for those assets deemed to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets our determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams when an impairment charge for a community is determined the charge is then allocated to each lot in the community in the same manner as land and development costs are allocated to each lot the inventory within each community is categorized as construction in progress and finished homes residential land and lots — developed and under development and land held for development based on the stage of production or plans for future development 

 

we generally do not purchase land for resale however when we own land or communities under development that no longer fit into our development and construction plans and we determine that the best use of the asset is the sale of the asset the project is accounted for as land held for sale assuming the land held for sale criteria defined in sfas no 144 are met we record land held for sale at the lesser of its carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell in performing impairment evaluation for land held for sale we consider several factors including but not limited to prices for land in recent comparable sales transactions market analysis studies which include the estimated price a willing buyer would pay for the land and recent legitimate offers received if the estimated fair value less cost to sell an asset is less than the current carrying value the asset is written down to its estimated fair value less cost to sell 

 

in accordance with sfas no 144 impairment charges are also recorded on finished homes in substantially completed communities when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values are greater than the fair value less estimated costs to sell these homes 

 

the key assumptions relating to the valuations are impacted by local market economic conditions and the actions of competitors and are inherently uncertain due to uncertainties in the estimation process actual results could differ from such estimates our quarterly assessments reflect management’s estimates and we continue to monitor the fair value of heldforsale assets through the disposition date 

 

land and lot option purchase contracts  — in the ordinary course of our homebuilding business we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts to procure land or lots for the construction of homes under such option purchase contracts we will fund a stated deposit in consideration for the right but not the obligation to purchase land or lots at a future point in time with predetermined terms under the terms of the option purchase contracts many of our option deposits are not refundable at our discretion 

 

option deposits and preacquisition costs we incur related to our land and lot option purchase contracts are capitalized in accordance with sfas no 67 “accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real 

estate projects” if all of the following conditions have been met 1 the costs are directly identifiable with the specific property 2 the costs would be capitalized if the property were already acquired and 3 acquisition of the property is probable meaning we are actively seeking and have the ability to acquire the property and there is no indication that the property is not available for sale we also consider the following when determining if the acquisition of the property is probable 1 changes in market conditions subsequent to contracting for the purchase of the land 2 current contract terms including per lot price and required purchase dates and 3 our current land position in the given market or submarket option deposits and capitalized preacquisition costs are expensed to cost of sales when we believe it is probable that we will no longer acquire the land or lots under option and will not be able to recover these costs through other means 

 

we also evaluate our land and lot option purchase contracts in accordance with the provisions of fin 46r fin 46r provides guidance for the financial accounting and reporting of interests in certain variable interest entities which fin 46r defines as certain business entities that either have equity investors with voting rights disproportionate to their ownership interests or have equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entities to support their activities fin 46r requires consolidation of such entities by any company that is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the entities’ activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entities’ residual returns or both defined as the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity under the requirements of fin 46r certain of our option purchase contracts result in the creation of a variable interest in the entity holding the land parcel under option 

 

in applying the provisions of fin 46r we evaluate those land and lot option purchase contracts with variable interest entities to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary based upon analysis of the variability of the expected gains and losses of the entity based on this evaluation if we are the primary beneficiary of an entity with which we have entered into a land or lot option purchase contract the variable interest entity is consolidated 

 

since we own no equity interest in any of the unaffiliated variable interest entities that we must consolidate pursuant to fin 46r we generally have little or no control or influence over the operations of these entities or their owners when our requests for financial information are denied by the land sellers certain assumptions about the assets and liabilities of such entities are required in most cases the fair value of the assets of the consolidated entities has been assumed to be the remaining contractual purchase price of the land or lots we are purchasing in these cases it is assumed that the entities have no debt obligations and the only asset recorded is the land or lots we have the option to buy with a related offset to minority interest for the assumed third party investment in the variable interest entity creditors if any of these variable interest entities have no recourse against us 

 

goodwill  — goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over net assets acquired in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” we test goodwill for potential impairment annually as of september 30 or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the remaining balance of goodwill may not be recoverable in analyzing the potential impairment of goodwill sfas no 142 prescribes a twostep process that begins with the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units the fair value is estimated primarily utilizing the present values of expected future cash flows if the results of the first step indicate that impairment potentially exists the second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment if any impairment is determined to exist when the estimated fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value 

 

warranty costs  — we have established warranty reserves by charging cost of sales and crediting a warranty liability for each home closed we estimate the amounts charged to be adequate to cover expected warrantyrelated costs for materials and labor required under oneyear and tenyear warranty obligation periods the oneyear warranty is comprehensive for all parts and labor the tenyear period is for major construction defects our warranty cost accruals are based upon our historical warranty cost experience in each market in which we operate and are adjusted as appropriate to reflect qualitative risks associated with the type of homes we build and the geographic areas in which we build them actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts a 10 change in the historical warranty rates used to estimate our warranty accrual would not result in a material change in our accrual 

insurance claim costs  — we have and require the majority of the subcontractors we use to have general liability insurance including construction defect coverage and workers compensation insurance these insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims subject to certain selfinsured retentions deductibles and other coverage limits in some states where we believe it is too difficult or expensive for the subcontractors to obtain general liability insurance we have waived our traditional subcontractor general liability insurance requirements to obtain lower bids from subcontractors we selfinsure a portion of our overall risk partially through the use of a captive insurance entity which issues a general liability policy to us naming some subcontractors as additional insureds 

 

we record expenses and liabilities related to the costs to cover our selfinsured and deductible amounts under our insurance policies and for any estimated costs of potential claims and lawsuits including expected legal costs in excess of our coverage limits or not covered by our policies based on an analysis of our historical claims which includes an estimate of construction defect claims incurred but not yet reported projection of losses related to these liabilities is subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends in construction defect claims relative to our markets and the types of products we build claim settlement patterns insurance industry practices and legal interpretations among others because of the high degree of judgment required in determining these estimated liability amounts actual future costs could differ significantly from our currently estimated amounts a 10 increase in the claim rate and the average cost per claim used to estimate the selfinsured accruals would result in an increase of approximately 70 million in our accrual while a 10 decrease in the claim rate and the average cost per claim would result in a decrease of approximately 25 million in our accrual 

 

income taxes  — we calculate a provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” a reduction in the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance is required if based on the available evidence it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized accordingly we periodically assess the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets based on the sfas no 109 morelikelythannot realization threshold criterion in the assessment for a valuation allowance appropriate consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets this assessment considers among other matters the taxable income available in current statutory carryback periods reversals of existing taxable temporary differences tax planning strategies the nature frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses the duration of statutory carryforward periods our historical experience in generating operating profits and expectations for future profitability in making such judgments significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified sfas no 109 provides that a cumulative loss in recent years is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable and also restricts the amount of reliance on projections of future taxable income to support the recovery of deferred tax assets the accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position changes in existing tax laws could also affect actual tax results and the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 

 

on october 1 2007 we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 48 fin 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” fin 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for recognizing measuring presenting and disclosing in the financial statements tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return including the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements effective with our adoption of fin 48 interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in the financial statements as a component of the income tax provision interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits were previously included in interest expense and in selling general and administrative expense respectively significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions we evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis our evaluations are based upon a number of factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and 

effective settlement of audit issues changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change 

 

stockbased compensation  — with the approval of our compensation committee consisting of independent members of our board of directors we from time to time issue to employees and directors options to purchase our common stock the committee approves grants only out of amounts remaining available for grant from amounts formally authorized by our common stockholders we typically grant approved options with exercise prices equal to the market price of our common stock on the date of the option grant the majority of the options granted vest ratably over a tenyear period 

 

on october 1 2005 we adopted the provisions of sfas no 123r “share based payment” which requires that companies measure and recognize compensation expense at an amount equal to the fair value of sharebased payments granted under compensation arrangements we calculate the fair value of stock options using the blackscholes option pricing model determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions which involve a number of variables these variables include but are not limited to the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards the expected dividend yield and expected stock option exercise behavior in addition we also use judgment in estimating the number of sharebased awards that are expected to be forfeited 

 

recent accounting pronouncements 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” the statement defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas no 157 is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s fiscal year that begins after november 15 2007 in february 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position no fas 1572 which partially defers the effective date of sfas no 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis until fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 we have evaluated the impact of the adoption of sfas no 157 and it is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities — including an amendment of fasb statement no 115” the statement permits entities to choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings sfas no 159 is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s fiscal year that begins after november 15 2007 we have evaluated the impact of the adoption of sfas no 159 and determined that mortgage loans originated and held for sale after october 1 2008 will be accounted for at fair value while our interest rate risk management policies have not changed the effect of this standard will alleviate the documentation requirements to account for these instruments as fair value accounting hedges and we will no longer defer the recognition of net origination costs and fees the implementation of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements — an amendment of arb no 51” the statement clarifies the accounting for noncontrolling interests and establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary including classification as a component of equity sfas no 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 and earlier adoption is prohibited we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of sfas no 160 however it is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination sfas no 141r is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 and is to be applied prospectively we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 141r to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

in march 2008 the fasb issued sfas no 161 “disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities — an amendment of fasb statement no 133” the statement amends and expands the disclosure requirements of sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” it requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of gains and losses on derivative instruments and disclosures about creditriskrelated contingent features in derivative agreements sfas no 161 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november 15 2008 the principal impact of this statement will be to require us to expand the disclosure regarding our derivative instruments and will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

in may 2008 the fasb issued sfas no 162 “the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles” the statement identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements for nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with gaap sfas no 162 will be effective 60 days following the sec’s approval of the public company accounting oversight board amendments to au section 411 “the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles” we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 162 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

we are subject to interest rate risk on our longterm debt we monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and utilize both fixed and variable rate debt for fixed rate debt changes in interest rates generally affect the value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows conversely for variable rate debt changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument but may affect our future earnings and cash flows we generally do not have an obligation to prepay fixedrate debt prior to maturity and as a result interest rate risk and changes in fair value would not have a significant impact on our cash flows related to our fixedrate debt until such time as we are required to refinance repurchase or repay such debt 

 

we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with our mortgage loan origination services we manage interest rate risk through the use of forward sales of mortgagebacked securities fmbs eurodollar futures contracts edfc and put options on mortgagebacked securities mbs and edfc use of the term “hedging instruments” in the following discussion refers to these securities collectively or in any combination we do not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rate lock commitments irlcs are extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and who meet defined credit and underwriting criteria typically the irlcs have a duration of less than six months some irlcs are committed immediately to a specific investor through the use of bestefforts whole loan delivery commitments while other irlcs are funded prior to being committed to thirdparty investors the hedging instruments related to irlcs are classified and accounted for as nondesignated derivative instruments with gains and losses recognized in current earnings hedging instruments related to funded uncommitted loans are designated as fair value hedges with changes in the value of the derivative instruments recognized in current earnings along with changes in the value of the funded uncommitted loans the effectiveness of the fair value hedges is continuously monitored and any ineffectiveness which for the years ended september 30 2008 2007 and 2006 was not significant is recognized in current earnings at september 30 2008 hedging instruments to mitigate interest rate risk related to uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale and uncommitted irlcs totaled 6233 million uncommitted irlcs the duration of which are generally less than six months totaled approximately 1935 million and uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale totaled approximately 807 million at september 30 2008 at september 30 2008 we did not have any designated accounting hedges and the fair value of the hedging instruments and irlcs at september 30 2008 was an insignificant amount 

 

we also purchase forward rate agreements fras and economic interest rate hedges as part of a program to potentially offer homebuyers a below market interest rate on their home financing at september 30 2008 these potential mortgage loan originations totaled approximately 798 million and were hedged with economic interest rate hedges of 10689 million in edfc put options and 343 million in mbs put options both the fras and economic interest rate hedges have various maturities not exceeding twelve months these instruments are considered nondesignated derivatives and are accounted for at fair value with gains and losses recognized in current earnings the gains and losses for the years ended september 30 2008 and 2007 were not significant 

 

the following table sets forth principal cash flows by scheduled maturity weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value of our debt obligations as of september 30 2008 the interest rates for our variable rate debt represent the weighted average interest rates in effect at september 30 2008 because the mortgage repurchase facility is effectively secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale which are typically sold within 60 days its outstanding balance is included as a variable rate maturity in the most current period presented

 item 1 business tableend  

dr horton inc is the largest homebuilding company in the united states based on homes closed during the twelve months ended september 30 2007 we construct and sell high quality homes through our operating divisions in 27 states and 83 metropolitan markets of the united states primarily under the name of dr horton america’s builder we are a fortune 500 company and our common stock is included in the sp 500 index and listed on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol “dhi” unless the context otherwise requires the terms “dr horton” the “company” “we” and “our” used herein refer to dr horton inc a delaware corporation and its predecessors and subsidiaries 

 

donald r horton began our homebuilding business in 1978 in 1991 we were incorporated in delaware to acquire the assets and businesses of our predecessor companies which were residential home construction and development companies owned or controlled by mr horton in 1992 we completed our initial public offering of our common stock the growth of our company over the years was achieved by investing available capital into our existing homebuilding markets and into startup operations in new markets additionally we acquired numerous other homebuilding companies which strengthened our market position in existing markets and expanded our geographic presence and product offerings in other markets our homes generally range in size from 1000 to 5000 square feet and in price from 90000 to 900000 although we have maintained our position as the nation’s largest homebuilder the current downturn in our industry has resulted in a decrease in the size of our operations during fiscal 2007 as we have been affected by and have reacted to the weakened market for new homes for the year ended september 30 2007 we closed 41370 homes with an average closing sales price of approximately 259200 

 

through our financial services operations we provide mortgage banking and title agency services to homebuyers in many of our homebuilding markets dhi mortgage our whollyowned subsidiary provides mortgage financing services principally to the purchasers of the homes we build we generally do not seek to retain or service the mortgages we originate but rather seek to sell the mortgages and related servicing rights to investors our subsidiary title companies serve as title insurance agents by providing title insurance policies examination and closing services primarily to the purchasers of our homes 

 

our financial reporting segments consist of seven homebuilding segments and a financial services segment our homebuilding operations are by far the most substantial part of our business comprising approximately 98 of consolidated revenues which were 113 billion in fiscal 2007 our homebuilding operations generate most of their revenues from the sale of completed homes with a lesser amount from the sale of land and lots in addition to building traditional singlefamily detached homes we also build attached homes such as town homes duplexes triplexes and condominiums including some midrise buildings which share common walls and roofs the sale of detached homes generated approximately 81 80 and 83 of home sales revenues in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively our financial services segment generates its revenues from originating and selling mortgages and collecting fees for title insurance agency and closing services

operating strategy 

 

for the greatest part of our company’s 30year existence we maintained significant yearoveryear growth and profitability we achieved this success through an operating strategy focused on capturing greater market share while also maintaining a strong balance sheet to execute our strategy we invested available capital in our existing homebuilding markets through our capital allocation process and entered new markets as opportunities were available we also actively evaluated homebuilding acquisition opportunities as they arose some of which resulted in acquisitions and contributed to our growth 

 

during fiscal 2006 and 2007 however due to the progressive softening of demand in our homebuilding markets we have experienced declines in revenues and gross profit and we incurred a loss in fiscal 2007 although we believe the longterm fundamentals which support housing demand remain solid and the current negative conditions will moderate over time the timing of a recovery in the housing market is unclear consequently while our longterm strategy remains to continue to profitably grow our homebuilding business our primary focus while market conditions are weak is to strengthen our financial condition by reducing inventories of homes and land controlling and reducing construction and overhead costs generating positive cash flows from operations and using the cash primarily to reduce outstanding debt 

 

geographic diversity 

 

from 1978 to late 1987 our homebuilding activities were conducted in the dallasfort worth area we then began diversifying geographically by entering additional markets both through startup operations and acquisitions we now operate in 27 states and 83 markets this provides us with geographic diversification in our homebuilding inventory investments and our sources of revenues and earnings we believe our diversification strategy helps to mitigate the effects of local and regional economic cycles and enhances our longterm potential 

 

economies of scale 

 

we are the largest homebuilding company in the united states in terms of number of homes closed in fiscal 2007 by the same measure we are also either the largest or one of the five largest builders in many of our markets in fiscal 2007 we believe that our national regional and local scale of operations has provided us with benefits that may not be available in the same degree to some other smaller homebuilders such as 

 

  

decentralized operations 

 

we decentralize our homebuilding activities to give operating flexibility to our local division presidents on certain key operating decisions at september 30 2007 we had 38 separate homebuilding operating divisions some of which are in the same market area and some of which operate in more than one market area generally each operating division consists of a division president land entitlement acquisition and development personnel a sales manager and sales personnel a construction manager and construction superintendents customer service personnel a controller a purchasing manager and office staff we believe that division presidents and their management teams who are familiar with local conditions generally have better information on which to base decisions regarding local operations our division presidents receive performance bonuses based upon achieving targeted financial and operational measures in their operating divisions 

operating division responsibilities 

 

each operating division is responsible for 

 

  

— a feasibility study 

 

— soil and environmental reviews 

 

— review of existing zoning and other governmental requirements and 

 

— review of the need for and extent of offsite work required to meet local building codes 

 

  

centralized controls 

 

we centralize the key risk elements of our homebuilding business through our regional and corporate offices we have seven separate homebuilding regional offices generally each regional office consists of a region president legal counsel a chief financial officer a purchasing manager and limited office support staff each of our region presidents and their management teams are responsible for oversight of the operations of up to seven homebuilding operating divisions including 

 

  

our corporate executives and corporate office departments are responsible for establishing our operational policies and internal control standards and for monitoring compliance with established policies and controls throughout our operations the corporate office also has primary responsibility for direct management of certain key risk elements and initiatives through the following centralized functions 

 

 3 

 

  

cost management 

 

we control our overhead costs by centralizing certain administrative and accounting functions and by closely monitoring the number of administrative personnel and management positions in our operating divisions as well as in our regional and corporate offices we also minimize advertising costs by participating in promotional activities sponsored by local real estate brokers 

 

we control construction costs by striving to design our homes efficiently and by obtaining competitive bids for construction materials and labor we also negotiate favorable pricing from our primary subcontractors and suppliers based on the volume of services and products we purchase from them on a local regional and national basis we monitor our construction costs on each house through our purchasing and construction budgeting systems and we monitor our inventory levels margins returns and expenses through our management information systems 

 

acquisitions 

 

we are currently focused on strengthening our balance sheet and increasing our liquidity however we will continue to evaluate opportunities for strategic acquisitions we believe that the current housing industry downturn may provide us selected opportunities to enhance our operations through the acquisition of existing homebuilding companies at attractive valuations in certain instances such acquisitions can provide us benefits not found in startup operations such as established land positions and inventories and existing relationships with municipalities land owners developers subcontractors and suppliers we seek to limit the risks associated with acquiring other companies by conducting extensive operational financial and legal due diligence on each acquisition and by only acquiring homebuilding companies that we believe will have a positive impact on our earnings within an acceptable period of time 

markets 

 

we conduct our homebuilding operations in all of the geographic regions states and markets listed below and we conduct our mortgage and title operations in many of these markets our homebuilding operating segments are our homebuilding reportable regions and are comprised of the following markets 

 

 

 

 

when evaluating new or existing homebuilding markets for purposes of capital allocation we consider the following local marketspecific factors among others 

 

  

land policies 

 

typically we acquire land after we have completed appropriate due diligence and generally after we have obtained the rights “entitlements” to begin development or construction work resulting in an acceptable number of residential lots before we acquire lots or tracts of land we will among other things complete a feasibility study which includes soil tests independent environmental studies and other engineering work and evaluate the status of necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements required to develop and use the property for home construction although we purchase and develop land primarily to support our homebuilding activities we also sell lots and land to other developers and homebuilders 

 

we also enter into landlot option contracts in which we obtain the right but generally not the obligation to buy land or lots at predetermined prices on a defined schedule commensurate with anticipated home closings or planned land development our option contracts generally are nonrecourse which limits our financial exposure to our earnest money deposited with land and lot sellers and any preacquisition due diligence costs incurred by us this enables us to control significant land and lot positions with limited capital investment which substantially reduces the risks associated with land ownership and development 

 

almost all of our land positions are acquired directly by us we avoid entering into joint venture arrangements due to their increased costs and complexity as well as the loss of operational control inherent in such arrangements we are a party to a very small number of joint ventures that were acquired through acquisitions of other homebuilders all of these joint ventures are consolidated in our financial statements 

 

we attempt to mitigate our exposure to real estate inventory risks by

construction 

 

our home designs are selected or prepared in each of our markets to appeal to local tastes and preferences of homebuyers in each community we also offer optional interior and exterior features to allow homebuyers to enhance the basic home design and to allow us to generate additional revenues from each home sold 

 

substantially all of our construction work is performed by subcontractors subcontractors typically are retained for a specific subdivision pursuant to a contract that obligates the subcontractor to complete construction at an agreedupon price agreements with the subcontractors and suppliers we use generally are negotiated for each subdivision we compete with other homebuilders for qualified subcontractors raw materials and lots in the markets where we operate we employ construction superintendents to monitor homes under construction participate in major design and building decisions coordinate the activities of subcontractors and suppliers review the work of subcontractors for quality and cost controls and monitor compliance with zoning and building codes in addition our construction superintendents play a significant role in working with our homebuyers by assisting with option selection and home modification decisions educating buyers on the construction process and instructing buyers on postclosing home maintenance 

 

construction time for our homes depends on the weather availability of labor materials and supplies size of the home and other factors we typically complete the construction of a home within four to six months 

 

we typically do not maintain significant inventories of construction materials except for work in progress materials for homes under construction generally the construction materials used in our operations are readily available from numerous sources we have contracts exceeding one year with certain suppliers of our building materials that are cancelable at our option with a 30 day notice in recent years we have not experienced delays in construction due to shortages of materials or labor that have materially affected our consolidated operating results 

 

marketing and sales 

 

we market and sell our homes through commissioned employees and independent real estate brokers we typically conduct home sales from sales offices located in furnished model homes in each subdivision and we typically do not offer our model homes for sale until the completion of a subdivision our sales personnel assist prospective homebuyers by providing them with floor plans price information tours of model homes and assisting them with the selection of options and other custom features we train and inform our sales personnel as to the availability of financing construction schedules and marketing and advertising plans as market conditions warrant we may provide potential homebuyers with one or more of a variety of incentives including discounts and free upgrades to be competitive in a particular market in the current weak market conditions we have significantly increased the level of incentives we are offering to homebuyers in most markets 

 

we advertise in our local markets as necessary through newspapers marketing brochures and newsletters we also use billboards radio and television advertising and our internet website to market the location price range and availability of our homes to minimize advertising costs we attempt to operate in subdivisions in conspicuous locations that permit us to take advantage of local traffic patterns we also believe that model homes play a substantial role in our marketing efforts so we expend significant effort to create an attractive atmosphere in our model homes 

 

in addition to using model homes in certain markets we build a limited number of speculative homes in each subdivision these homes enhance our marketing and sales efforts to prospective homebuyers who are relocating to these markets as well as to independent brokers who often represent homebuyers requiring a completed home within 60 days we determine our speculative homes strategy in each market based on local market factors such as new job growth the number of job relocations housing demand seasonality current sales contract cancellation trends and our past experience in the market we determine the number of speculative homes to build in each subdivision based on our then current and planned sales pace and we 

monitor and adjust speculative homes inventory on an ongoing basis as conditions warrant we typically have sold a substantial majority of our speculative homes while they are under construction or soon after completion however the softness in our housing markets and related high cancellation rates during fiscal 2006 and 2007 have caused our speculative homes inventory to remain higher than our target levels while we plan to reduce both total and speculative homes in inventory from current levels we do expect to maintain a level of speculative home inventory in our markets to be in line with our expectations of future sales and closings volume we believe these speculative homes help to provide us with opportunities to sell additional homes reduce our inventory and generate positive cash flows 

 

our sales contracts require an earnest money deposit of at least 500 the amount of earnest money required varies between markets and subdivisions and may significantly exceed 500 additionally customers are generally required to pay additional deposits when they select options or upgrade features for their homes most of our sales contracts stipulate that when customers cancel their contracts with us we have the right to retain their earnest money and option deposits however our operating divisions occasionally choose to refund such deposits our sales contracts also include a financing contingency which permits customers to cancel and receive a refund of their deposits if they cannot obtain mortgage financing at prevailing or specified interest rates within a specified period our contracts may include other contingencies such as the sale of an existing home as a percentage of gross sales orders cancellations of sales contracts in fiscal 2007 were 38 and our cancellation rate in the fourth quarter was 48 these cancellation rates are significantly higher than our typical historical rate of approximately 20 reflecting the current weak housing market conditions the length of time between the signing of a sales contract for a home and delivery of the home to the buyer closing averages from two to six months 

 

customer service and quality control 

 

our operating divisions are responsible for preclosing quality control inspections and responding to customers’ postclosing needs we believe that prompt and courteous response to homebuyers’ needs during and after construction reduces postclosing repair costs enhances our reputation for quality and service and ultimately leads to significant repeat and referral business from the real estate community and homebuyers we provide our homebuyers with a limited oneyear warranty on workmanship and building materials the subcontractors who perform the actual construction also provide us with warranties on workmanship and are generally prepared to respond to us and the homeowner promptly upon request in addition we typically provide a supplemental tenyear limited warranty that covers major construction defects and some of our suppliers provide manufacturer’s warranties on specified products installed in the home 

 

customer mortgage financing 

 

we provide mortgage financing services principally to purchasers of our homes in the majority of our homebuilding markets through our whollyowned subsidiary dhi mortgage dhi mortgage coordinates and expedites the entire sales transaction by ensuring that mortgage commitments are received and that closings take place in a timely and efficient manner dhi mortgage originates mortgage loans for a substantial portion of our homebuyers and when necessary to fulfill the needs of some homebuyers also brokers loans to thirdparty lenders who directly originate the mortgage loans during the year ended september 30 2007 approximately 95 of dhi mortgage’s loan volume related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations and dhi mortgage provided mortgage financing services for approximately 66 of our total homes closed 

 

to limit the risks associated with our mortgage operations dhi mortgage only originates loan products that it believes may be sold to thirdparty investors dhi mortgage does not seek to service the loans it originates but rather packages and sells the loans and their servicing rights to thirdparty investors shortly after origination on a limited recourse basis generally limited to early payment defaults or fraud and misrepresentation in markets where we currently do not provide mortgage financing we work with a variety of mortgage lenders that make available to homebuyers a range of mortgage financing programs 

title services 

 

through our subsidiary title companies we serve as a title insurance agent in selected markets by providing title insurance policies examination and closing services to purchasers of homes we build and sell we currently assume little or no underwriting risk associated with these title policies 

 

employees 

 

at september 30 2007 we employed 6231 persons of whom 1229 were sales and marketing personnel 2031 were executive administrative and clerical personnel 1869 were involved in construction and 1102 worked in mortgage and title operations we had fewer than 20 employees covered by collective bargaining agreements employees of some of the subcontractors which we use are represented by labor unions or are subject to collective bargaining agreements we believe that our relations with our employees and subcontractors are good 

 

competition 

 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive we compete in each of our markets with numerous other national regional and local homebuilders for homebuyers desirable properties raw materials skilled labor and financing we also compete with resales of existing homes and with the rental housing market our homes compete on the basis of quality price design mortgage financing terms and location in the current soft housing conditions competition among homebuilders has greatly intensified especially as to pricing and incentives as builders attempt to maximize sales volume despite the slowdown in housing demand our financial services business competes with other mortgage lenders including national regional and local mortgage bankers and other financial institutions some of which have greater access to capital markets different lending criteria and potentially broader product offerings 

 

governmental regulation and environmental matters 

 

the homebuilding industry is subject to extensive and complex regulations we and the subcontractors we use must comply with various federal state and local laws and regulations including zoning density and development requirements building environmental advertising and real estate sales rules and regulations these requirements affect the development process as well as building materials to be used building designs and minimum elevation of properties our homes are inspected by local authorities where required and homes eligible for insurance or guarantees provided by the fha and va are subject to inspection by them these regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities in addition our new housing developments may be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets and other public improvements 

 

our homebuilding operations are also subject to a variety of local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning protection of health safety and the environment the particular environmental laws for each site vary greatly according to location environmental condition and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties 

 

our mortgage company and title insurance agencies must also comply with various federal and state laws and regulations these include eligibility and other requirements for participation in the programs offered by the fha va gnma fannie mae and freddie mac these also include required compliance with consumer lending and other laws and regulations such as disclosure requirements prohibitions against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures all of these laws and regulations may subject our operations to examination by the applicable agencies 

 

seasonality 

 

we have typically experienced seasonal variations in our quarterly operating results and capital requirements in prior years we generally had more homes under construction closed more homes and had greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year this seasonal activity 

increased our working capital requirements for our homebuilding operations during the third and fourth fiscal quarters and increased our funding requirements for the mortgages we originated in our financial services segment at the end of these quarters as a result of seasonal activity our results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year 

 

in contrast to our typical seasonal results due to further deterioration of homebuilding market conditions during fiscal 2007 we incurred consolidated operating losses in our third and fourth fiscal quarters these results were primarily due to recording significant inventory and goodwill impairment charges also the increasingly challenging market conditions caused further weakening in sales volume pricing and margins as the fiscal year progressed although we may experience our typical historical seasonal pattern in the future given the current market conditions we can make no assurances as to when or whether this pattern will recur

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

discussion of our business and operations included in this annual report on form 10k should be read together with the risk factors set forth below they describe various risks and uncertainties to which we are or may become subject these risks and uncertainties together with other factors described elsewhere in this report have the potential to affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner 

 

the homebuilding industry is undergoing a significant downturn and its duration and ultimate severity are uncertain further deterioration in industry conditions or in the broader economic conditions of the markets where we operate could further decrease demand and pricing for new homes and have additional adverse effects on our operations and financial results 

 

the homebuilding industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in industry conditions as well as in general and local economic conditions such as 

 

  

these may occur on a national scale or may affect some of the regions or markets in which we operate more than others when adverse conditions affect any of our larger markets they have a proportionately greater impact on us than on some other homebuilding companies our operations in previously strong markets particularly california florida and nevada where we have significant inventory have more adversely affected our financial results than our other markets in the current downturn 

 

an oversupply of alternatives to new homes such as existing homes including homes held for sale by investors and speculators foreclosed homes and rental properties can also reduce our ability to sell new homes and depress new home prices and reduce our margins on the sales of new homes 

 

during fiscal 2007 the already difficult conditions within the industry became progressively more challenging as demand for new homes continued to decline in most of our markets the slowing demand combined with the continued elevation in our sales cancellation rate caused our sales results to be significantly below expectations also our gross profit from home sales revenues continued to decline as we offered higher levels of incentives and price concessions in attempts to stimulate demand in our communities 

we believe that housing market conditions will continue to be challenging and may deteriorate further we cannot predict the duration or ultimate severity of these challenging conditions 

 

the reduction in availability of mortgage financing and the volatility and reduction in liquidity in the financial markets have adversely affected our business and the duration and ultimate severity of the effects are uncertain 

 

during fiscal 2007 the mortgage lending industry experienced significant instability due to among other things defaults on subprime loans and a resulting decline in the market value of such loans in light of these developments lenders investors regulators and other third parties questioned the adequacy of lending standards and other credit requirements for several loan programs made available to borrowers in recent years this has led to reduced investor demand for mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities tightened credit requirements reduced liquidity and increased credit risk premiums a deterioration in credit quality among subprime and other nonconforming loans has caused almost all lenders to eliminate subprime mortgages and most other loan products that are not conforming loans fhavaeligible loans or jumbo loans which meet conforming underwriting guidelines other than loan size fewer loan products and tighter loan qualifications in turn make it more difficult for some borrowers to finance the purchase of our homes and for some buyers of existing homes from our moveup buyers to finance the purchase of the moveup buyer’s existing home these factors have served to reduce the pool of qualified homebuyers and made it more difficult to sell to first time and first time moveup buyers which have long made up a substantial part of our customers these reductions in demand have adversely affected our operations and financial results and the duration and severity of the effects are uncertain 

 

we believe that the liquidity provided by fannie mae and freddie mac to the mortgage industry is very important to the housing market these entities have recently reported losses as a result of deteriorating housing and credit market conditions these losses have reduced their equity which may limit their ability to acquire mortgages the federal government recently sought to limit the size of the homeloan portfolios and operations of these governmentsponsored enterprises any limitations or restrictions on the availability of the financing or on the liquidity provided by them could adversely affect interest rates mortgage availability and our sales of new homes and mortgage loans 

 

our strategies in responding to the adverse conditions in the homebuilding industry have had limited success and the continued implementation of these and other strategies may not be successful 

 

while we have been successful in generating positive operating cash flow and reducing our inventories in fiscal 2007 we have done so at significantly reduced gross profit levels and have incurred significant asset impairment charges these have contributed to the net loss we recognized in fiscal 2007 also in fiscal 2007 notwithstanding our sales strategies we continued to experience an elevated rate of sales contract cancellations we believe that the increase in the cancellation rate is largely due to a decrease in homebuyer confidence due principally to continued price declines and increases in the level of sales incentives for both new and existing homes a more restrictive mortgage lending environment and the inability of some buyers to sell their existing homes have also impacted cancellations many of the factors that affect new sales and cancellation rates are beyond our control it is uncertain how long the reduction in sales and the increased level of cancellations will continue 

 

the homebuilding industry continues to be cyclical and affected by changes in general economic real estate or other business conditions that could adversely affect our business or financial results 

 

inventory risks inventory risks are substantial for our homebuilding business the risks inherent in controlling or purchasing and developing land increase as consumer demand for housing decreases thus we may have acquired options on or bought and developed land at a cost we will not be able to recover fully or on which we cannot build and sell homes profitably our deposits for building lots controlled under option or similar contracts may be put at risk the value of undeveloped land building lots and housing inventories can also fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions in addition inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in reduced margins or losses in a poorly performing project or market in the 

present weak market conditions we have sold homes and land for lower profit margins than in the past and we have recorded significant inventory impairment charges 

 

historically our goals for years of supply for ownership and control of land and building lots were based on management’s expectations for future volume growth in light of the much weaker market conditions encountered in fiscal 2006 which further deteriorated in fiscal 2007 our expectations changed and we significantly slowed our purchases of land and lots as part of our strategy to reduce our inventory to better match our reduced rate of production we terminated numerous land option contracts and wrote off earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs related to these option contracts we cannot make any assurances that the measures we employ to manage inventory risks and costs will be successful 

 

supply risks the homebuilding industry has from time to time experienced significant difficulties that can affect the cost or timing of construction including 

 

  

risks from nature weather conditions and natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes wildfires volcanic activity droughts and floods can harm our homebuilding business these can delay home closings adversely affect the cost or availability of materials or labor or damage homes under construction the climates and geology of many of the states in which we operate including california florida and texas where we have some of our larger operations present increased risks of adverse weather or natural disaster 

 

risks related to national security continued military deployments in the middle east and other overseas regions terrorist attacks other acts of violence or threats to national security and any corresponding response by the united states or others or related domestic or international instability may adversely affect general economic conditions or cause a slowdown of the national economy 

 

consequences as a result of the foregoing matters potential customers may be less able or willing to buy our homes or we may take longer or incur more costs to build them because of current market conditions we have not been able to recapture any increased costs by raising prices in the future our ability to do so may also be limited by market conditions or because we fix our prices in advance of delivery by signing home sales contracts we may be unable to change the mix of our home offerings or the affordability of our homes to maintain our margins or satisfactorily address changing market conditions in other ways in addition cancellations of home sales contracts in backlog may increase as homebuyers cancel or do not honor their contracts 

 

our financial services business is closely related to our homebuilding business as it originates mortgage loans principally to purchasers of the homes we build a decrease in the demand for our homes because of the foregoing matters may also adversely affect the financial results of this segment of our business an increase in the default rate on the mortgages we originate may adversely affect our ability to sell the mortgages or the pricing we receive upon the sale of mortgages or may increase our repurchase obligations for previous originations 

increases in interest rates reductions in mortgage availability or increases in other costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business or our financial results during fiscal 2007 we experienced a reduction in the mortgage financing available to our customers 

 

most of our customers finance their home purchases through lenders providing mortgage financing prior to the recent volatility in the financial markets interest rates were at historical lows and a variety of mortgage products were available as a result homeownership became more accessible the mortgage products available included features that allowed buyers to obtain financing for a significant portion up to all of the purchase price of the home had very limited underwriting requirements or provided for lower initial monthly payments as a result more people were able to qualify for mortgage financing during fiscal 2007 there was a significant decrease in the type of mortgage products available and a general increase in the qualification requirements for mortgages such that fewer people are able to qualify for and obtain mortgage financing this coupled with higher mortgage interest rates has reduced demand for new homes 

 

some of our homebuyers use down payment assistance programs which allow homebuyers to receive gift funds from nonprofit corporations to be used as a down payment homebuilders are a source of funding for these programs the department of housing and urban development hud and congress are considering limitations and further regulation of these programs new restrictions may limit the ability of sellerfunded nonprofit corporations to fund down payment assistance programs for governmentinsured mortgage loans hud has issued a rule that eliminates sellerfunded down payment assistance as an acceptable minimum investment in the property for fha insured loans however the implementation of that rule has been delayed as a result of litigation filed by certain down payment assistance providers the ultimate outcome of this litigation is uncertain if as a result of legislative regulatory or other action the gift fund programs that some of our customers use would no longer be available to them we would expect to seek other financing alternatives and seek different down payment programs for those customers who meet applicable guidelines there can be no assurance however that any such alternative programs would be as attractive to our customers as the programs offered today and that our sales would not suffer 

 

we believe that the availability of fha and va mortgage financing is an important factor in marketing some of our homes any limitations or restrictions on the availability of the financing provided by them could adversely affect interest rates mortgage financing and our sales of new homes and mortgage loans 

 

even if potential customers do not need financing changes in interest rates and the availability of mortgage financing products may make it harder for them to sell their current homes to potential buyers who need financing 

 

significant expenses of owning a home including mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes generally are deductible expenses for an individual’s federal and in some cases state income taxes subject to various limitations under current tax law and policy if the federal government or a state government changes its income tax laws as has been discussed to eliminate or substantially modify these income tax deductions the aftertax cost of owning a new home could increase for many of our potential customers the resulting loss or reduction of homeowner tax deductions if such tax law changes were enacted without offsetting provisions could adversely impact demand for and sales prices of new homes 

 

these matters may adversely affect the sales or pricing of our homes and may also reduce the volume or margins in our financial services business the impact on our financial services business may be compounded to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate through the various hedging strategies we employ 

 

governmental regulations could increase the cost and limit the availability of our development and homebuilding projects or affect our related financial services operations and adversely affect our business or financial results 

 

we are subject to extensive and complex regulations that affect land development and home construction including zoning density restrictions building design and building standards these regulations often provide 

broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities as to the conditions we must meet prior to being approved if approved at all we are subject to determinations by these authorities as to the adequacy of water or sewage facilities roads or other local services in addition in many markets government authorities have implemented no growth or growth control initiatives any of these can limit delay or increase the costs of development or home construction 

 

new housing developments may be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets and other public improvements which could cause an increase in the total cost of homeownership in addition increases in property tax rates by local governmental authorities as experienced in response to reduced federal and state funding can adversely affect the ability of potential customers to obtain financing or their desire to purchase new homes 

 

we are subject to a variety of local state and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of health safety and the environment the impact of environmental laws varies depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available these matters may result in delays may cause us to incur substantial compliance remediation mitigation and other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas 

 

our financial services operations are also subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations these include eligibility requirements for participation in federal loan programs compliance with consumer lending and similar requirements such as disclosure requirements prohibitions against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures they may also subject our operations to examination by the applicable agencies these factors may limit our ability to provide mortgage financing or title services to potential purchasers of our homes 

 

our substantial debt could adversely affect our financial condition 

 

we have a significant amount of debt as of september 30 2007 our consolidated debt was 43768 million in the ordinary course of business we may incur significant additional debt to the extent permitted by our revolving credit facility our indentures and the credit facilities of our financial services subsidiaries 

 

possible consequences the amount of our debt could have important consequences for example it could 

 

  

dependence on future performance our ability to meet our debt service and other obligations will depend upon our future financial performance we are engaged in businesses that are substantially affected by changes in industry and economic conditions our revenues and earnings vary with the level of general economic activity in the markets we serve our businesses are also affected by financial political business and other factors many of which are beyond our control the factors that affect our ability to generate cash can also affect our ability to raise additional funds for these purposes through the sale of debt or equity securities the refinancing of debt or the sale of assets changes in prevailing interest rates may affect our ability to meet our debt service obligations because borrowings under our credit facilities bear interest at floating rates and our interest rate swap agreements fix our interest rate for only a portion of these borrowings 

 

as of september 30 2007 the scheduled maturities of principal on our outstanding debt for the subsequent 12 months totaled 6312 million including 3878 million in financial services debt that must be renewed annually based on the current level of operations we believe our cash flow from operations available cash 

available borrowings under our credit facilities and our ability to access the capital markets and to refinance or renew our facilities in a timely manner will be adequate to meet our future cash needs we cannot however make any assurances that in the future our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that borrowings or access to the capital markets or refinancing or renewal facilities will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay or refinance our indebtedness or to fund other cash needs 

 

indenture and credit facility restrictions our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes impose restrictions on our operations and activities the most significant restrictions relate to limits on investments cash dividends stock repurchases and other restricted payments incurrence of indebtedness creation of liens and asset dispositions and require maintenance of a maximum leverage ratio a minimum ratio of earnings before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization to interest incurred minimum levels of tangible net worth and compliance with other financial covenants in addition the indentures governing our senior notes impose restrictions on the creation of liens if we fail to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants the trustees the noteholders or the lending banks as applicable could cause our debt to become due and payable prior to maturity in addition if the margins by which we meet the financial covenants in our revolving credit facility are reduced significantly in the future we or our lenders may seek to negotiate revised terms for the facility that could increase the cost reduce the availability or change other conditions of the facility 

 

the credit facilities of our financial services subsidiaries also require the maintenance of minimum levels of tangible net worth ratio of debt to tangible net worth and net income a failure to comply with these requirements could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds to the financial services subsidiaries or cause their debt to become due and payable prior to maturity 

 

change in debt rating until november 2007 we had investment grade ratings on our senior debt from all three of the major rating agencies in november one of the agencies lowered our rating below investment grade while another placed us on watch for a possible downgrade from investment grade the third agency has a negative outlook on its investment grade rating of our debt if we do not maintain our investment grade credit ratings from both of the remaining agencies available credit under our revolving credit facility is subject to limitations based on specified percentages of unsold homes developed lots and lots under development included in inventory and the amount of other senior unsecured indebtedness and the cost of such capital may increase further the loss of our investment grade rating can make accessing the public debt markets more difficult and expensive 

 

change of control purchase options if a change of control occurs as defined in the indentures governing many series of our senior and senior subordinated notes constituting 19 billion principal amount in the aggregate as of september 30 2007 we would be required to offer to purchase such notes at 101 of their principal amount together with all accrued and unpaid interest if any moreover a change of control may also result in the acceleration of our revolving credit facility and our financial services credit facilities if purchase offers were required under the indentures for these notes or these credit facilities were accelerated we can give no assurance that we would have sufficient funds to pay the amounts that we would be required to purchase or repay at september 30 2007 we did not have sufficient funds available to purchase or pay all of such outstanding debt upon a change of control 

 

impact of financial services debt our financial services business is conducted through subsidiaries that are not restricted by our indentures or revolving credit facility the ability of our financial services subsidiaries to provide funds to our homebuilding operations however is subject to restrictions in their own credit facilities these funds would not be available to us upon the occurrence and during the continuance of defaults under these facilities moreover our right to receive assets from these subsidiaries upon liquidation or recapitalization will be subject to the prior claims of the creditors of these subsidiaries any claims we may have to funds from this segment would be subordinate to subsidiary indebtedness to the extent of any security for such indebtedness and to any indebtedness otherwise recognized as senior to our claims 

homebuilding and financial services are very competitive and competitive conditions could adversely affect our business or our financial results 

 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive homebuilders compete not only for homebuyers but also for desirable properties financing raw materials and skilled labor we compete with other local regional and national homebuilders often within larger subdivisions designed planned and developed by such homebuilders we also compete with existing home sales and rental properties the competitive conditions in the homebuilding industry can result in 

 

  

our financial services business competes with other mortgage lenders including national regional and local mortgage banks and other financial institutions mortgage lenders with greater access to capital markets or different lending criteria may be able to offer more attractive financing to potential customers 

 

when we are affected by these competitive conditions our business and financial results could be adversely affected in the current downturn in the homebuilding industry the reactions of our competitors may have reduced the effectiveness of our efforts to achieve pricing stability and reduce our inventory levels 

 

our future operations may require additional capital which may not be available 

 

our operations require significant amounts of cash we may be required to seek additional capital whether from sales of equity debt issuances or additional bank borrowings for our business we can give no assurance as to the availability of such additional capital or if available whether it would be on terms acceptable to us moreover the indentures for our outstanding public debt and the covenants of our credit facilities contain provisions that may restrict the debt we may incur in the future if we are not successful in obtaining sufficient capital it could reduce the level of our business and may adversely affect our financial results 

 

we cannot make any assurances that any future growth strategies will be successful 

 

since 1993 we acquired many homebuilding companies although we focused on internal growth in recent years we may make strategic acquisitions of homebuilding companies in the future successful strategic acquisitions require the integration of operations and management and other efforts to realize the benefits that may be available although we believe that we have been successful in doing so in the past we can give no assurance that we would be able to identify acquire and integrate successfully strategic acquisitions in the future acquisitions can result in the dilution of existing stockholders if we issue our common stock as consideration or reduce our liquidity or increase our debt if we fund them with cash in addition acquisitions can expose us to valuation risks including the risk of writing off goodwill related to such acquisitions based on the subsequent results of the operating segments to which the acquired businesses were assigned the risk of writeoffs related to goodwill impairment increases during a cyclical housing downturn when profitability of our operating segments may decline as evidenced by the goodwill impairment charges we recognized in fiscal 2007 moreover we may not be able to implement successfully our operating and future growth strategies within our existing markets 

homebuilding is subject to home warranty and construction defect claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant 

 

as a homebuilder we are subject to home warranty and construction defect claims arising in the ordinary course of business as a consequence we maintain product liability insurance obtain indemnities and certificates of insurance from subcontractors generally covering claims related to workmanship and materials and create warranty and other reserves for the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built because of the uncertainties inherent to these matters we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will be adequate to address all of our warranty and construction defect claims in the future contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce we may be responsible for applicable selfinsured retentions and some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits additionally the coverage offered by and the availability of product liability insurance for construction defects are currently limited and costly we have responded to increases in insurance costs and coverage limitations in recent years by increasing our selfinsured retentions and claim reserves there can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted or become more costly

results of operations — fiscal year 2007 overview 

 

our fiscal 2007 results reflect the challenges that the homebuilding industry faced during the year fiscal 2006 marked the beginning of the current housing downturn and in fiscal 2007 the factors hurting demand for new homes persisted grew in intensity and became more pervasive across the united states throughout the year the already difficult conditions within the industry became progressively more challenging high inventory levels of both new and existing homes elevated cancellation rates low sales absorption rates affordability issues and overall weak consumer confidence persisted through the year the effects of these factors were further magnified by a decline in availability of mortgage products and higher mortgage interest rates on certain loan products due to credit tightening in the mortgage markets these factors combined with our continued elevated sales cancellation rate caused our sales volume to be significantly below expectations also our gross profit from home sales revenues continued to decline as we offered higher levels of incentives and price concessions in attempts to stimulate demand in our communities 

 

as we progressed though fiscal 2007 our disappointing sales results further declines in our sales order prices continued declines in our gross profit from home sales revenues and the more challenging market conditions caused us to have a more cautious outlook for the homebuilding industry and its impact on our business we believe that housing market conditions will continue to be challenging and may deteriorate further and that the timing of a recovery in the housing market remains unclear our outlook incorporates several factors including continued margin pressure from increased price reductions and sales incentives continued high levels of new and existing homes available for sale weak demand from new home consumers as they continue to see home prices adjust downward continued high sales cancellations continued weak housing affordability in many markets that experienced rapid price appreciation over the past few years and permanent restrictions on the availability of certain mortgage products as a result of the recent credit tightening in the mortgage markets 

 

due to the declining market conditions and our increased use of price reductions and sales incentives we evaluated a significant portion of our inventory in our quarterly impairment analyses during fiscal 2007 additionally we evaluated the recoverability of our goodwill our goodwill and inventory impairment evaluations reflected our expectation of continued and increasing challenges in the homebuilding industry and our belief that these challenging conditions may last longer and have a greater impact on our business than we previously believed based on our evaluations we recorded significant impairment charges to our inventory and goodwill balances during the year which resulted in a net loss for fiscal 2007 

 

strategy 

 

we believe the longterm fundamentals which support housing demand namely population growth and household formation remain solid we also believe the current negative market conditions the effects of which have been more severe and more prolonged than previously expected will moderate over the long term in the interim we remain committed to the following initiatives related to our operating strategy in the current homebuilding business environment 

 

  

  

 21 

 

  

these initiatives allowed us to generate significant cash flows from operations during fiscal 2007 which we utilized to reduce our outstanding debt by a substantial amount although we cannot provide any assurances that these initiatives will continue to be successful we expect that our operating strategy will allow us to continue to strengthen our balance sheet and liquidity position

results of operations — homebuilding 

 

our operating segments are our seven homebuilding operating regions which we present as separate reportable segments previously we presented six homebuilding reporting segments aggregating both our northeast and midwest operating regions into our northeast reporting segment however because of a realignment of our management structure during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 our colorado markets are now included in our midwest operating region rather than in our southwest operating region as a result we determined that each of our seven operating regions constitutes a reportable segment as reflected in our current year presentation all prior year segment information has been restated to conform to the fiscal 2007 presentation these reporting segments which we also refer to as reporting regions have homebuilding operations located in the following states

homebuilding operating margin analysis 

 

 

 

net sales orders and backlog 

 

net sales orders represent the number and dollar value of new sales contracts executed with customers net of sales contract cancellations the value of net sales orders decreased 41 to 82306 million 33687 homes in 2007 from 138952 million 51980 homes in 2006 the value of net sales orders decreased 48 to 13095 million 6374 homes in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 from 25322 million 10430 homes in the same period of fiscal 2006 the decreases in our net sales orders reflect the softening of demand for new homes in most homebuilding markets we believe the most significant factors contributing to the slowing of demand for new homes in most of our markets include an increase in the supply of existing homes for sale a reduction in investor purchases a decrease in the availability of mortgage financing for many potential homebuyers and a decline in homebuyer consumer confidence additionally we believe that the rapid price appreciation of new and existing homes in many markets over the past several years has reduced the number of potential homebuyers able to afford a home many prospective homebuyers continue to approach the purchase decision more tentatively due to continued increases in price concessions and sales incentives offered on both new and existing homes concern over their ability to sell an existing home or obtain mortgage financing and the general uncertainty surrounding the housing market we have attempted to increase sales by providing increased sales incentives and lowering prices but the factors above combined with the continued pricing responses of our competitors have limited the impact of our pricing efforts subsequent to fiscal year 2007 the volume of our net sales orders for the month ended october 31 2007 decreased 54 compared to the month ended october 31 2006 

 

in comparing fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2006 the value of net sales orders decreased significantly in all seven of our market regions these decreases were primarily due to similar decreases in the number of homes sold in each region although in our southeast southwest and california regions a decline in average selling prices was also a significant factor the decreases in average selling prices were primarily due to the increased use of price concessions and sales incentives and to a lesser extent a shift to more affordable products in those regions 

 

the most significant decline in net sales orders in fiscal 2007 occurred in our california region with 48 fewer homes sold than in fiscal 2006 we believe that home sales in our california markets have been negatively impacted to a greater extent than our other regions by a reduction in the pool of qualified buyers due to a lack of housing affordability and the decline of mortgage availability we are closely monitoring on a project by project basis our products pricing and other operational strategies in the california region we will further modify product offerings and pricing as necessary as we attempt to improve our sales in this region 

 

our annual cancellation rate sales orders cancelled divided by gross sales orders was 38 in fiscal 2007 compared to 28 in fiscal 2006 our cancellation rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 was 48 and 

cancellations in the month ended october 31 2007 were at a similar rate the higher overall cancellation rate for fiscal 2007 was primarily attributable to cancellations in many of our arizona california and florida markets these elevated cancellation rates reflect the ongoing challenges in most homebuilding markets including the inability of many prospective homebuyers to sell their existing homes the increasing level of sales incentives and home price reductions in our markets continuing to erode buyer confidence and further credit tightening in the mortgage markets the impact of the credit tightening became apparent in our cancellation rates in late august and continued through september and october as the mortgage products many buyers had selected were no longer available or they could not qualify due to stricter underwriting guidelines 

 

the average price of our net sales orders in fiscal 2007 was 244300 a decrease of 9 from the 267300 average in fiscal 2006 the average price of our net sales orders decreased significantly in our southeast southwest and california regions due primarily to price reductions and increased incentives in our florida arizona and california markets in general our pricing is dependent on the demand for our homes and declines in our average selling prices during the year were due in large part to increases in the use of price reductions and sales incentives further as the inventory of existing homes for sale has continued to rise it has led to the need to ensure our pricing is competitive with comparable existing home sales prices we continually monitor and may adjust our product mix geographic mix and pricing within our homebuilding markets in an effort to keep our core product offerings affordable for our target customer base typically firsttime and moveup homebuyers to a lesser extent than the competitive factors discussed above this has also contributed to decreases in the average selling price 

 

sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies including mortgage loan approval and buyers selling their existing homes which can result in cancellations before the current housing downturn our backlog has been a reliable indicator of the level of home closings in our two subsequent fiscal quarters however due to our current elevated cancellation rates higher level of unsold homes in inventory and difficult conditions in many of our markets this relationship between backlog and future home closings may have changed 

 

at september 30 2007 the value of our backlog of sales orders was 26944 million 10442 homes a decrease of 48 from 51851 million 18125 homes at september 30 2006 the average sales price of homes in backlog was 258000 at september 30 2007 down 10 from the 286100 average at september 30 2006 the value of our sales order backlog decreased significantly in all of our market regions with the largest percentage decrease occurring in our california region 

 

home sales revenue and gross profit 

 

revenues from home sales decreased 26 to 107212 million 41370 homes closed in 2007 from 145454 million 53099 homes closed in 2006 revenues from home sales decreased in all seven of our market regions led by the midwest and california regions with decreases of 41 and 40 respectively the average selling price of homes closed during 2007 was 259200 down 5 from 273900 in 2006 the decrease in our fiscal 2007 home sales revenues was the result of slowing demand and the resulting decline in net sales order volume and pricing during the year 

 

the number of homes closed in 2007 decreased 22 due to decreases in six of our seven market regions as a result of the decline in net sales orders during the year and the decline in our sales order backlog we expect to close fewer homes in fiscal 2008 than we did in fiscal 2007 as conditions change in the housing markets in which we operate our ongoing level of net sales orders will determine the number of home closings and amount of revenue we will generate 

 

revenues from home sales in fiscal 2007 and 2006 were increased by 580 million and 16 million respectively from changes in profit deferred pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 66 “accounting for sales of real estate” the home sales profit related to our mortgage loans held for sale is deferred in instances where a buyer finances a home through our whollyowned mortgage company and has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment as prescribed by sfas no 66 as of september 30 

2007 the balance of deferred profit related to such mortgage loans held for sale was 326 million compared to 906 million at september 30 2006 the decline is attributable to both the drop in the number of homes closed and a decline in the availability of the mortgage types whose use generally resulted in the sfas no 66 profit deferral 

 

total homebuilding gross profit decreased by 82 to 6037 million in 2007 from 33422 million in 2006 including sales of both homes and landlots as well as impairment charges and land option cost writeoffs total homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding revenues decreased 1720 basis points to 54 in 2007 from 226 in 2006 approximately 1020 basis points of the decrease was due to the effect of inventory impairment charges and land option cost writeoffs as a percentage of homebuilding revenues these were 120 in fiscal 2007 versus 18 in fiscal 2006 

 

gross profit from home sales decreased by 47 to 18489 million in 2007 from 34976 million in 2006 and as a percentage of home sales revenues decreased 680 basis points to 172 the primary factor reducing our home sales gross profit margin was the difficult market conditions discussed above which narrowed the range between our selling prices and costs of our homes in most of our markets causing a decline of approximately 650 basis points in home sales gross profit as a percentage of home sales revenues due to the current sales environment in many of our markets we have offered a variety of incentives and price concessions which affect our gross profit margin by reducing the selling price of the home or increasing the cost of the home without a proportional increase in the selling price we are also offering greater discounts and incentives to sell our inventory of homes which is at a higher than desired level this strategy has helped reduce our total homes in inventory by approximately 8600 units from september 30 2006 but has also contributed to a decline in our home sales gross profit additionally our home sales gross margin decreased approximately 60 basis points due to an increase in the amortization of capitalized interest and 30 basis points due to an increase in warranty and construction defect expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues these decreases were partially offset by improvements in home sales gross margin of 20 basis points due primarily to an increase in the relative number of home closings in our more profitable markets and 40 basis points resulting from the recognition of 580 million of previously deferred gross profit in accordance with sfas no 66 during 2007 compared to 16 million in 2006 

 

in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” land inventory and related development costs are reviewed for potential writedowns when impairment indicators are present sfas no 144 requires that in the event the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts impairment charges are required to be recorded if the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying amounts these estimates of cash flows are significantly impacted by estimates of the amounts and timing of revenues and costs and other factors which in turn are impacted by local market economic conditions and the actions of competitors due to uncertainties in the estimation process actual results could differ from such estimates for those assets deemed to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets our determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams 

 

in accordance with sfas no 144 impairment charges are also recorded on finished homes in substantially completed projects when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values are greater than the fair value less costs to sell these homes 

 

during fiscal 2007 the difficult conditions within the homebuilding industry became more challenging high inventory levels of both new and existing homes elevated cancellation rates low sales absorption rates affordability issues and overall weak consumer confidence persisted throughout the year the effects of these factors were further magnified by a decline in availability of mortgage products and higher mortgage interest rates on certain loan products due to credit tightening in the mortgage markets these factors combined with our disappointing sales results further declines in sales order prices and continued declines in gross profit from home sales revenues throughout the year caused our outlook for the homebuilding industry and its impact on our business to become more cautious as the year progressed our current outlook is that we believe 

housing market conditions will continue to be challenging and may deteriorate further and that the timing of a recovery in the housing market remains unclear 

 

during fiscal 2007 our quarterly inventory impairment analyses performed in accordance with sfas no 144 utilized assumptions that incorporated our cautious outlook which reflects the expectation that the challenging conditions in the homebuilding industry will persist and have a greater impact than we believed when the year began consequently our strategy to reduce our inventory and lot position in a number of markets will likely take longer and require additional price concessions and incentives than previously anticipated therefore our impairment evaluations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 indicated a significant number of projects with impairment indicators communities with a combined carrying value of 26224 million as of september 30 2007 had indicators of potential impairment and were evaluated for impairment the analysis of each of these projects generally assumed that sales prices in future periods will be equal to or lower than current sales order prices in each project or for comparable projects in order to generate an acceptable absorption rate while it is difficult to determine a timeframe for a given project in the current market conditions we estimated the remaining lives of these projects to range from six months to in excess of ten years through these evaluations we determined that projects with a carrying value of 9405 million as of september 30 2007 the largest portions of which were in the california west and southeast regions were impaired as a result during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 we recorded impairment charges totaling 2783 million to reduce the carrying value of the impaired projects to their estimated fair value these fourth quarter charges combined with impairment charges recorded earlier in the year resulted in total inventory impairment charges of 12222 million during fiscal 2007 approximately 74 of these impairment charges were recorded to residential land and lots and land held for development and approximately 26 of these charges were recorded to residential construction in progress and finished homes in inventory during fiscal 2006 we recorded impairment charges totaling 1462 million related to projects with a carrying value of 4593 million the majority of which were in california 

 

of the remaining 16819 million of such projects with impairment indicators which were determined not to be impaired at september 30 2007 the largest concentrations are in california 28 florida 20 and arizona 16 it is possible that our estimate of undiscounted cash flows from these projects may change and could result in a future need to record impairment charges to write these assets down to fair value additionally if conditions in the homebuilding industry or specific markets in which we operate worsen in the future beyond current expectations and as we reevaluate specific project pricing and incentive strategies we may be required to evaluate additional projects or reevaluate previously impaired projects for potential impairment these evaluations may result in additional impairment charges and such charges could be material 

 

based on a review of land and lot option contracts performed each quarter we write off earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs related to land and lot option contracts which we no longer plan to pursue during fiscal 2007 and 2006 we wrote off 1073 million and 1247 million respectively of earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs related to land purchase option contracts should the current weak homebuilding market conditions persist and we are unable to successfully renegotiate certain land purchase contracts we may write off additional earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs 

 

the inventory impairment charges and writeoffs of earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs reduced total homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding revenues by approximately 1200 basis points in fiscal 2007 compared to 180 basis points in fiscal 2006 

 

selling general and administrative sga expense 

 

sga expenses from homebuilding activities decreased by 3151 million or 22 to 11415 million in 2007 from 14566 million in 2006 as a percentage of homebuilding revenues sga expenses increased 40 basis points to 103 in 2007 from 99 in 2006 due to a decrease in revenues the largest component of our homebuilding sga is employee compensation and related costs which represented 59 and 64 of sga costs in 2007 and 2006 respectively those costs decreased 2602 million or 28 to 6722 million in 2007 from 9324 million in 2006 largely due to our continued efforts to align the number of employees to 

match our current and anticipated home closing levels as well as a decrease in incentive compensation which is primarily based on profitability our homebuilding operations employed approximately 5100 and 7100 employees at september 30 2007 and 2006 respectively the remaining decrease in sga of 549 million was primarily attributable to decreases in subdivision maintenance advertising costs and professional consulting fees 

 

we continue to adjust our sga infrastructure to support our expected closings volume however we cannot make assurances that our actions will permit us to maintain or improve upon the current sga expense as a percentage of revenues if our volume of future home closings is lower than fiscal 2007 levels our future sga percentage may increase further 

 

interest incurred 

 

we capitalize interest costs only to inventory under construction or development during both fiscal years our inventory under construction or development exceeded our debt therefore we capitalized all interest from homebuilding debt interest amortized to cost of sales excluding interest written off with inventory impairment charges was 24 of total home and landlot cost of sales in 2007 compared to 21 in 2006 

 

interest incurred is directly related to the average level of our homebuilding debt outstanding during the period comparing fiscal 2007 with fiscal 2006 interest incurred related to homebuilding debt decreased by 6 to 3043 million primarily due to a 5 decrease in our average homebuilding debt 

 

loss on early retirement of debt 

 

in fiscal 2007 in connection with the early retirement of our 85 senior notes due 2012 we recorded a loss of approximately 121 million for the call premium and the unamortized discount and fees related to the redeemed notes in fiscal 2006 in connection with the early retirement of our 9375 senior subordinated notes due 2011 and our 105 senior subordinated notes due 2011 we recorded a loss of approximately 134 million for the call premium and the unamortized discount and fees net of any unamortized premium related to these redeemed notes similarly we recorded a loss of approximately 44 million related to the unamortized fees associated with the redemption and replacement of our revolving credit facility in fiscal 2006 

 

other income 

 

other income net of other expenses associated with homebuilding activities was 40 million in 2007 compared to 110 million in 2006 major components of other income in both years were interest income and gain on the sale of assets while in fiscal 2006 the increase in the fair value of our interest rate swaps was also a major component 

 

goodwill 

 

in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” we have restated our goodwill balances between reporting segments to reflect the revised aggregation of our operating regions that resulted from a realignment of our management structure during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 our colorado markets which were previously included in our southwest operating region are now included in our midwest operating region consequently we determined that our midwest operating region which was previously included in our northeast reporting segment constitutes a separate reporting segment the following discussion of goodwill balances and related impairment charges is based on the revised alignment and disaggregation 

 

goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over net assets acquired we test goodwill for potential impairment annually as of september 30 or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the remaining balance of goodwill may not be recoverable in analyzing the potential impairment of goodwill sfas no 142 prescribes a twostep process that begins with the estimation of the fair value of the 

reporting units if the results of the first step indicate that impairment potentially exists the second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment if any impairment is determined to exist when the estimated fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value 

 

at june 30 2007 we determined that an interim test to assess the recoverability of goodwill was necessary because of the significant amount of inventory tested for impairment under sfas no 144 the market conditions in the homebuilding industry and the decline in our stock price we completed the first step of our goodwill impairment analysis as of june 30 2007 we estimated the fair value of our reporting units primarily utilizing the expected present values of future cash flows supported with a market based assessment of fair value for the reporting units and concluded an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated for operating regions within our northeast southeast california and west reporting segments as a result during the quarter ended june 30 2007 we recorded noncash impairment charges totaling 4256 million related to the writeoff of goodwill in these reporting segments 

 

during the quarter ended september 30 2007 we completed the second step of our goodwill impairment analyses through which we confirmed the appropriateness of our prior quarter writeoffs and determined that the goodwill balance related to our midwest reporting segment was completely impaired consequently the goodwill balance in our midwest reporting segment of 485 million which included 135 million transferred from the southwest reporting segment due to changing our management structure was written off in the fourth quarter total goodwill impairment charges for fiscal 2007 were 4741 million 

 

in addition at september 30 2007 we completed our annual impairment test and determined that the fair values of our south central and southwest reporting segments were greater than their carrying values and no impairment of goodwill existed in those segments 

 

reflecting the fiscal 2007 impairment charges and restatement of the prior year segment balances to conform to the current year presentation our goodwill balances by reporting segment as of september 30 2007 and 2006 were as follows 

 

 

 

the goodwill assessment procedures of sfas no 142 require us to make comprehensive estimates of future revenues and costs due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates actual results could differ from such estimates continued softness in the homebuilding industry may result in the determination that some or all of our remaining goodwill balance has become impaired which could result in additional goodwill impairment charges 

 

income taxes 

 

in fiscal 2007 the benefit from income taxes was 2387 million corresponding to the loss before income taxes for the year in fiscal 2006 the provision for income taxes was 7538 million corresponding to the income before income taxes for the year 

our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2007 was 251 compared to an effective tax rate of 379 in fiscal 2006 the effective tax rate during 2007 was lower than the effective tax rate in 2006 resulting in a reduced benefit from income taxes related to the loss in the year because only approximately 23 of the 4741 million goodwill impairment charge recorded in fiscal 2007 is deductible for tax purposes excluding the goodwill impairment charge the effective tax rate was 409 for fiscal 2007 

 

primarily as a result of recording significant inventory impairment charges during fiscal 2007 the balance of our deferred tax asset increased substantially the net deferred tax asset of 8638 million at september 30 2007 assumes that we will be able to realize the full value of these assets which will be dependent in part on our ability to generate sufficient profits in future periods if market conditions within the homebuilding industry do not improve or continue to worsen it may affect our ability to fully realize the value of these assets which may require a valuation adjustment and additional income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations and such expense could be material 

 

homebuilding results by reporting region 

 

northeast region  — homebuilding revenues decreased 22 in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to a 22 decrease in the number of homes closed as well as a slight decrease in the average selling price of those homes the region reported a loss before income taxes of 661 million in 2007 compared to income of 1129 million in 2006 the loss in fiscal 2007 was primarily due to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs totaling 815 million and goodwill impairment charges of 394 million a decrease in the region’s core home sales gross profit percentage home sales gross profit percentage excluding impairments and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs of 450 basis points in 2007 compared to 2006 also contributed to the reduction in income before income taxes the core home sales gross profit percentage decline in our south carolina and new jersey markets had the greatest impact on the overall decrease in the region’s profitability 

 

midwest region  — homebuilding revenues decreased 38 in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to a 42 decrease in the number of homes closed partially offset by a slight increase in the average selling price of those homes the region reported a loss before income taxes of 2053 million in 2007 compared to income of 1113 million in 2006 the loss in fiscal 2007 was primarily due to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs totaling 1673 million and goodwill impairment charges of 485 million the majority of the inventory impairments relate to projects in our denver market a decrease in the region’s core home sales gross profit percentage of 210 basis points in 2007 compared to 2006 as well as an increase in construction defect expense in denver also contributed to the reduction in income before income taxes 

 

southeast region  — homebuilding revenues decreased 28 in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to a 24 decrease in the number of homes closed as well as a 6 decrease in the average selling price of those homes the region reported a loss before income taxes of 1316 million in 2007 compared to income of 3464 million in 2006 the loss in fiscal 2007 was primarily due to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs totaling 2102 million and goodwill impairment charges of 115 million a decrease in the region’s core home sales gross profit percentage of 1140 basis points in 2007 compared to 2006 also contributed to the reduction in income before income taxes the core home sales gross profit percentage decline in our florida markets had the greatest impact on the overall decrease the florida markets experienced rapid price increases in previous years which contributed to gross profit increases in 2005 and continued elevated gross profit in 2006 in 2007 high inventory levels of new and existing homes and increased levels of sales incentives and home price reductions were typical throughout florida resulting in substantial gross profit declines 

 

south central region  — homebuilding revenues decreased 13 in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to a 16 decrease in the number of homes closed partially offset by a 5 increase in the average selling price of those homes income before income taxes for the region was 1222 million in 2007 down 29 from 2006 income before income taxes as a percentage of the region’s revenues operating margin decreased 130 basis points to 61 from 74 in 2006 the decrease in operating margin in 2007 was primarily due to 

a decrease in the region’s core home sales gross profit percentage of 70 basis points in 2007 compared to 2006 the core home sales gross profit change was largely due to softening in the san antonio market where inventories of new and existing homes have increased resulting in increased levels of sales incentives being offered by builders the recording of inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs totaling 246 million in fiscal 2007 compared to 22 million in 2006 also contributed to the decline in the region’s profitability 

 

southwest region  — homebuilding revenues remained relatively flat decreasing only 1 in 2007 compared to 2006 due to a 6 decrease in the average selling price of homes closed offset by a 5 increase in the number of homes closed income before income taxes for the region was 2046 million in 2007 down 52 from 2006 operating margin decreased 1110 basis points to 104 from 215 in 2006 the decrease in operating margin in 2007 was primarily due to a decrease in the region’s core home sales gross profit percentage of 1080 basis points in 2007 compared to 2006 the core home sales gross profit change was largely due to declines in our phoenix market the phoenix market experienced significant price increases in previous years which contributed to gross profit increases in 2005 and continued elevated gross profit in 2006 in 2007 higher inventory levels of new and existing homes and increased sales incentives and home price reductions were more common in phoenix resulting in gross profit declines the recording of inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs totaling 268 million in fiscal 2007 compared to 48 million in 2006 also contributed to the decline in the region’s profitability 

 

california region  — homebuilding revenues decreased 38 in 2007 compared to 2006 due to a 39 decrease in the number of homes closed as well as a slight decrease in the average selling price of those homes the region reported a loss before income taxes of 7841 million in 2007 compared to income of 3463 million in 2006 the loss in fiscal 2007 was primarily due to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs totaling 5646 million and goodwill impairment charges of 3003 million all of our california markets have incurred inventory impairments with a larger concentration attributable to our southern california markets a decrease in the region’s core home sales gross profit percentage of 890 basis points in 2007 compared to 2006 also contributed to the reduction in income before income taxes core home sales gross profit percentage declines in our northern california markets had the greatest impact on the overall decrease as these formerly strong markets weakened in fiscal 2007 from 2006 most of our california markets experienced rapid significant home price increases in previous years which contributed to gross profit increases in 2005 but they also strained housing affordability for most potential homebuyers in california housing affordability remains an issue in california and credit tightening in the mortgage markets has significantly limited the availability of many mortgage products used extensively by california homebuyers in recent years in 2006 and 2007 increased levels of sales incentives and home price reductions were typical throughout california as builders attempted to increase demand for homes to reduce high inventory levels and to address affordability concerns resulting in gross profit declines 

 

west region  — homebuilding revenues decreased 26 in 2007 compared to 2006 due to a 29 decrease in the number of homes closed as well as a slight decrease in the average selling price of those homes the region reported a loss before income taxes of 1597 million in 2007 compared to income of 3658 million in 2006 the loss in fiscal 2007 was primarily due to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs totaling 2545 million and goodwill impairment charges of 744 million the majority of the inventory impairments relate to projects in our las vegas market a decrease in the region’s core home sales gross profit of 750 basis points in 2007 compared to 2006 also contributed to the reduction in income before income taxes the core home sales gross profit percentage decline in our las vegas market had the greatest impact on the overall decrease the las vegas market experienced rapid significant home price increases in previous years which contributed to gross profit increases in 2005 and continued elevated gross profit in 2006 but these price increases also strained housing affordability for many potential homebuyers there credit tightening in the mortgage markets has also significantly limited the availability of many mortgage products used extensively by las vegas homebuyers in recent years in 2007 inventory levels of new and existing homes were high and increased levels of sales incentives and home price reductions were typical in las vegas new home communities as builders attempted to increase demand for homes and address affordability concerns resulting in gross profit declines 

fiscal year ended september 30 2006 compared to fiscal year ended september 30 2005 

 

the following tables set forth key operating and financial data for our homebuilding operations by reporting segment as of and for the fiscal years ended september 30 2006 and 2005 based on our revised disaggregation of operating segments and the states within those segments we have restated the 2006 and 2005 amounts between reporting segments to conform to the 2007 presentation

homebuilding operating margin analysis 

 

 

 

net sales orders and backlog 

 

the value of net sales orders decreased 5 to 138952 million 51980 homes in 2006 from 146434 million 53232 homes in 2005 the number of net sales orders decreased 2 in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 reflecting the industrywide softening of demand for new homes in most homebuilding markets which began in fiscal 2006 factors that contributed to the slowing of demand included an increase in the supply of existing homes for sale a reduction in investor purchases an increase in incentives offered by homebuilders and sellers of existing homes and an increase in sales contract cancellation rates these factors affected our business most significantly in the fourth fiscal quarter when our net sales orders decreased 25 compared to the same quarter of fiscal 2005 

 

our annual cancellation rate increased to 28 in fiscal 2006 and our cancellation rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 increased to approximately 40 exceeding our typical historical range of 16 to 20 the higher overall cancellation rate for fiscal 2006 was primarily attributable to cancellations in many of our arizona california and florida markets a significant portion of the increase in cancellations was due to our prospective homebuyers being unable to sell their existing homes 

 

decreases in both the number and value of net sales orders in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 occurred in our northeast midwest southeast and california regions the decreases in sales in these regions were primarily attributable to the changes in market conditions described above partially offsetting the decreases in net sales orders was an 18 increase in net sales orders in our south central region where many of our markets did not experience the same slowdown in demand during fiscal 2006 

 

the average price of a net sales order in fiscal 2006 was 267300 a decrease of 3 from the 275100 average in fiscal 2005 during the year slight to moderate increases and decreases in average sales prices occurred among our regions resulting in our relatively flat average price compared to 2005 in general our ability to raise prices is dependent on the demand for our homes therefore the lack of any significant overall price appreciation during 2006 was due in large part to the decrease in demand and our increased use of sales incentives in many markets particularly the home price appreciation that occurred in many of our california arizona and florida markets during fiscal 2005 moderated and in many instances reversed during fiscal 2006 as part of our efforts to keep our core product offerings affordable for our target customer base adjustments to our product and geographic mix and pricing within our homebuilding markets also contributed to decreases in the average selling price 

 

at september 30 2006 the value of our backlog of sales orders was 51851 million 18125 homes down 11 from 58352 million 19244 homes at september 30 2005 the average sales price of homes in backlog was 286100 at september 30 2006 down 6 from the 303200 average at september 30 2005 the value of our sales order backlog decreased in five of our seven market regions led by decreases of 46 and 30 in our midwest and southeast regions respectively which is reflective of the difficult sales 

environment the average selling price of homes in backlog at september 30 2006 as compared to september 30 2005 reflected only slight to moderate increases and decreases among our regions 

 

home sales revenue and gross profit 

 

revenues from home sales increased 9 to 145454 million 53099 homes closed in 2006 from 133766 million 51172 homes closed in 2005 revenues from home sales increased in all seven of our market regions led by the northeast southwest and southeast regions with increases of 25 15 and 13 respectively the average selling price of homes closed during 2006 was 273900 up 5 from 261400 in 2005 the average selling price of homes closed increased by slight to moderate amounts in six of our seven market regions led by the southwest and southeast regions with increases of 17 and 11 respectively many markets especially some of the california arizona and florida markets which experienced the most price appreciation during fiscal 2005 experienced weakening demand in the latter part of fiscal 2006 resulting in declines in total and per home revenue as reflected in our net sales order volume demand slowed in a number of our markets during fiscal 2006 and in general we offered more incentives and price concessions to obtain home sales revenues from home sales in fiscal 2006 were increased by 16 million while revenues from home sales in fiscal 2005 were reduced by 922 million from changes in profit deferred pursuant to sfas no 66 

 

total homebuilding gross profit decreased by 4 to 33422 million in 2006 from 34883 million in 2005 including sales of both homes and landlots total homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding revenues decreased 300 basis points to 226 in 2006 from 256 in 2005 

 

gross profit from home sales as a percentage of home sales revenues decreased 150 basis points to 240 in 2006 from 255 in 2005 the primary factors reducing our home sales gross profit margin were the difficult market conditions discussed above which narrowed the range between our selling prices and costs of our homes in many of our markets and caused a decline of approximately 200 basis points in home sales gross margin in fiscal 2006 we had to utilize additional incentives in many of our markets due to the challenging sales environment sales incentives affect our gross profit margin by reducing the selling price of the home or by increasing the cost of the home without a proportional increase in the selling price an additional 45 basis points of home sales gross margin decline was a result of the decrease in the relative number of closings in markets such as california and nevada which had significant price appreciation in preceding years and therefore had above average gross margins in fiscal 2005 these declines were partially offset by an improvement of approximately 55 basis points related to the increase in home sales revenues and gross profit from the recognition of profit previously deferred in accordance with sfas no 66 the remaining improvement of 40 basis points was primarily due to a reduction in warranty and construction defect expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues 

 

during fiscal 2006 several communities under development that demonstrated potential impairment indicators with a combined carrying value of 7395 million at september 30 2006 were evaluated for potential impairment in accordance with sfas no 144 our analyses of these projects generally assumed flat to reduced revenues as compared with current sales orders for the particular project or revenues realized from comparable projects we determined that projects with a carrying value of 4593 million the majority of which were in california were impaired consequently we recorded impairment charges of 1462 million to reduce the carrying value of the impaired projects to their estimated fair value 

 

during fiscal 2006 and 2005 we wrote off 1247 million and 171 million respectively of earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs related to land purchase option contracts which we determined we would not pursue the inventory impairment charges and writeoffs of earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs reduced total homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding revenues by approximately 180 basis points in fiscal 2006 

 

selling general and administrative sga expense 

 

sga expenses from homebuilding activities increased by 2300 million or 19 to 14566 million in 2006 from 12266 million in 2005 as a percentage of revenues sga expenses increased 90 basis points 

to 99 in 2006 from 90 in 2005 the largest component of our homebuilding sga is employee compensation and related costs which represented 64 and 67 of sga costs in 2006 and 2005 respectively those costs increased 1151 million or 14 to 9324 million in 2006 from 8173 million in 2005 largely due to the addition of employees to support our previously planned growth the remaining increase in sga of 1149 million was primarily attributable to increases in advertising costs property taxes rent expense and subdivision maintenance these increases were due to the growth in our inventory levels and the competitive selling environment 

 

interest incurred 

 

we capitalize interest costs only to inventory under construction or development during both fiscal years our inventory under construction or development exceeded our debt therefore we capitalized all interest from homebuilding debt interest amortized to cost of sales excluding interest impaired was 21 of total home and landlot cost of sales in 2006 compared to 22 in 2005 

 

interest incurred is directly related to the average level of our homebuilding debt outstanding during the period comparing fiscal 2006 with fiscal 2005 interest incurred related to homebuilding debt increased by 19 to 3254 million due to a 34 increase in our average homebuilding debt interest incurred increased at a slower rate than our debt primarily because our debt during 2006 was more heavily weighted to our revolving credit facility which carried a lower interest rate than the weighted average interest rate of our senior and senior subordinated notes our efforts to replace older higher interest rate notes with notes bearing lower interest rates also contributed to the improvement in relative interest costs 

 

loss on early retirement of debt 

 

in fiscal 2006 in connection with the early retirement of our 9375 senior subordinated notes due 2011 and our 105 senior subordinated notes due 2011 we recorded a loss of approximately 134 million for the call premium and the unamortized discount and fees net of any unamortized premium related to these redeemed notes similarly we recorded a loss of approximately 44 million related to the unamortized fees associated with the redemption and replacement of our revolving credit facility in fiscal 2006 in fiscal 2005 in connection with the early retirement of our 9375 senior notes due 2009 we recorded interest expense of approximately 44 million for the call premium and unamortized fees net of the unamortized premium related to these redeemed notes 

 

other income 

 

other income net of other expenses associated with homebuilding activities was 110 million in 2006 compared to 157 million in 2005 the major component of other income in both 2006 and 2005 was the increase in the fair value of our interest rate swaps of 31 million and 95 million respectively also included in other income in 2006 and 2005 was interest income of 69 million and 39 million respectively 

 

homebuilding results by reporting region 

 

northeast region  — homebuilding revenues increased 24 in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to a 20 increase in the number of homes closed as well as a slight increase in the average selling price of those homes income before income taxes for the region was 17 lower in 2006 compared to 2005 and as a percentage of the region’s revenues decreased 400 basis points to 81 from 121 in 2005 this decrease was due to a decrease in the region’s core home sales gross profit percentage home sales gross profit percentage excluding impairments and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs with the gross margin declines in our virginia and coastal carolina markets having the greatest impact on the overall decrease additionally profitability was negatively affected by the recording of inventory impairment charges and land option cost writeoffs of 269 million in fiscal 2006 versus 04 million in fiscal 2005 

 

midwest region  — homebuilding revenues increased 6 in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to a 5 increase in the average selling price of homes closed as well as a slight increase in the number of homes closed income before income taxes for the region was relatively flat between the two years and as a 

percentage of the region’s revenues it decreased 30 basis points to 62 from 65 in 2005 this decrease was due to the effect of recording of inventory impairment charges and land option cost writeoffs of 325 million in fiscal 2006 versus 19 million in fiscal 2005 largely offset by an increase in land sales gross profit and gross profit related to the recognition of profit previously deferred in accordance with sfas no 66 

 

southeast region  — homebuilding revenues increased 12 in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to an 11 increase in the average selling price of homes closed as well as a slight increase in the number of homes closed income before income taxes for the region was relatively flat between the two years however as a percentage of the region’s revenues it decreased 250 basis points to 170 from 195 in 2005 this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the region’s gross profit percentage which was negatively affected by the recording of inventory impairment charges and land option cost writeoffs of 344 million in fiscal 2006 versus 38 million in fiscal 2005 excluding these charges we experienced similar core home sales gross profit margins in both fiscal years however we did experience a sharp decline in these margins during the second half of fiscal 2006 reflecting the softening market conditions especially in florida 

 

south central region  — homebuilding revenues increased 9 in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to an increase in the number of homes closed as well as a slight increase in the average selling price of those homes income before income taxes for the region was 26 higher in 2006 compared to 2005 and as a percentage of the region’s revenues increased 100 basis points to 74 from 64 in 2005 this increase in income before income taxes was primarily due to a decrease in the region’s selling general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues as gross margin for the region was comparable from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 

 

southwest region  — homebuilding revenues increased 17 in 2006 compared to 2005 due to a 17 increase in the average selling price of homes closed while the number of homes closed decreased 2 income before income taxes for the region was 15 higher in 2006 compared to 2005 however as a percentage of the region’s revenues it decreased 20 basis points to 215 from 217 in 2005 while core homebuilding margin was relatively flat in the phoenix market for the full fiscal year 2006 as compared with fiscal year 2005 we did experience a sharp decline in the phoenix market home sales gross margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 as compared with the earlier quarters 

 

california region  — homebuilding revenues remained relatively flat increasing only 1 in 2006 compared to 2005 reflecting a slight increase in the number of homes closed and a slight decline in the average selling price of those homes income before income taxes for the region was 54 lower in 2006 compared to 2005 and as a percentage of the region’s revenues decreased 1120 basis points to 95 from 207 in 2005 this decrease was due to a decrease in the region’s gross profit percentage which was significantly affected by a decline of approximately 600 basis points in the region’s core home sales gross margins with the largest declines in the sacramento and san diego markets in addition the recording of inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs of 1658 million in fiscal 2006 versus 92 million in fiscal 2005 had a significant negative impact on gross margins 

 

west region  — homebuilding revenues remained relatively flat increasing only 2 in 2006 compared to 2005 due to slight increases in both the number of homes closed and in the average selling price of those homes income before income taxes for the region was 13 lower in 2006 compared to 2005 and as a percentage of the region’s revenues decreased 390 basis points to 229 from 268 in 2005 this decrease was due to a decrease in the region’s gross profit percentage primarily attributable to lower gross margins in the las vegas market 

results of operations — financial services 

 

fiscal year ended september 30 2007 compared to fiscal year ended september 30 2006 

 

the following tables set forth key operating and financial data for our financial services operations comprising dhi mortgage and our subsidiary title companies for the fiscal years ended september 30 2007 and 2006 

 

 

 

 

 

financial services operating margin analysis 

 

 

 

mortgage loan activity 

 

the volume of loans originated and brokered by our mortgage operations is directly related to the number and value of homes closed by our homebuilding operations total firstlien loans originated or brokered by dhi mortgage for our homebuyers decreased by 24 in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 corresponding to 

the decrease in the number of homes closed of 22 the percentage decrease in loans originated was greater than the percentage decrease in homes closed due to a decline in our mortgage capture rate the percentage of total home closings by our homebuilding operations for which dhi mortgage handled the homebuyers’ financing to 66 in 2007 from 68 in 2006 home closings from our homebuilding operations constituted 95 of dhi mortgage loan originations in 2007 compared to 94 in 2006 these rates reflect dhi mortgage’s continued focus on supporting the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations the number of loans sold to thirdparty investors decreased by 29 in 2007 as compared to 2006 the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the number of mortgage loans originated 

 

during fiscal 2007 the market for certain nontraditional mortgage loans changed substantially resulting in the reduced availability of some loan products that had previously been available to borrowers the affected loan products were generally characterized by high combined loantovalue ratios in combination with less required documentation than traditional mortgage loans such loans constituted approximately half of our total originations during fiscal 2006 but such products declined substantially as a percentage of total originations during fiscal 2007 primarily in the third and fourth quarters as a percentage of total loans originated originations of traditional conforming conventional loans and fha or va insured loans increased significantly during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 to approximately 90 corresponding to the reduction in nontraditional mortgage loans 

 

financial services revenues and expenses 

 

revenues from the financial services segment decreased 29 to 2077 million in 2007 from 2908 million in 2006 the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the number of mortgage loans originated and sold the majority of the revenues associated with our mortgage operations are recognized when the mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to thirdparty investors additionally we increased our loan loss reserves from 156 million at september 30 2006 to 246 million at september 30 2007 to cover estimated losses on loans held in portfolio loans held for sale and future obligations related to loans sold with recourse the increase in this reserve resulted in a corresponding decrease to the gains on sale of mortgages and reflects the current market conditions related to nontraditional products as described above as well as potential repurchase obligations that exist on certain loans previously sold 

 

general and administrative ga expenses associated with financial services decreased 24 to 1538 million in 2007 from 2022 million in 2006 the largest component of our financial services ga expense is employee compensation and related costs which represented 75 and 77 of ga costs in 2007 and 2006 respectively those costs decreased 26 to 1149 million in 2007 from 1554 million in 2006 as we have aligned the number of employees with current and anticipated loan origination and title service levels our financial services operations employed approximately 1100 and 1700 employees at september 30 2007 and 2006 respectively as a percentage of financial services revenues ga expenses increased by 450 basis points to 740 in 2007 from 695 in 2006 the increase was primarily due to the reduction in revenue resulting from the decrease in mortgage loan volume during fiscal 2007 and an increase in loan loss expense discussed above fluctuations in financial services general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues can be expected to occur due to changes in the amount of revenue earned as some expenses are not directly related to mortgage loan volume 

 

interest and other income decreased 32 to 385 million in 2007 from 569 million in 2006 primarily due to the decreased volume of loan originations 

fiscal year ended september 30 2006 compared to fiscal year ended september 30 2005 

 

the following tables set forth key operating and financial data for our financial services operations for the fiscal years ended september 30 2006 and 2005 

 

 

 

 

 

financial services operating margin analysis 

 

 

 

mortgage loan activity 

 

total firstlien loans originated or brokered by dhi mortgage for our homebuyers increased 11 in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 the increase in loans originated or brokered was greater than our 4 increase in the number of homes closed because our mortgage capture rate increased to 68 in 2006 from 63 in 2005 home closings from our homebuilding operations constituted 94 of dhi mortgage loan originations in 2006 compared to 93 in 2005 reflecting dhi mortgage’s continued focus on supporting the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations 

the number of loans sold to thirdparty investors increased 41 in 2006 as compared to 2005 the increase was primarily due to the increase in the number of mortgage loans originated as well as the implementation of more efficient loan sale processes during fiscal 2006 additionally the increase in fiscal 2006 includes the effect of the sales of an unusually high volume of mortgage loans held at september 30 2005 

 

financial services revenues and expenses 

 

revenues from the financial services segment increased 24 to 2908 million in 2006 from 2351 million in 2005 the increase in financial services revenues was primarily due to the increase in the number of mortgage loans originated and sold partially offset by a slight decrease in the average mortgage revenues earned per loan sold the decline in revenue per loan was largely due to less favorable selling conditions for mortgage originations and the interest rate environment in fiscal 2006 compared to 2005 the majority of the revenues associated with our mortgage operations are recognized when the mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to thirdparty investors 

 

ga expenses associated with financial services increased 37 to 2022 million in 2006 from 1476 million in 2005 the largest component of our financial services ga expense is employee compensation and related costs which represented 77 and 76 of ga costs in 2006 and 2005 respectively those costs increased 39 to 1554 million in 2006 from 1116 million in 2005 largely due to the addition of employees to support our previously planned growth as a percentage of financial services revenues ga expenses increased by 670 basis points to 695 in 2006 from 628 in 2005 reflecting the growth of our financial services infrastructure at a faster rate than the growth in revenues during fiscal 2006 

 

interest and other income increased 63 to 569 million in 2006 from 349 million in 2005 primarily due to increases in loan origination volume and interest rates 

 

overview of current capital resources and liquidity 

 

we have historically funded our homebuilding and financial services operations with cash flows from operating activities borrowings under our bank credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities as we utilize our capital resources and liquidity to fund our operations we have focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet 

 

at september 30 2007 our ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital was 402 a decrease of 50 basis points from 407 at september 30 2006 net homebuilding debt to total capital consists of homebuilding notes payable net of cash divided by total capital net of cash homebuilding notes payable net of cash plus stockholders’ equity the decrease in our ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital at september 30 2007 as compared with the ratio a year earlier was primarily due to paying down our homebuilding debt with cash flows from operations partially offset by the decrease in retained earnings and cash our target operating range for net homebuilding debt to total capital is below 45 so the 402 ratio at september 30 2007 is in line with our operating target we remain focused on maintaining our liquidity and strengthening our balance sheet so we can be flexible in reacting to market conditions however future fiscal yearend net homebuilding debt to total capital ratios may be higher than the fiscal 2007 yearend ratio 

 

we believe that the ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital is useful in understanding the leverage employed in our homebuilding operations and comparing us with other homebuilders we exclude the debt of our financial services business because it is separately capitalized and its debt is substantially collateralized and not guaranteed by our parent company or any of our homebuilding entities because of its capital function we include homebuilding cash as a reduction of our homebuilding debt and total capital for comparison to our ratios of net homebuilding debt to capital above at september 30 2007 and 2006 our ratios of homebuilding debt to total capital without netting cash balances were 417 and 431 respectively 

 

we believe that we will be able to continue to fund our homebuilding and financial services operations and our future cash needs including debt maturities through a combination of our existing cash resources 

cash flows from operations our existing renewed or amended credit facilities and if needed the issuance of new securities through the public capital markets 

 

homebuilding capital resources 

 

cash and cash equivalents  — at september 30 2007 we had available homebuilding cash and cash equivalents of 2283 million 

 

bank credit facility  — during november 2006 we increased the size of our 215 billion unsecured revolving credit facility which includes a 10 billion letter of credit subfacility to 25 billion and extended its maturity by one year to december 16 2011 the revolving credit facility has an uncommitted 400 million accordion provision which could be used to increase the facility to 29 billion upon obtaining additional commitments from lenders the facility is guaranteed by substantially all of our whollyowned subsidiaries other than our financial services subsidiaries we borrow funds through the revolving credit facility throughout the year to fund working capital requirements and we repay such borrowings with cash generated from our operations and from the issuance of public securities we had 1500 million in cash borrowings outstanding on our homebuilding revolving credit facility at september 30 2007 and 8000 million in cash borrowings outstanding at september 30 2006 

 

our revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on our operations and activities including limits on investments cash dividends stock repurchases and incurrence of indebtedness and requires maintenance of a maximum leverage ratio a minimum level of tangible net worth and a minimum ratio of earnings before income taxes depreciation amortization asset valuation adjustments and noncash gains and losses to interest incurred at september 30 2007 we were in compliance with all of the covenants limitations and restrictions that form a part of our bank revolving credit facility and our public debt obligations our continued borrowing availability depends on our ability to remain in compliance with these covenants limitations and restrictions additionally if it appears that we will not be able to comply with these requirements in the future it could be more difficult and expensive to obtain additional financing 

 

the following table presents the levels required to maintain our compliance with the financial debt covenants associated with our revolving credit facility and the levels achieved as of and for the fiscal year ended september 30 2007 these debt covenants are required to be maintained by us and all of our direct and indirect subsidiaries collectively guarantor subsidiaries other than the financial services subsidiaries and certain inconsequential subsidiaries collectively nonguarantor subsidiaries 

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

in july 2007 through amendment to the revolving credit facility a restriction was removed that limited our ability to pay cash dividends to an annual amount not to exceed 50 of prior year consolidated net income under the amended agreement payment of dividends is permitted provided there is no payment 

default under the facility we are in compliance with certain financial covenants under the agreement and such payments do not cause us to be in noncompliance with those financial covenants 

 

under the debt covenants associated with our revolving credit facility if we have fewer than two investment grade senior unsecured debt ratings from moody’s investors service fitch ratings and standard and poor’s ratings services we would be subject to a borrowing base limitation and restrictions on unsold homes and residential land and lots 

 

the borrowing base covenant limits our additional homebuilding borrowing capacity to the amount determined under the arrangement which was in excess of our borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility the borrowing capacity under our homebuilding revolving credit facility was 23 billion at september 30 2007 and would not have been affected had the restriction been in place additional restrictions limit the ratio of our unsold homes to the trailing twelve months’ unit home closings to 40 and limit the ratio of our residential land and lots to tangible net worth to 150 at september 30 2007 these ratios were approximately 26 and 110 respectively although our ratings were in the lowest investment grade category at each agency and during fiscal 2007 they were placed on negative outlook by all the three rating agencies at september 30 2007 we still held investment grade ratings from all three rating agencies so the borrowing base limitation was not in effect 

 

in october 2007 moody’s investors service placed our senior debt rating under review for downgrade and in november 2007 standard and poor’s ratings services downgraded our senior debt rating by one level to bb which is below investment grade status 

 

repayments of public unsecured debt — on april 15 2007 we redeemed our 85 senior notes due 2012 at an aggregate redemption price of approximately 2606 million plus accrued interest concurrent with the redemption we recorded a loss related to the early retirement of debt of approximately 121 million representing the call premium and the unamortized discount and fees related to the redeemed notes we used proceeds from our revolving credit facility for the redemption 

 

shelf registration statements — we have an automatically effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission registering debt and equity securities which we may issue from time to time in amounts to be determined also at september 30 2007 we had the capacity to issue approximately 225 million shares of common stock under our acquisition shelf registration statement to effect in whole or in part possible future business acquisitions 

 

financial services capital resources 

 

cash and cash equivalents  — at september 30 2007 we had available financial services cash and cash equivalents of 413 million 

 

mortgage warehouse loan facility  — dhi mortgage has a 540 million mortgage warehouse loan facility that was renewed on march 30 2007 to extend its maturity from april 6 2007 to march 28 2008 under the accordion provision of the credit agreement the total capacity may be increased to 750 million upon obtaining additional commitments from lenders at september 30 2007 we had borrowings of 2678 million outstanding under the mortgage warehouse facility 

 

our borrowing capacity under this facility is limited to the lesser of the unused portion of the facility or an amount determined under a borrowing base arrangement under the borrowing base limitation the amount that may be drawn on our mortgage warehouse facility varies based upon the underlying product type of each eligible mortgage loan substantially all of our mortgage originations are eligible with advance rates typically ranging from 95 to 98 of the unpaid principal balance of each mortgage loan 

 

commercial paper conduit facility  — dhi mortgage also has a 600 million commercial paper conduit facility the “cp conduit facility” that matures june 27 2009 subject to the annual renewal of the 364day backup liquidity feature this credit facility which previously had a capacity of 12 billion was amended in december 2006 to reduce the capacity to 800 million and upon renewal of the backup liquidity feature in 

june 2007 was further amended to reduce the capacity to 600 million at september 30 2007 we had borrowings of 1200 million outstanding under the cp conduit facility 

 

in the past we have been able to renew or extend the mortgage warehouse loan facility and the cp conduit facility on satisfactory terms prior to their maturities and obtain temporary additional commitments through amendments of the respective credit agreements during periods of higher than normal volumes of mortgages held for sale the liquidity of our financial services business depends upon our continued ability to renew and extend these facilities or to obtain other additional financing in sufficient capacities the recent credit tightening in the mortgage markets has increased the financing costs related to mortgagesecured borrowings and may affect our ability to renew and extend these borrowing facilities on similar terms 

 

the mortgage warehouse loan facility and the cp conduit facility are not guaranteed by either dr horton inc or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt borrowings under both facilities are secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale and by restricted cash to the extent borrowings under the facility occur prior to the assignment of mortgage loans held for sale as collateral the mortgage loans assigned to secure the cp conduit facility are used as collateral for assetbacked commercial paper issued by multiseller conduits in the commercial paper market at september 30 2007 our financial services subsidiaries held total mortgage loans for sale of 5235 million all mortgage company activities have been financed with the mortgage warehouse facility the cp conduit facility or internally generated funds both of the financial services credit facilities contain financial covenants as to our mortgage subsidiary’s minimum required tangible net worth its maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and its minimum required net income in addition the cp conduit facility contains certain advance cessation triggers based on specified performance metrics of the company and its guarantor subsidiaries which govern the availability of credit under the facility at september 30 2007 our financial services subsidiaries were in compliance with all of the conditions and covenants of the mortgage warehouse loan facility and the cp conduit facility 

 

operating cash flow activities 

 

during the year ended september 30 2007 net cash provided by our operating activities was 14 billion as compared to cash used in operating activities during the prior year of 12 billion during fiscal 2007 we generated positive cash flows from operating activities as we produced operating profits excluding the impact of asset impairments and writeoffs we also limited our investments in inventory during fiscal 2007 as evidenced by a 7376 million decrease in owned inventory excluding the impact of impairments and writeoffs during the fiscal year compared to 31 billion of inventory growth in fiscal 2006 in light of the challenging market conditions we have substantially slowed our purchases of land and lots and our development spending on land we own and have restricted the number of homes under construction to better match our expected current rate of home sales and closings we plan to continue to reduce our number of homes under construction during fiscal 2008 by starting construction on fewer homes than we close and continue to significantly limit our development spending our ability to reduce our inventory levels is however heavily dependent upon our ability to close a sufficient number of homes during the year which may be negatively impacted if our sales order cancellation rate remains at elevated levels to the extent our inventory levels decrease during fiscal 2008 we expect to generate net positive cash flows from operating activities in fiscal 2008 should all other factors remain constant 

 

another significant factor affecting our operating cash flows in fiscal 2007 was the decrease in mortgage loans held for sale of 4994 million during the year the decrease in mortgage loans held for sale was due to a decrease in the number of loans originated during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 we expect to continue to use cash to fund an increase in mortgage loans held for sale in quarters when our homebuilding closings grow however in periods when home closings are flat or decline as compared to prior periods or if our mortgage capture rate declines the amounts of net cash used may be reduced or we may generate positive cash flows from reductions in the balances of mortgage loans held for sale as we did in fiscal 2007 

investing cash flow activities 

 

in fiscal 2007 and 2006 cash used in investing activities represented net purchases of property and equipment primarily model home furniture and office equipment such purchases are not significant relative to our total assets or cash flows but were reduced in fiscal 2007 in light of the weaker market conditions 

 

financing cash flow activities 

 

the majority of our shortterm financing needs are funded with cash generated from operations and borrowings available under our homebuilding and financial services credit facilities longterm financing needs of our homebuilding operations are generally funded with the issuance of new senior unsecured debt securities through the public capital markets our homebuilding senior and senior subordinated notes and borrowings under our homebuilding revolving credit facility are guaranteed by substantially all of our whollyowned subsidiaries other than our financial services subsidiaries 

 

borrowings by our mortgage subsidiary under the cp conduit facility are secured by the assignment of mortgage loans held for sale and restricted cash arising from borrowings under the facility prior to the assignment of the mortgage loans as collateral at september 30 2007 there were no borrowings under the facility prior to the assignment of mortgage loans held for sale and therefore no cash was restricted under this facility for this purpose at september 30 2006 the balance of cash restricted for this purpose was 2483 million 

 

during fiscal 2007 our board of directors declared four quarterly cash dividends of 015 per common share the last of which was paid on august 27 2007 to stockholders of record on august 17 2007 on october 24 2007 our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 015 per common share which was paid on november 16 2007 to stockholders of record on november 5 2007 the declaration of future cash dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon among other things future earnings cash flows capital requirements our financial condition and general business conditions 

 

changes in capital structure 

 

in november 2006 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 4632 million of our common stock and the repurchase of debt securities of up to 500 million these authorizations replaced the previous common stock and debt securities repurchase authorizations and were in effect through november 30 2007 as of september 30 2007 the full amount of both authorizations remained available for repurchases in november 2007 our board of directors renewed and extended both authorizations to november 30 2008 

 

in fiscal 2007 our primary nonoperating uses of our available capital were the repayment of debt and dividend payments which we expect to remain as our top priorities in fiscal 2008 we continue to evaluate our alternatives for future nonoperating uses of our available capital including the amounts of planned debt repayments dividend payments maintenance of cash balances and possible common stock repurchases based on market conditions and other circumstances and within the constraints of our balance sheet leverage targets our liquidity targets and the restrictions in our bank agreements and indentures 

 

contractual cash obligations commercial commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

our primary contractual cash obligations for our homebuilding and financial services segments are payments under shortterm and longterm debt agreements and lease payments under operating leases purchase obligations of our homebuilding segment represent specific performance requirements under lot option purchase agreements that may require us to purchase land contingent upon the land seller meeting certain obligations we expect to fund our contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business through our operating cash flows our homebuilding and financial services credit facilities and by accessing the public capital markets 

our future cash requirements for contractual obligations as of september 30 2007 are presented below 

 

 

 

 

  

at september 30 2007 our homebuilding operations had outstanding letters of credit of 977 million and surety bonds of 21 billion issued by third parties to secure performance under various contracts we expect that our performance obligations secured by these letters of credit and bonds will generally be completed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms when we complete our performance obligations the related letters of credit and bonds are generally released shortly thereafter leaving us with no continuing obligations we have no material thirdparty guarantees 

 

our financial services subsidiary enters into various commitments related to the lending activities of our mortgage operations further discussion of these commitments is provided in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” under part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts to procure land or lots for the construction of homes lot option contracts enable us to control significant lot positions with limited capital investment and substantially reduce the risks associated with land ownership and development within the land and lot option purchase contracts in force at september 30 2007 there were a limited number of contracts representing only 608 million of remaining purchase price subject to specific performance clauses which may require us to purchase the land or lots upon the land sellers meeting certain obligations also pursuant to the provisions of interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities — an interpretation of arb no 51” as amended fin 46 issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb we consolidated certain variable interest entities with assets of 658 million related to some of our outstanding land and lot option purchase contracts creditors if any of these variable interest entities have no recourse against us additionally pursuant to sfas no 49 “accounting for product financing arrangements” we recorded 561 million of land inventory not owned related to some of our outstanding land and lot option purchase contracts further discussion of our land option contracts is provided in the “land and lot position and homes in inventory” section that follows 

land and lot position and homes in inventory 

 

the following is a summary of our land and lot position and homes in inventory at september 30 2007 and 2006 

 

 

 

at september 30 2007 we owned or controlled approximately 230000 lots 27 of which were lots under option or similar contracts compared with approximately 323000 lots at september 30 2006 our current strategy is to continue to reduce our owned and controlled lot position in line with our reduced expectations for future home sales and closings through the construction and sale of homes opportunistic sales of land and lots along with critical evaluation of acquiring lots currently controlled under option 

 

at september 30 2007 we controlled approximately 63000 lots with a total remaining purchase price of approximately 18 billion under land and lot option purchase contracts with a total of 1093 million in earnest money deposits our lots controlled included approximately 18200 optioned lots with a remaining purchase price of approximately 5485 million and secured by deposits totaling 344 million for which we do not expect to exercise our option to purchase the land or lots but the contract has not yet been terminated consequently we have written off the deposits related to these contracts resulting in a net earnest money deposit balance of 749 million at september 30 2007 

 

we had a total of approximately 19900 homes in inventory including approximately 2000 model homes at september 30 2007 compared to approximately 28500 homes in inventory including approximately 1900 model homes at september 30 2006 of our total homes in inventory approximately 10600 and 14200 were unsold at september 30 2007 and 2006 respectively at september 30 2007 approximately 5000 of our unsold homes were completed of which approximately 1100 had been completed for more than six months at september 30 2006 approximately 5000 of our unsold homes were completed of which approximately 440 homes had been completed for more than six months our strategy is to continue to reduce our total number of homes in inventory and our number of unsold homes in inventory during fiscal 2008 in line with our reduced expectations for future home sales and closings 

 

seasonality 

 

we have typically experienced seasonal variations in our quarterly operating results and capital requirements before the current housing downturn we generally had more homes under construction closed more homes and had greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year this seasonal activity increased our working capital requirements for our homebuilding operations during the third and fourth fiscal quarters and increased our funding requirements for the mortgages we originated in our financial services segment at the end of these quarters as a result of seasonal activity our results of 

operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year 

 

in contrast to our typical seasonal results due to further deterioration of homebuilding market conditions during fiscal 2007 we incurred consolidated operating losses in our third and fourth fiscal quarters these results were primarily due to recording significant inventory and goodwill impairment charges also the increasingly challenging market conditions caused further weakening in sales volume pricing and margins as the fiscal year progressed although we may experience our typical historical seasonal pattern in the future given the current market conditions we can make no assurances as to when or whether this pattern will recur 

 

inflation 

 

we and the homebuilding industry in general may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation primarily because of higher land financing labor and material construction costs in addition higher mortgage interest rates can significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers we attempt to pass through to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices however during periods of soft housing market conditions we may not be able to offset our cost increases particularly higher land costs with higher selling prices 

 

forwardlooking statements 

 

some of the statements contained in this report as well as in other materials we have filed or will file with the securities and exchange commission statements made by us in periodic press releases and oral statements we make to analysts stockholders and the press in the course of presentations about us may be construed as “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 and the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 forwardlooking statements are based on management’s beliefs as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to management these forwardlooking statements typically include the words “anticipate” “believe” “consider” “estimate” “expect” “forecast” “goal” “intend” “objective” “plan” “predict” “projection” “seek” “strategy” “target” or other words of similar meaning any or all of the forwardlooking statements included in this report and in any other of our reports or public statements may not approximate actual experience and the expectations derived from them may not be realized due to risks uncertainties and other factors as a result actual results may differ materially from the expectations or results we discuss in the forwardlooking statements these risks uncertainties and other factors include but are not limited to

critical accounting policies 

 

general  — a comprehensive enumeration of the significant accounting policies of dr horton inc and subsidiaries is presented in note a to the accompanying financial statements as of september 30 2007 and 2006 and for the years ended september 30 2007 2006 and 2005 each of our accounting policies has been chosen based upon current authoritative literature that collectively comprises us generally accepted accounting principles gaap in instances where alternative methods of accounting are permissible under gaap we have chosen the method that most appropriately reflects the nature of our business the results of our operations and our financial condition and have consistently applied those methods over each of the periods presented in the financial statements the audit committee of our board of directors has reviewed and approved the accounting policies selected 

 

basis of presentation  — our financial statements include the accounts of dr horton inc and all of its whollyowned majorityowned and controlled subsidiaries we have also consolidated certain variable interest entities from which we are purchasing lots under option purchase contracts under the requirements of fin 46 all significant intercompany accounts transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation 

 

use of estimates  — the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ materially from those estimates 

 

revenue recognition  — we generally recognize homebuilding revenue and related profit at the time of the closing of a sale when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer in situations where the buyer’s financing is originated by dhi mortgage our whollyowned mortgage subsidiary and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment as prescribed by sfas no 66 the profit on such sales is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a thirdparty investor has been completed we include amounts in transit from title companies at the end of each reporting period in homebuilding cash when we execute sales contracts with our homebuyers or when we require advance payment from homebuyers for custom changes upgrades or options related to their homes we record the cash deposits received as liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are canceled we either retain or refund to the homebuyer deposits on canceled sales contracts depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances 

 

we recognize financial services revenues associated with our title operations as closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued both of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed we transfer substantially all underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies to thirdparty insurers we recognize the majority of the revenues associated with our mortgage operations when the mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to thirdparty investors origination fees and direct origination costs are deferred and recognized as revenues and expenses respectively along with the associated gains and losses on the sales of the loans and related servicing rights when the loans are sold we generally do not retain or service the mortgages that we originate but rather sell the mortgages and related servicing rights to thirdparty investors interest income is accrued from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold 

 

mortgage loans held for sale are generally carried at cost adjusted for changes in fair value after the date of designation of an effective accounting hedge based on either sale commitments or current market quotes some of the loans sold by dhi mortgage are sold with limited recourse provisions and may be required to be repurchased under certain conditions including if certain specified payments generally initial payments are not made by the borrowers we record loss allowances for loans held in portfolio and loans held for sale and 

reserves for losses related to loans sold with recourse utilizing estimates based on historical experience and current market conditions unhedged loans are stated at the lower of cost or market market is determined by either sales commitments or current market conditions 

 

inventories and cost of sales  — inventory includes the costs of direct land acquisition land development and home construction capitalized interest real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and home construction applicable direct overhead costs that we incur after development projects or homes are substantially complete such as utilities maintenance and cleaning are charged to sga expense as incurred all indirect overhead costs such as compensation of construction superintendents sales personnel and division and region management advertising and builder’s risk insurance are charged to sga expense as incurred 

 

land and development costs are typically allocated to individual residential lots on a prorata basis and the costs of residential lots are transferred to construction in progress when home construction begins we use the specific identification method for the purpose of accumulating home construction costs cost of sales for homes closed includes the specific construction costs of each home and all applicable land acquisition land development and related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each project any changes to the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial home closings in a project are generally allocated on a prorata basis to the remaining homes in the project 

 

when a home is closed we generally have not yet paid and recorded all incurred costs necessary to complete the home each month we record as a liability and as a charge to cost of sales the amount we determine will ultimately be paid related to completed homes that have been closed as of the end of that month we compare our home construction budgets to actual recorded costs to determine the additional costs remaining to be paid on each closed home we monitor the accuracy of each month’s accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on closed homes in subsequent months to the amount previously accrued although actual costs to be paid in the future on previously closed homes could differ from our current accruals historically differences in amounts have not been significant 

 

in accordance with sfas no 144 land inventory and related communities under development are reviewed for potential writedowns when impairment indicators are present sfas no 144 requires that in the event the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts impairment charges are required to be recorded if the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying amounts these estimates of cash flows are significantly impacted by estimates of the amounts and timing of revenues and costs and other factors which in turn are impacted by local market economic conditions and the actions of competitors due to uncertainties in the estimation process actual results could differ from such estimates for those assets deemed to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets our determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams 

 

in accordance with sfas no 144 impairment charges are also recorded on finished homes in substantially completed projects when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values are greater than the fair value less costs to sell these homes 

 

land inventory not owned  — we account for our land and lot option purchase contracts in accordance with the provisions of fin 46 fin 46 provides guidance for the financial accounting and reporting of interests in certain variable interest entities which fin 46 defines as certain business entities that either have equity investors with no voting rights or have equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entities to support their activities fin 46 requires consolidation of such entities by any company that is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the entities’ activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entities’ residual returns or both defined as the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity 

 

in the ordinary course of our homebuilding business we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts to procure land or lots for the construction of homes under such option purchase contracts we will fund a 

stated deposit in consideration for the right but not the obligation to purchase land or lots at a future point in time with predetermined terms under the terms of the option purchase contracts many of our option deposits are not refundable at our discretion under the requirements of fin 46 certain of the option purchase contracts result in the creation of a variable interest in the entity holding the land parcel under option 

 

in applying the provisions of fin 46 we evaluate those land and lot option purchase contracts with variable interest entities to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary based upon analysis of the variability of the expected gains and losses of the entity based on this evaluation if we are the primary beneficiary of an entity with which we have entered into a land or lot option purchase contract the variable interest entity is consolidated 

 

since we own no equity interest in any of the unaffiliated variable interest entities that we must consolidate pursuant to fin 46 we generally have little or no control or influence over the operations of these entities or their owners when our requests for financial information are denied by the land sellers certain assumptions about the assets and liabilities of such entities are required in most cases the fair value of the assets of the consolidated entities has been assumed to be the remaining contractual purchase price of the land or lots we are purchasing in these cases it is assumed that the entities have no debt obligations and the only asset recorded is the land or lots we have the option to buy with a related offset to minority interest for the assumed third party investment in the variable interest entity creditors if any of these variable interest entities have no recourse against us 

 

goodwill  — goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over net assets acquired in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” we test goodwill for potential impairment annually as of september 30 or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the remaining balance of goodwill may not be recoverable in analyzing the potential impairment of goodwill sfas no 142 prescribes a twostep process that begins with the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units if the results of the first step indicate that impairment potentially exists the second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment if any impairment is determined to exist when the estimated fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value 

 

warranty costs  — we have established warranty reserves by charging cost of sales and crediting a warranty liability for each home closed we estimate the amounts charged to be adequate to cover expected warrantyrelated costs for materials and labor required under one and tenyear warranty obligation periods the oneyear warranty is comprehensive for all parts and labor the tenyear period is for major construction defects our warranty cost accruals are based upon our historical warranty cost experience in each market in which we operate and are adjusted as appropriate to reflect qualitative risks associated with the type of homes we build and the geographic areas in which we build them actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts a 10 change in the historical warranty rates used to estimate our warranty accrual would not result in a material change in our accrual 

 

insurance claim costs  — we have and require the majority of the subcontractors we use to have general liability insurance including construction defect coverage and workers compensation insurance these insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims subject to certain selfinsured retentions deductibles and other coverage limits in some states where we believe it is too difficult or expensive for the subcontractors to obtain general liability insurance we have waived our traditional subcontractor general liability insurance requirements to obtain lower bids from subcontractors we selfinsure a portion of our overall risk partially through the use of a captive insurance entity which issues a general liability policy to us naming some subcontractors as additional insureds 

 

we record expenses and liabilities related to the costs to cover our selfinsured and deductible amounts under our insurance policies and for any estimated costs of potential claims and lawsuits including expected legal costs in excess of our coverage limits or not covered by our policies based on an analysis of our historical claims which includes an estimate of construction defect claims incurred but not yet reported projection of losses related to these liabilities is subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends in construction defect claims relative to our markets and the types of products we build claim settlement patterns insurance industry practices and legal interpretations among others because of the high 

degree of judgment required in determining these estimated liability amounts actual future costs could differ significantly from our currently estimated amounts a 10 change in the claim rate and the average cost per claim used to estimate the selfinsured accruals would result in a change of approximately 500 million in our accrual 

 

income taxes  — we calculate a provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible in determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns judgment is required differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 

 

stockbased compensation  — with the approval of our compensation committee consisting of independent members of our board of directors we from time to time issue to employees and directors options to purchase our common stock the committee approves grants only out of amounts remaining available for grant from amounts formally authorized by our common stockholders we typically grant approved options with exercise prices equal to the market price of our common stock on the date of the option grant the majority of the options granted vest ratably over a tenyear period 

 

on october 1 2005 we adopted the provisions of sfas no 123r “share based payment” which requires that companies measure and recognize compensation expense at an amount equal to the fair value of sharebased payments granted under compensation arrangements we calculate the fair value of stock options using the black scholes option pricing model determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions which involve a number of variables these variables include but are not limited to the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards the expected dividend yield and expected stock option exercise behavior in addition we also use judgment in estimating the number of sharebased awards that are expected to be forfeited 

 

recent accounting pronouncements 

 

in november 2007 the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 109 “written loan commitments recorded at fair value through earnings” sab no 109 which revises and rescinds portions of sab no 105 “application of accounting principles to loan commitments” specifically states that the expected net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of a loan should be included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings the provisions of sab no 109 are applicable to written loan commitments issued or modified beginning on january 1 2008 we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of sab no 109 

 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities — including an amendment of fasb statement no 115” the statement permits entities to choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings sfas no 159 is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s fiscal year that begins after november 15 2007 we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of sfas no 159 however it is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

in november 2006 the fasb issued emerging issues task force issue eitf no 068 “applicability of the assessment of a buyer’s continuing investment under fasb statement no 66 for sales of condominiums” eitf 068 establishes that an entity should evaluate the adequacy of the buyer’s continuing investment in determining whether to recognize profit under the percentageofcompletion method eitf 068 is effective for the first annual reporting period beginning after march 15 2007 the adoption of eitf 068 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” the statement defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas no 157 is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s fiscal year that begins after november 15 2007 we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of sfas no 157 however it is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

in june 2006 the fasb issued interpretation no 48 fin 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement 109” fin 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for recognizing measuring presenting and disclosing in the financial statements tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return including a decision whether to file or not to file in a particular jurisdiction fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 the impact of the adoption of fin 48 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

we are subject to interest rate risk on our longterm debt we monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and utilize both fixed and variable rate debt for fixed rate debt changes in interest rates generally affect the value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows conversely for variable rate debt changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument but may affect our future earnings and cash flows we have mitigated our exposure to changes in interest rates on our variable rate bank debt by entering into interest rate swap agreements to obtain a fixed interest rate for a portion of the variable rate borrowings we generally do not have an obligation to prepay fixedrate debt prior to maturity and as a result interest rate risk and changes in fair value would not have a significant impact on our cash flows related to our fixedrate debt until such time as we are required to refinance repurchase or repay such debt 

 

our interest rate swaps are not designated as hedges under sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in the fair values of the swaps and such changes are reflected in our statements of operations 

 

we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with our mortgage loan origination services we manage interest rate risk through the use of forward sales of mortgagebacked securities fmbs eurodollar futures contracts edfc and put options on mortgagebacked securities mbs and edfc use of the term “hedging instruments” in the following discussion refers to these securities collectively or in any combination we do not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 

 

interest rate lock commitments irlcs are extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and who meet defined credit and underwriting criteria typically the irlcs have a duration of less than six months some irlcs are committed immediately to a specific investor through the use of bestefforts whole loan delivery commitments while other irlcs are funded prior to being committed to thirdparty investors the hedging instruments related to irlcs are classified and accounted for as nondesignated derivative instruments with gains and losses recognized in current earnings hedging instruments related to funded uncommitted loans are designated as fair value hedges with changes in the value of the derivative instruments recognized in current earnings along with changes in the value of the funded uncommitted loans the effectiveness of the fair value hedges is continuously monitored and any ineffectiveness which for the years ended september 30 2007 2006 and 2005 was not significant is recognized in current earnings at september 30 2007 hedging instruments to mitigate interest rate risk related to uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale and uncommitted irlcs totaled 6304 million uncommitted irlcs the duration of which are generally less than six months totaled approximately 1544 million and uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale totaled approximately 1292 million at september 30 2007 the fair value of the hedging instruments and irlcs at september 30 2007 was an insignificant amount 

 

we also purchase forward rate agreements fras and economic interest rate hedges as part of a program to potentially offer homebuyers a below market interest rate on their home financing at september 30 2007 these potential mortgage loan originations totaled approximately 1249 million and were hedged with fras 

of 721 million and economic interest rate hedges of 5269 million in edfc put options and 296 million in mbs put options both the fras and economic interest rate hedges have various maturities not exceeding twelve months these instruments are considered nondesignated derivatives and are accounted for at fair value with gains and losses recognized in current earnings the gains and losses for the year ended september 30 2007 were not significant 

 

the following table sets forth principal cash flows by expected maturity weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value of our debt obligations as of september 30 2007 the interest rates for our variable rate debt represent the weighted average interest rates in effect at september 30 2007 in addition the table sets forth the notional amounts weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value of our interest rate swaps because the mortgage warehouse credit facility and cp conduit facility are secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale which are typically sold within 60 days the outstanding balances at september 30 2007 are included in the variable rate maturities for the fiscal year ending september 30 2008 at september 30 2007 the fair value of the interest rate swaps was a 01 million liability

 item 1 business tableend  

dr horton inc is the largest homebuilding company in the united states based on our domestic homes closed during the twelve months ended september 30 2006 we construct and sell high quality homes through our operating divisions in 27 states and 84 metropolitan markets of the united states primarily under the name of dr horton america’s builder dr horton inc is a fortune 500 company and our common stock is included in the sp 500 index and listed on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol “dhi” unless the context otherwise requires the terms “dr horton” the “company” “we” and “our” used herein refer to dr horton inc a delaware corporation and its predecessors and subsidiaries 

 

donald r horton began our homebuilding business in 1978 in 1991 we were incorporated in delaware to acquire the assets and businesses of our predecessor companies which were residential home construction and development companies owned or controlled by mr horton in 1992 we completed our initial public offering of our common stock from inception we have consistently grown the size of our company by investing our available capital into our existing homebuilding markets and into startup operations in new markets additionally we have acquired numerous other homebuilding companies which have strengthened our market position in existing markets and expanded our geographic presence and product offerings in other markets the effectiveness of our organic growth and acquisition strategies enabled us to become the largest homebuilding company in the united states a distinction we have maintained for our last five fiscal years our homes generally range in size from 1000 to 5000 square feet and in price from 90000 to 900000 for the year ended september 30 2006 we closed 53099 homes with an average closing sales price of approximately 273900 

 

through our financial services operations we provide mortgage banking and title agency services to homebuyers in many of our homebuilding markets dhi mortgage our whollyowned subsidiary provides mortgage financing services principally to purchasers of homes we build and sell we originate mortgage loans then package and sell them and their servicing rights to thirdparty investors shortly after origination on a nonrecourse or limited recourse basis our subsidiary title companies serve as title insurance agents by providing title insurance policies examination and closing services primarily to purchasers of homes we build and sell 

 

our financial reporting segments consist of six homebuilding segments and a financial services segment our homebuilding operations are by far the most substantial part of our business comprising approximately 98 of consolidated revenues and approximately 95 of consolidated income before income taxes in fiscal 2006 during fiscal 2006 our total consolidated revenues were 151 billion and our total consolidated income before income taxes was 20 billion our homebuilding reporting segments generate most of their revenues from the sale of completed homes with a lesser amount from the sale of land and lots in addition to building traditional singlefamily detached homes the homebuilding segments also build attached homes such as town homes duplexes triplexes and condominiums including some midrise buildings which share common walls and roofs the sale of detached homes generated approximately 80 83 and 84 of home sales revenues in fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively our financial services segment generates its revenues from originating and selling mortgages and collecting fees for title insurance agency and closing services

operating strategy 

 

our overall operating strategy has long been to take advantage of opportunities to grow our homebuilding business profitably through capturing greater market share while continuing to maintain a strong balance sheet to execute our strategy we have invested our available capital in our existing homebuilding markets through our capital allocation process and entered satellite markets as opportunities were available we have also evaluated homebuilding acquisition opportunities as they arose the market conditions in our homebuilding markets have softened considerably during the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 although we believe the longterm fundamentals which support home sales demand remain solid and the current negative conditions in many of our markets will moderate over time we cannot predict the duration and severity of the current market conditions consequently while our longterm strategy remains to continue to profitably grow our homebuilding business our focus while the market conditions are weaker will primarily be upon continued strengthening of the financial condition of the company by reducing inventories of homes and land thereby increasing liquidity 

 

geographic diversity 

 

from 1978 to late 1987 our homebuilding activities were conducted in the dallasfort worth area we then began diversifying geographically by entering additional markets both through startup operations and acquisitions we now operate in 27 states and 84 markets this provides us with geographic diversification in our homebuilding inventory investments and our sources of revenues and earnings 

 

we believe our diversification strategy mitigates the effects of local and regional economic cycles and enhances our growth potential typically we do not invest material amounts of capital in real estate including raw land developed lots models and speculative homes or overhead in startup operations in new markets until such markets demonstrate growth potential and acceptance of our products while we believe there are longterm growth opportunities in our existing markets we also intend to continue our diversification strategy by seeking to selectively enter new markets primarily through the opening of satellite operations in smaller markets near our existing operating divisions we also continue to evaluate opportunities to enter new markets or strengthen our presence in our existing markets through acquisitions of other homebuilding companies 

 

economies of scale 

 

we are the largest homebuilding company in the united states in terms of number of homes closed in fiscal 2006 by the same measure we are also either the largest or one of the five largest builders in many of our markets in fiscal 2006 we believe that our national regional and local scale of operations has provided us with benefits that may not be available in the same degree to some other smaller homebuilders such as 

 

  

our economies of scale have contributed to our strong homebuilding operating margins over the years our operating margins have provided us with operational flexibility to compete for additional market share in each of our markets and in new satellite markets versus our competitors with lower operating margins 

  decentralized operations 

 

we decentralize our homebuilding activities to give more operating flexibility to our local division presidents at september 30 2006 we had 41 separate homebuilding operating divisions some of which are in the same market area and some of which operate in more than one market area generally each operating division consists of a division president land entitlement acquisition and development personnel a sales manager and sales personnel a construction manager and construction superintendents customer service personnel a controller a purchasing manager and office staff we believe that division presidents and their management teams who are familiar with local conditions have better information on which to base decisions regarding local operations our division presidents receive performance bonuses based upon achieving targeted financial and operational measures in their operating divisions 

 

operating division responsibilities 

 

each operating division is responsible for 

 

  

— a feasibility study 

 

— soil and environmental reviews 

 

— review of existing zoning and other governmental requirements and 

 

— review of the need for and extent of offsite work required to meet local building codes 

 

  

centralized controls 

 

we centralize the key risk elements of our homebuilding business through our regional and corporate offices we have seven separate homebuilding regional offices generally each regional office consists of a region president legal counsel a chief financial officer a purchasing manager and limited office support staff each of our region presidents and their management teams are responsible for oversight of the operations of up to eight homebuilding operating divisions including 

 

 3 

   

our corporate executives and corporate office departments are responsible for establishing our operational policies and internal control standards and for monitoring compliance with established policies and controls throughout our operations the corporate office also has primary responsibility for direct management of certain key risk elements and initiatives through the following centralized functions 

 

  

cost management 

 

we control our overhead costs by centralizing certain administrative and accounting functions and by closely monitoring the number of administrative personnel and management positions in our operating divisions as well as in our regional and corporate offices we also minimize advertising costs by participating in promotional activities sponsored by local real estate brokers 

 

we control construction costs by striving to design our homes efficiently and by obtaining competitive bids for construction materials and labor we also negotiate favorable pricing from our primary subcontractors and suppliers based on the volume of services and products we purchase from them on a local regional and national basis we monitor our construction costs on each house through our purchasing and construction budgeting systems and we monitor our inventory levels margins returns and expenses through our management information systems 

 

acquisitions 

 

we have recently focused on internal growth strengthening our balance sheet and increasing our liquidity however as an integral component of our operational strategy we continue to evaluate opportunities for strategic acquisitions we believe that in some instances expanding our operations through the acquisition of existing homebuilding companies can provide us benefits not found in startup operations such as 

 

  

in evaluating potential acquisition candidates we seek homebuilding companies that have excellent reputations track records of profitability and strong management teams we seek to limit the risks associated with acquiring such companies by conducting extensive operational financial and legal due diligence on each 

  acquisition and by only acquiring homebuilding companies that we believe will have a positive impact on our earnings within an acceptable period of time we believe that our acquisition evaluation and due diligence processes combined with our decentralized operating approach with centralized controls have contributed to the successful integration of our prior acquisitions 

 

markets 

 

we conduct our homebuilding operations in all of the geographic regions states and markets listed below and we conduct our mortgage and title operations in many of these markets the names of the regions and the markets comprising each region reflect the aggregation of our homebuilding operating segments into six separate reportable regions 

 

 

 

 

  when evaluating new or existing homebuilding markets we consider the following local marketspecific factors among others 

 

  

land policies 

 

typically we acquire land after we have completed appropriate due diligence and generally after we have obtained the rights “entitlements” to begin development or construction work resulting in an acceptable number of residential lots before we acquire lots or tracts of land we will among other things complete a feasibility study which includes soil tests independent environmental studies and other engineering work and evaluate the status of necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements required to develop and use the property for home construction although we purchase and develop land primarily to support our homebuilding activities we also sell lots and land to other developers and homebuilders 

 

we also enter into landlot option contracts in which we obtain the right but generally not the obligation to buy land or lots at predetermined prices on a defined schedule commensurate with anticipated home closings or planned land development our option contracts generally are nonrecourse which limits our financial exposure to our earnest money deposited with land and lot sellers this enables us to control significant land and lot positions with minimal capital investment which substantially reduces the risks associated with land ownership and development 

 

almost all of our land positions are acquired directly by us we avoid entering into joint venture arrangements due to their increased costs and complexity as well as the loss of operational control inherent in such arrangements we are a party to a very small number of joint ventures that were acquired through acquisitions of other homebuilders all of these joint ventures are consolidated in our financial statements 

 

we attempt to mitigate our exposure to real estate inventory risks by 

 

 6 

   

construction 

 

our home designs are selected or prepared in each of our markets to appeal to local tastes and preferences of homebuyers in each community we also offer optional interior and exterior features to allow homebuyers to enhance the basic home design and to allow us to generate additional revenues from each home sold 

 

substantially all of our construction work is performed by subcontractors subcontractors typically are retained for a specific subdivision pursuant to a contract that obligates the subcontractor to complete construction at an agreedupon price agreements with the subcontractors and suppliers we use generally are negotiated for each subdivision we compete with other homebuilders for qualified subcontractors raw materials and lots in the markets where we operate we employ construction superintendents to monitor homes under construction participate in major design and building decisions coordinate the activities of subcontractors and suppliers review the work of subcontractors for quality and cost controls and monitor compliance with zoning and building codes in addition our construction superintendents play a significant role in working with our homebuyers by assisting with option selection and home modification decisions educating buyers on the construction process and instructing buyers on postclosing home maintenance 

 

construction time for our homes depends on the weather availability of labor materials and supplies size of the home and other factors we typically complete the construction of a home within four to six months 

 

we typically do not maintain significant inventories of construction materials except for work in progress materials for homes under construction typically the construction materials used in our operations are readily available from numerous sources we have contracts exceeding one year with certain suppliers of our building materials that are cancelable at our option with a 30 day notice in recent years we have not experienced delays in construction due to shortages of materials or labor that have materially affected our consolidated operating results 

 

marketing and sales 

 

we market and sell our homes through commissioned employees and independent real estate brokers we typically conduct home sales from sales offices located in furnished model homes in each subdivision and we typically do not offer our model homes for sale until the completion of a subdivision our sales personnel assist prospective homebuyers by providing them with floor plans price information tours of model homes and assisting them with the selection of options and other custom features we train and inform our sales personnel as to the availability of financing construction schedules and marketing and advertising plans as market conditions warrant we may provide potential homebuyers with one or more of a variety of incentives including discounts and free upgrades to be competitive in a particular market in the current weak market conditions we have significantly increased the level of incentives we are offering to homebuyers in many markets 

 

we advertise in our local markets as necessary we advertise in newspapers marketing brochures and newsletters we also use billboards radio and television advertising and our internet website to market the location price range and availability of our homes to minimize advertising costs we attempt to operate in subdivisions in conspicuous locations that permit us to take advantage of local traffic patterns we also believe that model homes play a substantial role in our marketing efforts so we expend significant effort to create an attractive atmosphere in our model homes 

 

in addition to using model homes in certain markets we build a limited number of speculative homes in each subdivision these homes enhance our marketing and sales efforts to prospective homebuyers who are relocating to these markets as well as to independent brokers who often represent homebuyers requiring a completed home within 60 days we determine our speculative homes strategy in each market based on local market factors such as new job growth the number of job relocations housing demand seasonality current sales contract cancellation trends and our past experience in the market we determine the number of speculative homes to build in each subdivision based on our current and planned sales pace and we monitor 

  and adjust speculative homes inventory on an ongoing basis as conditions warrant we typically sell a substantial majority of our speculative homes while they are under construction or immediately following completion however the softness in the current market conditions and related high cancellation rates have increased our speculative homes inventory to approximately 50 of our total homes in inventory as of september 30 2006 up from 41 as of september 30 2005 

 

our sales contracts require an earnest money deposit of at least 500 the amount of earnest money required varies between markets and subdivisions and may significantly exceed 500 additionally customers are generally required to pay additional deposits when they select options or upgrade features for their homes most of our sales contracts stipulate that when customers cancel their contracts with us we have the right to retain their earnest money and option deposits however our operating divisions occasionally choose to refund such deposits our sales contracts also include a financing contingency which permits customers to cancel and receive a refund of their deposits if they cannot obtain mortgage financing at prevailing or specified interest rates within a specified period our contracts may include other contingencies such as the sale of an existing home depending upon market conditions the sales contracts used in certain subdivisions may also contain restrictions aimed at limiting purchases of our homes by speculative investors who plan to purchase our homes and then quickly place the homes up for resale as a percentage of gross sales orders cancellations of sales contracts in fiscal 2006 were 28 and our quarterly cancellation rates increased throughout fiscal 2006 to 40 in the fourth quarter significantly higher than our typical historical range of 16 to 20 the length of time between the signing of a sales contract for a home and delivery of the home to the buyer closing averages between three and six months 

 

customer service and quality control 

 

our operating divisions are responsible for preclosing quality control inspections and responding to customers’ postclosing needs we believe that prompt and courteous response to homebuyers’ needs during and after construction reduces postclosing repair costs enhances our reputation for quality and service and ultimately leads to significant repeat and referral business from the real estate community and homebuyers we provide our homebuyers with a limited oneyear warranty on workmanship and building materials the subcontractors who perform the actual construction also provide us with warranties on workmanship and are generally prepared to respond to us and the homeowner promptly upon request in addition we typically provide a supplemental tenyear limited warranty that covers major construction defects and some of our suppliers provide manufacturer’s warranties on specified products installed in the home 

 

customer mortgage financing 

 

we provide mortgage financing services principally to purchasers of our homes in the majority of our homebuilding markets through our whollyowned subsidiary dhi mortgage dhi mortgage coordinates and expedites the entire sales transaction by ensuring that mortgage commitments are received and that closings take place in a timely and efficient manner dhi mortgage originates mortgage loans for a substantial portion of our homebuyers and when necessary to fulfill the needs of some homebuyers also brokers loans to thirdparty lenders who directly originate the mortgage loans during the year ended september 30 2006 approximately 94 of dhi mortgage’s loan volume related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations and dhi mortgage provided mortgage financing services for approximately 68 of our total homes closed 

 

for loans that it originates dhi mortgage packages and sells the loans and their servicing rights to thirdparty investors shortly after origination on a nonrecourse or limited recourse basis in markets where we currently do not provide mortgage financing we work with a variety of mortgage lenders that make available to homebuyers a range of mortgage financing programs 

 

title services 

 

we serve as a title insurance agent in selected markets by providing title insurance policies examination and closing services to purchasers of homes we build and sell through our subsidiary title companies we currently assume little or no underwriting risk associated with these title policies 

  employees 

 

at september 30 2006 we employed 8772 persons of whom 1432 were sales and marketing personnel 2764 were executive administrative and clerical personnel 2846 were involved in construction and 1730 worked in mortgage and title operations we had fewer than 20 employees covered by collective bargaining agreements employees of some of the subcontractors which we use are represented by labor unions or are subject to collective bargaining agreements we believe that our relations with our employees and subcontractors are good 

 

competition 

 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive we compete in each of our markets with numerous other national regional and local homebuilders for homebuyers desirable properties raw materials skilled labor and financing we also compete with resales of existing homes and with the rental housing market our homes compete on the basis of quality price design mortgage financing terms and location our financial services business competes with other mortgage lenders including national regional and local mortgage bankers and other financial institutions some of which have greater access to capital markets different lending criteria and potentially broader product offerings 

 

governmental regulation and environmental matters 

 

the homebuilding industry is subject to extensive and complex regulations we and the subcontractors we use must comply with various federal state and local laws and regulations including zoning density and development requirements building environmental advertising and real estate sales rules and regulations these requirements affect the development process as well as building materials to be used building designs and minimum elevation of properties our homes are inspected by local authorities where required and homes eligible for insurance or guarantees provided by the fha and va are subject to inspection by them these regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities in addition our new housing developments may be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets and other public improvements 

 

our homebuilding operations are also subject to a variety of local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning protection of health safety and the environment the particular environmental laws for each site vary greatly according to location environmental condition and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties 

 

our mortgage company and title insurance agencies must also comply with various federal and state laws and regulations these include eligibility and other requirements for participation in the programs offered by the fha va gnma fannie mae and freddie mac these also include required compliance with consumer lending and other laws and regulations such as disclosure requirements prohibitions against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures all of these laws and regulations may subject our operations to examination by the applicable agencies 

 

seasonality 

 

we have typically experienced seasonal variations in our quarterly operating results and capital requirements in prior years we generally had more homes under construction closed more homes and had greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year this seasonal activity increases our working capital requirements for our homebuilding operations during the third and fourth fiscal quarters and increases our funding requirements for the mortgages we originate in our financial services segment at the end of these quarters as a result our results of operations and financial position at the end of the third and fourth fiscal quarters are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year 

 

in fiscal 2006 57 of our consolidated revenues was attributable to operations in the third and fourth fiscal quarters in contrast to our typical seasonal results due to softening homebuilding market conditions during fiscal 2006 only 46 of our consolidated operating income was attributable to operations in the third 

  and fourth fiscal quarters this decrease was primarily due to the increased use of incentives to sell homes and inventory impairment charges and land option cost writeoffs recorded during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2006 we expect that we will experience our historical seasonal patterns of revenues and operating income in future fiscal years

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

discussion of our business and operations included in this annual report on form 10k should be read together with the risk factors set forth below they describe various risks and uncertainties to which we are or may become subject these risks and uncertainties together with other factors described elsewhere in this report have the potential to affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner 

 

because of the cyclical nature of our industry changes in general economic real estate construction or other business conditions could adversely affect our business or our financial results 

 

cyclical industry the homebuilding industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions such as 

 

  

these may occur on a national scale or may affect some of the regions or markets in which we operate more than others if adverse conditions affect any of our larger markets they could have a proportionately greater impact on us than on some other homebuilding companies 

 

an oversupply of alternatives to new homes such as rental properties and used or foreclosed homes including homes held for sale by investors and speculators can also depress new home prices and reduce our margins on the sales of new homes 

 

during fiscal 2006 the homebuilding industry experienced an industrywide softening of demand for new homes in many markets home price appreciation over the past several years had attracted real estate investors and speculators as price appreciation slowed in fiscal 2006 the demand from investors and speculators for new homes also slowed resulting in an increase in new homes available for sale at the same time existing homes offered for sale by investors and speculators increased in response to higher inventories of both new and existing homes homebuilders increased the use of sales incentives to continue to sell new homes in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2006 we experienced a decrease in our net sales orders due to a decrease in homebuyer consumer confidence and a related increase in sales contract cancellations both of which we believe were caused by the continued increase in the level of sales incentives offered by both builders of new homes and sellers of existing homes our use of incentives also contributed to significantly lower gross margins on the homes we closed during those quarters we cannot predict the duration or severity of the current market conditions nor provide any assurances that the adjustments we have made in our operating strategy to address these conditions will be successful 

 

risks related to national security continued military deployments in the middle east and other overseas regions terrorist attacks other acts of violence or threats to national security and any corresponding response by the united states or others or related domestic or international instability may adversely affect general economic conditions or cause a slowdown of the national economy 

  inventory risks inventory risks are substantial for our homebuilding business our longterm ability to build homes depends upon our acquiring land suitable for residential building at affordable prices in locations where our potential customers want to live we must anticipate demand for new homes and continuously seek and make acquisitions of land for replacement and expansion of land inventory within our current markets and for new markets in some markets this has become more difficult and costly 

 

the risks inherent in controlling or purchasing and developing land increase as consumer demand for housing decreases thus we may have acquired options on or bought and developed land at a cost we will not be able to recover fully or on which we cannot build and sell homes profitably our deposits for building lots controlled under option or similar contracts may be put at risk the value of undeveloped land building lots and housing inventories can also fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions in addition inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in reduced margins or losses in a poorly performing project or market in weak economic or market conditions we may have to sell homes or land for a lower profit margin or at a loss and we may have to record inventory impairment charges we cannot make any assurances that the measures we employ to manage inventory risks and costs will be successful 

 

during fiscal 2005 and the first part of fiscal 2006 our goals for years of supply for ownership and control of land and building lots were based on management’s expectations for future volume growth in light of the much weaker market conditions recently encountered our expectations have changed and we have significantly slowed our purchases of land and lots to reduce our inventory to better match our new reduced rate of production we have recently terminated numerous land option contracts and have written off earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs related to these option contracts we have also recorded inventory impairment charges related to some of our underperforming projects 

 

supply risks the homebuilding industry has from time to time experienced significant difficulties that can affect the cost or timing of construction including 

 

  

risks from nature weather conditions and natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes volcanic activity droughts floods and wildfires can harm our homebuilding business these can delay home closings adversely affect the cost or availability of materials or labor or damage homes under construction the climates and geology of many of the states in which we operate including california florida and texas where we have some of our larger operations present increased risks of adverse weather or natural disaster 

 

consequences as a result of the foregoing matters potential customers may be less willing or able to buy our homes or we may take longer or incur more costs to build them we may not be able to recapture increased costs by raising prices in many cases because of market conditions or because we fix our prices in advance of delivery by signing home sales contracts we may be unable to change the mix of our home offerings or the affordability of our homes to maintain our margins or satisfactorily address changing market conditions in other ways in addition cancellations of home sales contracts in backlog may increase as homebuyers cancel or do not honor their contracts in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2006 we experienced an increase in sales contract cancellations due to a decrease in homebuyer consumer confidence which we believe was caused by the continued increase in the level of sales incentives offered by both builders of new homes and sellers of existing homes we are not certain how long the increased level of cancellations will continue 

 

our financial services business is closely related to our homebuilding business as it originates mortgage loans principally to purchasers of the homes we build a decrease in the demand for our homes because of the foregoing matters may also adversely affect the financial results of this segment of our business consumer preferences for adjustable rate and other lowmargin loans may also adversely affect our financial services 

  results an increase in the default rate on the mortgages we originate may adversely affect the pricing we receive upon the sale of mortgages that we originate and our profitability on such loan sales 

 

increases in interest rates reductions in mortgage availability or increases in the effective costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business or our financial results 

 

most of our customers finance their home purchases through lenders providing mortgage financing in recent years interest rates have been at historical lows many homebuyers have also chosen adjustable rate interest only or other mortgages that involve initial lower monthly payments as a result new homes have been more affordable increases in interest rates or decreases in the availability of mortgage financing products however may adversely affect the market for new homes potential homebuyers may be less willing or able to pay the increased monthly costs or to obtain mortgage financing that exposes them to interest rate changes lenders may increase the qualification requirements needed for mortgages or adjust their terms to address any increased credit risk even if potential customers do not need financing changes in interest rates and the availability of mortgage financing products may make it harder for them to sell their current homes to potential buyers who need financing these matters may adversely affect the sales or pricing of our homes and may also reduce the volume or margins in our financial services business the impact on our financial services business may be compounded to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate through the various hedging strategies we employ 

 

we believe that the availability of fha and va mortgage financing is an important factor in marketing some of our homes we also believe that the liquidity provided by fannie mae and freddie mac to the mortgage industry is important to the housing market however the federal government has sought to limit the size of the homeloan portfolios and operations of these two governmentsponsored enterprises any limitations or restrictions on the availability of the financing or on the liquidity provided by them could adversely affect interest rates mortgage financing and our sales of new homes and mortgage loans 

 

significant expenses of owning a home including mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes generally are deductible expenses for an individual’s federal and in some cases state income taxes subject to various limitations under current tax law and policy if the federal government or a state government changes its income tax laws as has been discussed to eliminate or substantially modify these income tax deductions the aftertax cost of owning a new home could increase for many of our potential customers the resulting loss or reduction of homeowner tax deductions if such tax law changes were enacted without offsetting provisions could adversely impact demand for and sales prices of new homes 

 

governmental regulations could increase the cost and limit the availability of our development and homebuilding projects or affect our related financial services operations and adversely affect our business or our financial results 

 

we are subject to extensive and complex regulations that affect land development and home construction including zoning density restrictions building design and building standards these regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities as to the conditions we must meet prior to being approved if approved at all we are subject to determinations by these authorities as to the adequacy of water or sewage facilities roads or other local services in addition in many markets government authorities have implemented no growth or growth control initiatives any of these can limit delay or increase the costs of development or homebuilding 

 

new housing developments may be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets and other public improvements which could cause an increase in the effective prices for our homes in addition increases in property tax rates by local governmental authorities as experienced in response to reduced federal and state funding can adversely affect the ability of potential customers to obtain financing or their desire to purchase new homes 

 

we are subject to a variety of local state and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of health safety and the environment the impact of environmental laws varies depending upon the prior uses of 

  the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available these matters may result in delays may cause us to incur substantial compliance remediation and other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas 

 

our financial services operations are also subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations these include eligibility requirements for participation in federal loan programs compliance with consumer lending and similar requirements such as disclosure requirements prohibitions against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures they may also subject our operations to examination by the applicable agencies these factors may limit our ability to provide mortgage financing or title services to potential purchasers of our homes 

 

our substantial debt could adversely affect our financial condition 

 

we have a significant amount of debt as of september 30 2006 our consolidated debt was 60786 million in the ordinary course of business we may incur significant additional debt to the extent permitted by our revolving credit facility and our indentures 

 

possible consequences the amount of our debt could have important consequences for example it could 

 

  

dependence on future performance our ability to meet our debt service and other obligations will depend upon our future financial performance we are engaged in businesses that are substantially affected by changes in economic conditions our revenues and earnings vary with the level of general economic activity in the markets we serve our businesses are also affected by financial political business and other factors many of which are beyond our control the factors that affect our ability to generate cash can also affect our ability to raise additional funds for these purposes through the sale of debt or equity securities the refinancing of debt or the sale of assets changes in prevailing interest rates may affect our ability to meet our debt service obligations because borrowings under our credit facilities bear interest at floating rates and our “interest rate swap” agreements fix our interest rate for only a portion of these borrowings 

 

as of september 30 2006 the scheduled maturities of principal on our outstanding debt for the subsequent 12 months totaled 12178 million including 11917 million in financial services debt that must be renewed annually based on the current level of operations we believe our cash flow from operations available cash available borrowings under our credit facilities and our ability to access the capital markets and to refinance or renew our facilities in a timely manner will be adequate to meet our future cash needs we cannot however make any assurances that in the future our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that borrowings or access to the capital markets or refinancing or renewal facilities will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay or refinance our indebtedness or to fund other cash needs 

 

indenture and revolving credit facility restrictions our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes impose restrictions on our operations and activities the most significant restrictions relate to limits on investments cash dividends stock repurchases and other restricted payments incurrence of indebtedness creation of liens and asset dispositions and require maintenance of a maximum leverage ratio a minimum ratio of earnings before interest income taxes depreciation and 

  amortization to interest incurred minimum levels of tangible net worth and compliance with other financial covenants in addition the indentures governing our senior notes impose restrictions on the creation of liens if we fail to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants the trustees the noteholders or the lending banks as applicable could cause our debt to become due and payable prior to maturity if we do not maintain our current credit ratings available credit under our revolving credit facility is subject to limitations based on specified percentages of unsold homes developed lots and lots under development included in inventory and the amount of other senior unsecured indebtedness 

 

change of control purchase options if a change of control occurs as defined in the indentures governing many series of our senior and senior subordinated notes constituting 21500 million principal amount in the aggregate as of september 30 2006 we would be required to offer to purchase such notes at 101 of their principal amount together with all accrued and unpaid interest if any moreover a change of control may also result in the acceleration of our revolving credit facility and our financial services credit facilities if purchase offers were required under the indentures for these notes or these credit facilities were accelerated we can give no assurance that we would have sufficient funds to pay the amounts that we would be required to repurchase or repay at september 30 2006 we did not have sufficient funds available to purchase all of such outstanding debt upon a change of control 

 

impact of financial services debt our financial services business is conducted through subsidiaries that are not restricted by our indentures or revolving credit facility the ability of our financial services segment to provide funds to our homebuilding operations however is subject to restrictions in its own credit facilities these funds would not be available to us upon the occurrence and during the continuance of defaults under these facilities moreover our right to receive assets from these subsidiaries upon liquidation or recapitalization will be subject to the prior claims of the creditors of these subsidiaries any claims we may have to funds from this segment would be subordinate to subsidiary indebtedness to the extent of any security for such indebtedness and to any indebtedness otherwise recognized as senior to our claims 

 

homebuilding and financial services are very competitive and competitive conditions could adversely affect our business or our financial results 

 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive homebuilders compete not only for homebuyers but also for desirable properties financing raw materials and skilled labor we compete with other local regional and national homebuilders including those with a sales presence on the internet often within larger subdivisions designed planned and developed by such homebuilders we also compete with existing home sales the competitive conditions in the homebuilding industry can result in 

 

  

our financial services business competes with other mortgage lenders including national regional and local mortgage banks and other financial institutions mortgage lenders with greater access to capital markets or different lending criteria may be able to offer more attractive financing to potential customers 

 

when we are affected by these competitive conditions our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

 

our future operations may require additional capital which may not be available 

 

our operations require significant amounts of cash and our requirements for capital typically increase in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year we may be required to seek additional capital whether from sales of equity debt issuances or additional bank borrowings for the development and any future growth of 

  our business we can give no assurance as to the availability of such additional capital or if available whether it would be on terms acceptable to us moreover the indentures for our outstanding public debt and the covenants of our revolving credit facility contain provisions that may restrict the debt we may incur in the future if we are not successful in obtaining sufficient capital it could reduce our sales and may adversely affect our financial results 

 

we cannot make any assurances that our growth strategies will be successful 

 

since 1993 we have acquired many homebuilding companies although we recently focused on internal growth we may make strategic acquisitions of homebuilding companies in the future successful strategic acquisitions require the integration of operations and management and other efforts to realize the benefits that may be available although we believe that we have been successful in doing so in the past we can give no assurance that we would be able to identify acquire and integrate successfully strategic acquisitions in the future acquisitions can result in the dilution of existing stockholders if we issue our common stock as consideration or reduce our liquidity or increase our debt if we fund them with cash in addition acquisitions can expose us to the risk of writing off goodwill related to such acquisitions based on the subsequent results of the operating segments to which the acquired businesses were assigned the risk of writeoffs related to goodwill impairment increases during a cyclical housing downturn when profitability of our operating segments may decline moreover we may not be able to implement successfully our operating and growth strategies within our existing markets 

 

homebuilding is subject to home warranty and construction defect claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant 

 

as a homebuilder we are subject to home warranty and construction defect claims arising in the ordinary course of business as a consequence we maintain product liability insurance obtain indemnities and certificates of insurance from subcontractors generally covering claims related to workmanship and materials and create warranty and other reserves for the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built because of the uncertainties inherent to these matters we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will be adequate to address all of our warranty and construction defect claims in the future contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce we may be responsible for applicable selfinsured retentions and some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits additionally the coverage offered by and the availability of product liability insurance for construction defects are currently limited and costly we have responded to increases in insurance costs and coverage limitations in recent years by increasing our selfinsured retentions and claim reserves there can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted or become more costly

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

results of operations — fiscal year 2006 overview 

 

during fiscal 2006 the homebuilding industry experienced an industrywide softening of demand for new homes in many markets home price appreciation over the past several years had attracted real estate investors and speculators as price appreciation slowed in fiscal 2006 the demand from investors and speculators for new homes also slowed resulting in an increase in new homes available for sale at the same time existing homes offered for sale by investors and speculators increased in response to higher inventories of both new and existing homes homebuilders increased the use of sales incentives to continue to sell new homes in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2006 we experienced a decrease in our net sales orders due to a decrease in homebuyer consumer confidence and a related increase in sales contract cancellations both of which we believe were caused by the continued increase in the level of sales incentives offered by both builders of new homes and sellers of existing homes our use of incentives also contributed to significantly lower gross margins on the homes we closed during those quarters although we believe the longterm fundamentals which support home sales demand remain solid and the current negative conditions in many of our markets will moderate over time we cannot predict the duration and severity of the current market conditions 

 

during fiscal 2006 we adjusted our operating strategy to meet the new homebuilding business environment and we expect to continue with these initiatives through fiscal 2007 these adjustments include 

 

  

we expect that these adjustments to our operating strategy will generate positive cash flows in fiscal 2007 and allow us to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity position providing us with flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they become available in the future because we cannot predict the duration or severity of the current market conditions we cannot provide any assurances that the adjustments we have made in our operating strategy to address these conditions will be successful 

 

key financial results as of and for our fiscal year ended september 30 2006 were as follows 

 

homebuilding operations 

 

 19 

   

financial services operations 

 

  

consolidated results 

 

  

although specific directives within our operating strategy may have changed or may be implemented at a slower pace our longterm operating strategy remains much the same we intend to continue to take advantage of opportunities to grow our homebuilding business profitability through capturing greater market share while maintaining a strong balance sheet we plan to continue investing our available capital in our existing homebuilding markets through our capital allocation process and entering satellite markets as opportunities are available we will also continue to evaluate homebuilding acquisition opportunities as they arise to the extent that additional capital is available in excess of amounts we choose to invest in our homebuilding operations or retain as liquidity we will consider directing such capital toward alternative uses including repayment of debt dividend payments or stock repurchases as market conditions or other circumstances may warrant within the constraints of our balance sheet leverage targets and the restrictions in our bank agreements and indentures

our seven homebuilding operating regions are our operating segments we present six reportable segments as we aggregate two of the operating regions into one reporting segment these reporting segments which we also refer to as reporting regions have homebuilding operations located in the following states 

 

 

  fiscal year ended september 30 2006 compared to fiscal year ended september 30 2005 

 

the following tables set forth key operating and financial data for our homebuilding operations by reporting region as of and for the fiscal years ended september 30 2006 and 2005 based on our revised aggregation of operating segments we have restated fiscal 2005 amounts between regions to conform to the fiscal 2006 presentation

net sales orders and backlog 

 

net sales orders represent the number and dollar value of new sales contracts executed with customers net of sales contract cancellations the value of net sales orders decreased 5 to 138952 million 51980 homes in 2006 from 146434 million 53232 homes in 2005 the number of net sales orders decreased 2 in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 reflecting the industrywide softening of demand for new homes in most homebuilding markets we believe the most significant factors contributing to the slowing of demand for new homes in most of our markets include an increase in the supply of existing homes for sale a reduction in investor purchases an increase in incentives offered by homebuilders and sellers of existing homes and an increase in sales contract cancellation rates many prospective homebuyers are approaching the purchase decision more tentatively due to the increased uncertainty surrounding the housing market these factors affected our business most significantly in our fourth fiscal quarter when our net sales orders decreased 25 compared to the same quarter of fiscal 2005 subsequent to fiscal year 2006 our net sales orders for the month ended october 31 2006 decreased 20 compared to the month ended october 31 2005 

 

our annual cancellation rate increased to 28 in fiscal 2006 and our cancellation rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and the month ended october 31 2006 increased to approximately 40 exceeding our typical historical range of 16 to 20 the higher overall cancellation rate for fiscal 2006 was primarily attributable to cancellations in many of our arizona california and florida markets a significant portion of the increase in cancellations was due to our prospective homebuyers being unable to sell their existing homes 

 

the largest percentage decreases in the number and value of net sales orders in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 occurred in our northeast southeast and california regions the decreases in sales in these regions are primarily attributable to the changes in market conditions described above partially offsetting the decreases in net sales orders was an 18 increase in net sales orders in our south central region where many of our markets did not experience the same slowdown in demand in fiscal 2006 

 

the average price of a net sales order in fiscal 2006 was 267300 a decrease of 3 from the 275100 average in fiscal 2005 during the year slight to moderate increases and decreases in average sales prices occurred among our regions resulting in our relatively flat average price compared to 2005 in general our ability to raise prices is dependent on the demand for our homes therefore the lack of any significant overall price appreciation during 2006 was due in large part to the recent decrease in demand and our increased use of sales incentives in many markets particularly the home price appreciation that occurred in many of our california arizona and florida markets during fiscal 2005 has since moderated and in many instances has reversed we also continually monitor and may adjust our product and geographic mix and pricing within our homebuilding markets in an effort to keep our core product offerings affordable for our target customer base typically firsttime and moveup homebuyers this sometimes also contributes to a decrease in the average price 

  sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies including mortgage loan approval which can result in cancellations in the past our backlog has been a reliable indicator of the level of closings in our two subsequent fiscal quarters although this relationship may change if our cancellation rates remain above normal levels or continue to increase historically our backlog conversion rates closings during the quarter divided by beginning of the quarter backlog have generally been in the range of 50 to 75 with the highest quarterly conversion rate of each fiscal year typically occurring in the fourth quarter 

 

at september 30 2006 the value of our backlog of sales orders was 51851 million 18125 homes down 11 from 58352 million 19244 homes at september 30 2005 the average sales price of homes in backlog was 286100 at september 30 2006 down 6 from the 303200 average at september 30 2005 the value of our sales order backlog decreased in four of our six market regions led by decreases of 31 30 and 26 in our northeast southeast and california regions respectively which is reflective of the current difficult sales environment the average selling price of homes in backlog at september 30 2006 as compared to september 30 2005 reflect only slight to moderate increases and decreases among our regions 

 

home sales revenue and gross profit 

 

revenues from home sales increased 9 to 145454 million 53099 homes closed in 2006 from 133766 million 51172 homes closed in 2005 revenues from home sales increased in all six of our market regions led by the northeast and southeast regions with increases of 22 and 13 respectively the average selling price of homes closed during 2006 was 273900 up 5 from 261400 in 2005 the average selling price of homes closed increased by slight to moderate amounts in five of our six market regions led by the southwest and southeast regions with increases of 12 and 11 respectively many markets especially some of the california arizona and florida markets which experienced the most price appreciation in recent years have experienced weakening demand in the latter part of fiscal 2006 resulting in declines in total and per home revenue as reflected in our net sales order volume demand has slowed in a number of our markets in recent quarters and in general we are offering more incentives and price concessions to obtain home sales 

 

revenues from home sales in fiscal 2006 were increased by 16 million while revenues from home sales in fiscal 2005 were reduced by 922 million from changes in profit deferred pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 66 “accounting for sales of real estate” the home sales profit related to our mortgage loans held for sale is deferred in instances where a buyer finances a home through our whollyowned mortgage company and has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment as prescribed by sfas no 66 as of september 30 2006 the balance of deferred profit related to such mortgage loans held for sale was 906 million 

 

total homebuilding gross profit decreased by 4 to 33422 million in 2006 from 34883 million in 2005 including sales of both homes and landlots total homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding revenues decreased 300 basis points to 226 in 2006 from 256 in 2005 

 

gross profit from home sales as a percentage of home sales revenues decreased 150 basis points to 240 in 2006 from 255 in 2005 the primary factors reducing our home sales gross profit margin were the difficult market conditions discussed above which narrowed the range between our selling prices and costs of our homes in many of our markets and caused a decline of approximately 200 basis points in home sales gross margin we have had to utilize additional incentives in many of our markets due to the current challenging sales environment sales incentives affect our gross profit margin by reducing the selling price of the home or by increasing the cost of the home without a proportional increase in the selling price an additional 45 basis points of home sales gross margin decline was a result of the decrease in the relative number of closings in markets such as california and nevada which have had significant price appreciation in the last few years and therefore have had above average gross margins these declines were partially offset by an improvement of approximately 55 basis points related to the increase in home sales revenues and gross profit from the recognition of profit previously deferred in accordance with sfas no 66 the remaining improvement of 40 basis points was primarily due to a reduction in warranty and construction defect expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues 

  in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” land inventory and related communities under development are reviewed for potential writedowns when impairment indicators are present sfas no 144 requires that in the event the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts impairment charges are required to be recorded if the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying amounts these estimates of cash flows are significantly impacted by estimates of revenues costs and other factors due to uncertainties in the estimation process actual results could differ from such estimates for those assets deemed to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets our determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams valuation adjustments on finished homes are recorded when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value is less than the fair value less costs to sell the home 

 

during fiscal 2006 several communities under development that demonstrated potential impairment indicators with a combined carrying value of 7395 million at september 30 2006 were evaluated for potential impairment our analyses of these projects generally assumed flat to reduced revenues as compared with current sales orders for the particular project or revenues realized from comparable projects we determined that projects with a carrying value of 4593 million the majority of which were in california were impaired consequently we recorded impairment charges of 1462 million to reduce the carrying value of the impaired projects to their estimated fair value the remaining 2802 million of such projects with impairment indicators are primarily in california it is possible that our estimate of undiscounted cash flows from these projects may change and could result in a future need to record impairment charges to write these assets down to fair value additionally if conditions in the homebuilding industry worsen in the future we may be required to evaluate additional projects for potential impairment which may result in additional impairment charges and such charges could be significant 

 

we periodically write off earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs related to land and lot option contracts which we no longer plan to pursue during fiscal 2006 and 2005 we wrote off 1247 million and 171 million respectively of earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs related to land purchase option contracts which we determined we would not pursue the inventory impairment charges and writeoffs of earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs reduced total homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding revenues by approximately 180 basis points in fiscal 2006 should the current weak homebuilding market conditions persist and if we are unable to successfully renegotiate certain land purchase contracts we may have to write off additional earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs we currently do not expect the potential for such writeoffs in fiscal 2007 to be as significant as the fiscal 2006 writeoffs 

 

selling general and administrative sga expense 

 

sga expenses from homebuilding activities increased by 2300 million or 19 to 14566 million in 2006 from 12266 million in 2005 as a percentage of revenues sga expenses increased 90 basis points to 99 in 2006 from 90 in 2005 the largest component of our homebuilding sga is employee compensation and related costs which represented 64 and 67 of sga costs in 2006 and 2005 respectively those costs increased 1151 million or 14 to 9324 million in 2006 from 8173 million in 2005 largely due to the addition of employees to support our previously planned growth the remaining increase in sga of 1149 million was primarily attributable to increases in advertising costs property taxes rent expense and subdivision maintenance these increases were due to the growth in our inventory levels and the competitive selling environment 

 

throughout fiscal 2005 and through the first half of fiscal 2006 we increased the infrastructure of our homebuilding operations to support the then planned delivery of approximately 58000 homes in fiscal 2006 and further growth in home closings into fiscal 2007 however due to recent sales trends the increase in home closings of only 4 in fiscal 2006 compared to 17 in fiscal 2005 and an actual decline in home closings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 compared to the same period of fiscal 2005 we no longer expect further growth in home closings in the near term we are adjusting our sga infrastructure to support our 

  decreased expectations of future closing volumes however we cannot provide assurance that future sga expense levels as a percentage of homebuilding revenues will be as low as historical levels 

 

interest expense 

 

we capitalize interest costs only to inventory under construction or development during both fiscal 2005 and 2006 our inventory under construction or development exceeded our interestbearing debt therefore we capitalized virtually all interest from homebuilding debt except for the call premium unamortized discountpremium and fees related to debt we paid off prior to maturity interest amortized to cost of sales was 21 of total cost of sales in 2006 compared to 22 in 2005 in fiscal 2006 in connection with the early redemption of our 9375 senior notes due 2011 and our 105 senior subordinated notes due 2011 we recorded interest expense of approximately 134 million for the call premium and the unamortized discount and issuance costs net of any unamortized premium related to these redeemed notes similarly we recorded interest expense of approximately 44 million related to the unamortized fees associated with the redemption and replacement of our revolving credit facility in fiscal 2006 in fiscal 2005 in connection with the early redemption of our 9375 senior notes due 2009 we recorded interest expense of approximately 44 million for the call premium and unamortized issuance costs net of the unamortized premium related to these redeemed notes 

 

excluding interest charges related to early retirement of debt and the replacement of our revolving credit facility interest incurred related to homebuilding debt increased by 19 to 3254 million in fiscal 2006 compared to 2729 million in fiscal 2005 the increase resulted from an increase in our average homebuilding debt of 34 in 2006 compared to 2005 interest incurred increased at a slower rate than our debt primarily because our debt has been more heavily weighted to our revolving credit facility in 2006 the revolving credit facility carries a lower interest rate than the weighted average interest rate of our senior and senior subordinated notes our ongoing efforts to replace our older higher interest rate notes with notes bearing lower interest rates also contributed to the improvement in relative interest costs 

 

other income 

 

other income net of other expenses associated with homebuilding activities was 110 million in 2006 compared to 157 million in 2005 the major component of other income in both 2006 and 2005 was the increase in the fair value of our interest rate swaps of 31 million and 95 million respectively also included in other income in 2006 and 2005 was interest income of 69 million and 39 million respectively 

 

goodwill 

 

at september 30 2006 we had 5789 million in goodwill which we evaluate for impairment annually or when circumstances warrant an earlier review we have allocated our goodwill to our reporting regions as follows as of september 30 2006 and 2005 northeast 744 million southeast 115 million south central 159 million southwest 1024 million california 3003 million and west 744 million although no impairment existed as of september 30 2006 if market conditions continue to deteriorate in our reporting regions our impairment review may result in goodwill impairment charges in the future 

 

homebuilding results by reporting region 

 

northeast region  — homebuilding revenues increased 22 in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to a 16 increase in the number of homes closed as well as a slight increase in the average selling price of those homes income before income taxes for the region was relatively flat between the two years however as a percentage of the region’s revenues it decreased 220 basis points to 90 from 112 in 2005 this decrease was due to a decrease in the region’s core home sales gross profit percentage home sales gross profit percentage excluding impairments and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs with the gross margin declines in our virginia and coastal carolina markets having the greatest impact on the overall decrease additionally profitability was negatively affected by the recording of inventory impairment charges and land option cost writeoffs of 385 million in fiscal 2006 versus 13 million in fiscal 2005 

  southeast region  — homebuilding revenues increased 12 in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to an 11 increase in the average selling price of homes closed as well as a slight increase in the number of homes closed income before income taxes for the region was relatively flat between the two years however as a percentage of the region’s revenues it decreased 250 basis points to 170 from 195 in 2005 this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the region’s gross profit percentage which was negatively affected by the recording of inventory impairment charges and land option cost writeoffs of 344 million in fiscal 2006 versus 38 million in fiscal 2005 excluding these charges we experienced similar core home sales gross profit margins in both fiscal years however we did experience a sharp decline in these margins during the second half of fiscal 2006 reflecting the softening market conditions especially in florida 

 

south central region  — homebuilding revenues increased 9 in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to an increase in the number of homes closed as well as a slight increase in the average selling price of those homes income before income taxes for the region was 26 higher in 2006 compared to 2005 and as a percentage of the region’s revenues increased 100 basis points to 74 from 64 in 2005 this increase in income before income taxes was primarily due to a decrease in the region’s selling general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues as gross margin for the region was comparable from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 

 

southwest region  — homebuilding revenues increased 10 in 2006 compared to 2005 due to a 12 increase in the average selling price of homes closed while the number of homes closed decreased 3 income before income taxes for the region was 10 higher in 2006 compared to 2005 and as a percentage of the region’s revenues was 152 in both years inventory impairment charges and land option cost writeoffs of 257 million in fiscal 2006 versus 13 million in fiscal 2005 contributed to an 80 basis point decline in the region’s gross margin this decline was offset by a 228 million increase in gross margin resulting from changes in profit deferred pursuant to sfas no 66 while core homebuilding margins were relatively flat in the denver and phoenix markets for the full fiscal year 2006 as compared with fiscal year 2005 we did experience a sharp decline in the phoenix market home sales gross margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 as compared with the earlier quarters 

 

california region  — homebuilding revenues remained relatively flat increasing only 1 in 2006 compared to 2005 reflecting a slight increase in the number of homes closed and a slight decline in the average selling price of those homes income before income taxes for the region was 54 lower in 2006 compared to 2005 and as a percentage of the region’s revenues decreased 1120 basis points to 95 from 207 in 2005 this decrease was due to a decrease in the region’s gross profit percentage which was significantly affected by a decline of approximately 600 basis points in the region’s core home sales gross margins with the largest declines in the sacramento and san diego markets in addition the recording of inventory impairment charges and earnest money and preacquisition cost writeoffs of 1658 million in fiscal 2006 versus 92 in fiscal 2005 had a significant negative impact on gross margins 

 

west region  — homebuilding revenues remained relatively flat increasing only 2 in 2006 compared to 2005 due to slight increases in both the number of homes closed and in the average selling price of those homes income before income taxes for the region was 13 lower in 2006 compared to 2005 and as a percentage of the region’s revenues decreased 390 basis points to 229 from 268 in 2005 this decrease was due to a decrease in the region’s gross profit percentage primarily attributable to lower gross margins in the las vegas market

net sales orders and backlog 

 

the value of net sales orders increased 28 to 146434 million 53232 homes in 2005 from 114062 million 45263 homes in 2004 the overall cancellation rates of the value of new sales contracts in 2005 and 2004 were 19 and 17 respectively the average price of a net sales order in 2005 was 275100 up 9 from the 252000 average in 2004 the number and value of net sales orders increased in all six of our market regions reflecting the execution of our organic growth strategies and the overall strong demand for our homes in fiscal 2005 

 

all regions produced doubledigit percentage increases in the value of net sales orders during fiscal 2005 led by our southeast and southwest regions with increases of 46 and 40 respectively the increase in our southeast region resulted from the continued expansion of our presence in our florida markets where housing demand was high the increase in our southwest region was primarily due to increases in homes sold and average sales price in our arizona and new mexico markets the average price of net sales orders increased at varying levels across all of our regions reflecting our ability to increase prices in markets where demand for our homes was strongest the highest percentage increases in average sales prices occurred in our southwest southeast and california regions while lesser increases were experienced in our west south central and northeast regions in the northeast region where demand was still strong our efforts to offer more lowerpriced products particularly in the chicago market resulted in an increase of only 1 in the average sales price 

 

at september 30 2005 the value of our backlog of sales orders was 58352 million 19244 homes up 28 from 45685 million 17184 homes at september 30 2004 the average sales price of homes in backlog was 303200 at september 30 2005 up 14 from the 265900 average at september 30 2004 the value of our sales order backlog increased in four of our six market regions led by increases of 50 in both our northeast and southwest regions the average selling price of homes in backlog increased in all of our market regions with the largest percentage increases occurring in our southeast and southwest regions where generally strong demand for our homes allowed us to increase prices 

 

home sales revenue and gross profit 

 

revenues from home sales increased 28 to 133766 million 51172 homes closed in 2005 from 104911 million 43567 homes closed in 2004 revenues from home sales increased by 20 or more in four of our six market regions and the number of homes closed increased by more than 10 in five of our six market regions these results reflect the execution of our growth strategies continued strength in demand for new homes and our homebuilding divisions’ ability to efficiently deliver homes in backlog to homebuyers the average selling price of homes closed during 2005 was 261400 up 9 from 240800 in 2004 the average selling price of homes closed increased by more than 10 in four of our six market regions 

  revenues from home sales in fiscal 2005 were reduced by a 922 million deferral of profit at september 30 2005 pursuant to sfas no 66 

 

total homebuilding gross profit increased by 42 to 34883 million in 2005 from 24607 million in 2004 including sales of both homes and landlots total homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding revenues increased 250 basis points to 256 in 2005 from 231 in 2004 gross profit from home sales as a percentage of home sales revenues increased 250 basis points to 255 in 2005 from 230 in 2004 of the 250 basis point improvement in home sales gross profit percentage approximately 170 basis points was due to market conditions that led to strong demand for our homes those conditions allowed us to raise the selling prices of our homes more rapidly than the overall increases in the construction costs of our homes in the majority of our markets our largest selling price and gross profit increases were obtained in our florida and arizona markets an additional 70 basis points of the improvement in home sales gross profit percentage was due to a decrease in the capitalized interest amortized to cost of sales as a percentage of home sales revenues which was attributable to our homebuilding leverage ratio improvement and our debt refinancing efforts over the past two years the remaining home sales gross profit percentage improvement related primarily to the relative increase in closings in our more profitable markets due to our efforts to reallocate capital to these markets 

 

selling general and administrative expense 

 

sga expenses from homebuilding activities increased by 2676 million or 28 to 12266 million in 2005 from 9590 million in 2004 as a percentage of revenues sga expenses were 90 in both years the largest component of our homebuilding sga is employee compensation and related costs which represented 67 and 65 of sga costs in 2005 and 2004 respectively those costs increased 1924 million or 31 to 8173 million in 2005 from 6249 million in 2004 largely due to the addition of employees to support our growth the remaining increase in sga of 752 million was primarily attributable to increases in advertising costs rent expense subdivision maintenance and model home furniture depreciation 

 

interest expense 

 

interest incurred related to homebuilding debt increased by 17 to 2773 million in 2005 from 2367 million in 2004 while our average daily homebuilding debt increased 26 in 2005 from 2004 the percentage increase in our average homebuilding debt was higher than the percentage increase in our interest incurred due to the march 2004 restructuring of our unsecured revolving credit facility which resulted in lower borrowing costs throughout 2005 and due to our efforts over the past two fiscal years to replace some of our higher interest rate notes with notes bearing lower interest rates 

 

we capitalize interest costs only to inventory under construction or development during both fiscal years our inventory under construction or development exceeded our interestbearing debt therefore we capitalized all interest from homebuilding debt except for the unamortized discounts premiums and fees related to debt we paid off prior to maturity interest amortized to cost of sales decreased by 10 to 2250 million in 2005 from 2490 million in 2004 this reduction in interest amortized to total cost of sales is a direct result of the reductions in our homebuilding leverage and our debt refinancing efforts over the last two years 

 

other income 

 

other income net of other expenses associated with homebuilding activities was 157 million in 2005 compared to 99 million in 2004 the major component of other income in both 2005 and 2004 was the increase in the fair value of our interest rate swaps of 95 million and 81 million respectively also included in other income in 2005 and 2004 was interest income of 39 million and 22 million respectively 

  homebuilding results by reporting region 

 

northeast region  — homebuilding revenues increased 19 in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to an increase in the number of homes closed as well as a slight increase in the average selling price of those homes income before income taxes for the region was 29 higher in 2005 compared to 2004 and as a percentage of the region’s revenues increased 90 basis points to 112 from 103 in 2004 this increase was due to an increase in the region’s home sales gross profit percentage with the gross margin improvements in our virginia and coastal carolina markets having the greatest impact on the overall increase 

 

southeast region  — homebuilding revenues increased 71 in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to a 54 increase in the number of homes closed as well as a 12 increase in the average selling price of those homes reflecting an increase in housing demand and our increased investments in the region particularly in florida income before income taxes for the region was 135 higher in 2005 compared to 2004 and as a percentage of the region’s revenues increased 530 basis points to 195 from 142 in 2004 this increase was primarily due to an increase in the region’s home sales gross profit percentage particularly in our florida markets where the high demand for homes enabled us to both aggressively increase prices and close more homes 

 

south central region  — homebuilding revenues increased 16 in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to a 14 increase in the number of homes closed as well as a slight increase in the average selling price of those homes income before income taxes for the region was 16 higher in 2005 compared to 2004 however as a percentage of the region’s revenues it decreased 10 basis points to 64 from 65 in 2004 the increase in income before income taxes was primarily due to the increase in the number of homes closed while the slight decrease in income before taxes as a percentage of the region’s revenues was the result of home sales gross profit percentages decreasing slightly in 2005 compared to 2004 

 

southwest region  — homebuilding revenues increased 25 in 2005 compared to 2004 due to an 11 increase in the number of homes closed and a 13 increase in the average selling price of those homes reflecting an increase in housing demand particularly in arizona income before income taxes for the region was 98 higher in 2005 compared to 2004 and as a percentage of the region’s revenues increased 560 basis points to 152 from 96 in 2004 this increase was primarily due to an increase in the region’s home sales gross profit percentage particularly in our arizona and new mexico markets where the high demand for homes enabled us to more aggressively increase prices 

 

california region  — homebuilding revenues increased 19 in 2005 compared to 2004 due to a 9 increase in the number of homes closed and an 11 increase in the average selling price of those homes reflecting continued strong housing demand in california in 2005 income before income taxes for the region was 17 higher in 2005 compared to 2004 however as a percentage of the region’s revenues it decreased 30 basis points to 207 from 210 in 2004 largely due to an increase in sga as a percentage of the region’s revenues 

 

west region  — homebuilding revenues increased 49 in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to a 25 increase in the number of homes closed as well as a 13 increase in the average selling price of those homes reflecting the strong housing demand throughout the region in 2005 and our increased investments in the region particularly in nevada income before income taxes for the region was 77 higher in 2005 compared to 2004 and as a percentage of the region’s revenues increased 430 basis points to 268 from 225 in 2004 this increase was primarily due to an increase in the region’s home sales gross profit percentage particularly in our hawaii and oregon markets where we experienced significant price appreciation during fiscal 2005

the volume of loans originated and brokered by our mortgage operations is directly related to the number and value of homes closed by our homebuilding operations total firstlien loans originated or brokered by dhi mortgage for our homebuyers increased 11 in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 the increase in loans originated or brokered was greater than our 4 increase in the number of homes closed because our mortgage capture rate the percentage of total home closings by our homebuilding operations for which dhi mortgage handled the homebuyers’ financing increased to 68 in 2006 from 63 in 2005 home closings from our homebuilding operations constituted 94 of dhi mortgage loan originations in 2006 compared to 

  93 in 2005 reflecting dhi mortgage’s continued focus on supporting the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations 

 

the number of loans sold to thirdparty investors increased 41 in 2006 as compared to 2005 the increase was primarily due to the increase in the number of mortgage loans originated as well as the implementation of more efficient loan sale processes during fiscal 2006 additionally the increase in fiscal 2006 includes the effect of the sales of an unusually high volume of mortgage loans held at september 30 2005 

 

revenues from the financial services segment increased 24 to 2908 million in 2006 from 2351 million in 2005 the increase in financial services revenues was primarily due to the increase in the number of mortgage loans originated and sold partially offset by a slight decrease in the average mortgage revenues earned per loan sold the decline in revenue per loan was largely due to less favorable selling conditions for mortgage originations and the interest rate environment in fiscal 2006 compared to 2005 the majority of the revenues associated with our mortgage operations are recognized when the mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to thirdparty investors 

 

general and administrative ga expenses associated with financial services increased 37 to 2022 million in 2006 from 1476 million in 2005 as a percentage of financial services revenues ga expenses increased by 670 basis points to 695 in 2006 from 628 in 2005 the largest component of our financial services ga expense is employee compensation and related costs which represented 77 and 76 of ga costs in 2006 and 2005 respectively those costs increased 39 to 1554 million in 2006 from 1116 million in 2005 largely due to the addition of employees to support our previously planned growth the increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of financial services revenues reflects the growth of our financial services infrastructure at a faster rate than the growth in revenues because we now do not expect our year over year growth in home closings and the related mortgage loan originations to continue we have adjusted and will continue to adjust our financial services ga infrastructure to support our expected closings volume significant fluctuations in financial services general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues can be expected to occur due to changes in the amount of revenue earned in addition our financial services operations are generally staffed at levels sufficient to support our anticipated seasonal higher mortgage loan volume periods which may vary significantly between periods

the following tables set forth key operating and financial data for our financial services operations for the fiscal years ended september 30 2005 and 2004 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

total firstlien loans originated or brokered by dhi mortgage for our homebuyers increased 23 in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 which was greater than our 17 increase in the number of homes closed because our mortgage capture rate the percentage of total home closings from our homebuilding operations for which dhi mortgage handled the homebuyers’ financing increased to 63 in 2005 from 61 in 2004 home closings from our homebuilding operations constituted 93 of dhi mortgage loan originations in 2005 compared to 92 in 2004 reflecting dhi mortgage’s continued focus on supporting the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations sales of loans to thirdparty investors increased 28 in 2005 as compared to 2004 

 

revenues from the financial services segment increased 29 to 2351 million in 2005 from 1828 million in 2004 the increase in financial services revenues was primarily due to the increase in the number of mortgage loans originated and sold while the average mortgage revenues earned per loan sold remained relatively constant the majority of the revenues associated with our mortgage operations are recognized when the mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to thirdparty investors 

 

ga expenses associated with financial services increased 22 to 1476 million in 2005 from 1210 million in 2004 as a percentage of financial services revenues ga expenses decreased by 340 basis points to 628 in 2005 from 662 in 2004 the largest component of our financial services ga expense is employee compensation and related costs which represented 76 and 73 of ga costs in 2005 and 2004 respectively those costs increased 26 to 1116 million in 2005 from 888 million in 2004 largely due to the addition of employees to support our growth the improvement in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of financial services revenues was due primarily to the more efficient use of our personnel to support the increase in mortgage loan volume significant fluctuations in financial services general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues can be expected to occur due to changes in the amount of revenue earned 

  overview of current capital resources and liquidity 

 

we fund our homebuilding and financial services operations with cash flows from operating activities borrowings under our bank credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities as we utilize our capital resources and liquidity to fund our operations we have focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet 

 

at september 30 2006 our ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital was 407 an increase of 850 basis points from 322 at september 30 2005 net homebuilding debt to total capital consists of homebuilding notes payable net of cash divided by total capital net of cash homebuilding notes payable net of cash plus stockholders’ equity homebuilding notes payable does not include the balance of liabilities if any associated with consolidated land inventory not owned the increase in our ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital at september 30 2006 as compared with the ratio a year earlier was due to the decrease in cash and the increase in borrowings associated with funding our increase in inventory partially offset by the increase in retained earnings our target operating range for net homebuilding debt to total capital is below 45 so the 407 ratio at september 30 2006 is in line with our operating target we remain focused on maintaining our liquidity and strengthening our balance sheet so we can be flexible in reacting to market conditions however future fiscal yearend net homebuilding debt to total capital ratios may be higher than the fiscal 2006 yearend ratio 

 

we believe that the ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital is useful in understanding the leverage employed in our homebuilding operations and comparing us with other homebuilders we exclude the debt of our financial services business because the business is separately capitalized and its debt is substantially collateralized by specified mortgage loans held for sale and its debt is not guaranteed by our parent company or any of our homebuilding entities because of its capital function we include homebuilding cash as a reduction of our homebuilding debt and total capital for comparison at september 30 2006 and 2005 our ratios of homebuilding debt to total capital without netting cash balances were 431 and 406 respectively 

 

we believe that we will be able to continue to fund our homebuilding and financial services operations and our future cash needs including debt maturities through a combination of our existing cash resources cash flows from operations our existing or renewed credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities through the public capital markets 

 

homebuilding capital resources 

 

cash and cash equivalents  — at september 30 2006 our available homebuilding cash and cash equivalents amounted to 4578 million 

 

bank credit facility  — during november 2006 we increased the size of our 215 billion unsecured revolving credit facility which includes a 10 billion letter of credit subfacility to 25 billion and extended its maturity by one year to december 16 2011 the revolving credit facility has an uncommitted 400 million accordion provision which could be used to increase the facility to 29 billion the facility is guaranteed by substantially all of our whollyowned subsidiaries other than our financial services subsidiaries we borrow funds through the revolving credit facility throughout the year to fund working capital requirements and we repay such borrowings with cash generated from our operations and from the issuance of public debt securities 

 

we had 8000 million in cash borrowings outstanding on our homebuilding revolving credit facility at september 30 2006 and no outstanding borrowings on the facility at september 30 2005 under the debt covenants associated with our revolving credit facility when we have fewer than two investment grade senior unsecured debt ratings from moody’s investors service fitch ratings and standard and poor’s corporation our additional homebuilding borrowing capacity under the facility is limited to the lesser of the unused portion of the facility 123 billion at september 30 2006 or an amount determined under a borrowing base arrangement under the borrowing base limitation the sum of our senior debt and the amount drawn on our revolving credit facility may not exceed certain percentages of the various categories of our unencumbered inventory beginning november 7 2005 we had the two required investment grade debt ratings so the 

  borrowing base limitation is not currently in effect on april 5 2006 we received the investment grade rating from the third rating agency 

 

our revolving credit facility also imposes restrictions on our operations and activities including limits on investments cash dividends stock repurchases and incurrence of indebtedness and required maintenance of a maximum leverage ratio a minimum ratio of earnings before interest income taxes depreciation amortization and extraordinary gains and losses to interest incurred and minimum levels of tangible net worth at september 30 2006 we were in compliance with all of the covenants limitations and restrictions that form a part of our bank revolving credit facility and our public debt obligations 

 

repayments of public unsecured debt  — on march 15 2006 we redeemed our 9375 senior notes due 2011 at an aggregate redemption price of approximately 2094 million plus accrued interest concurrent with the redemption we recorded interest expense of approximately 106 million representing the call premium and the unamortized discount and fees related to the redeemed notes 

 

on july 15 2006 we redeemed our 105 senior subordinated notes due 2011 the notes which were originally issued by schuler homes inc and were assumed in the merger in february 2002 were redeemed at an aggregate price of approximately 1524 million plus accrued interest concurrent with the redemption we recorded interest expense of approximately 28 million representing the call premium net of the unamortized premium related to the redeemed notes 

 

recently issued public unsecured debt  — in april 2006 we issued 500 million of 65 senior notes due 2016 and 250 million of 60 senior notes due 2011 we used the proceeds from these offerings for the repayment of borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

 

shelf registration statements  — on june 13 2006 we filed with the securities and exchange commission an automatically effective universal shelf registration statement registering debt and equity securities which we may issue from time to time in amounts to be determined also at september 30 2006 we had the capacity to issue approximately 225 million shares of common stock under our acquisition shelf registration statement to effect in whole or in part possible future business acquisitions 

 

financial services capital resources 

 

cash and cash equivalents  — at september 30 2006 we had available financial services cash and cash equivalents of 1298 million 

 

mortgage warehouse loan facility  — our whollyowned mortgage company has a mortgage warehouse loan facility upon its maturity in april 2006 the loan agreement was amended and restated to extend its maturity date to april 6 2007 this amendment also changed the total capacity of the mortgage warehouse loan facility from 600 million to 670 million until may 1 2006 and then to 540 million thereafter subject to increases upon consent of the lenders to 750 million under the accordion provision of the credit agreement through exercise of the accordion provision in september 2006 the total capacity of the mortgage warehouse loan facility was increased to 750 million from september 22 2006 to november 6 2006 and then to 540 million thereafter at september 30 2006 we had borrowings of 3717 million outstanding under the mortgage warehouse facility 

 

our borrowing capacity under this facility is limited to the lesser of the unused portion of the facility or an amount determined under a borrowing base arrangement under the borrowing base limitation the amount drawn on our mortgage warehouse facility may not exceed 98 of all eligible mortgage loans held for sale and made available to the lenders to secure any borrowings under the facility 

 

commercial paper conduit facility  — our whollyowned mortgage company also has a commercial paper conduit facility the “cp conduit facility” upon its maturity in june 2006 the loan agreement was amended and restated increasing the total capacity of the cp conduit facility from 650 million to 12 billion the new agreement expires june 27 2009 subject to the annual renewal of the 364day backup liquidity feature at september 30 2006 we had borrowings of 8200 million outstanding under the cp conduit facility 

  in the past we have been able to renew or extend the mortgage warehouse loan facility and the cp conduit facility on satisfactory terms prior to their maturities and obtain temporary additional commitments through amendments of the respective credit agreements during periods of higher than normal volumes of mortgages held for sale although we do not anticipate any problems in renewing or extending these facilities or obtaining temporary additional commitments in the future the liquidity of our financial services business depends upon our continued ability to do so 

 

the mortgage warehouse loan facility and the cp conduit facility are not guaranteed by either dr horton inc or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt borrowings under both facilities are secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale additionally at september 30 2006 borrowings under the cp conduit facility were secured by restricted cash arising from borrowings under the facility prior to the assignment of mortgage loans held for sale as collateral the mortgage loans assigned to secure the cp conduit facility are used as collateral for assetbacked commercial paper issued by multiseller conduits in the commercial paper market at september 30 2006 our total mortgage loans held for sale were 10229 million all mortgage company activities are financed with the mortgage warehouse facility the cp conduit facility or internally generated funds both of our financial services credit facilities contain financial covenants as to our mortgage subsidiary’s minimum required tangible net worth its maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and its minimum required net income at september 30 2006 our mortgage subsidiary was in compliance with all of these covenants 

 

operating cash flow activities 

 

during the year ended september 30 2006 we used 12 billion of cash in our operating activities as compared to 6207 million of cash used in such activities during the prior year the net cash used in operations during fiscal 2006 was primarily the result of cash provided from net income and a decrease in mortgage loans held for sale offset by cash used to increase residential land and lot and home inventories the net cash used in operations during fiscal 2005 was the result of cash provided from net income and an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities offset by cash used to increase residential land lot and home inventories mortgage loans held for sale and other assets 

 

the principal reason for the decrease in operating cash flows in fiscal 2006 was our decision to invest 31 billion of cash to fund inventory growth in the period as compared to a 19 billion cash investment for inventory growth in fiscal 2005 the decision to fund additional inventory growth was based on management’s expectations for future returns from the incremental inventory investments in light of the more challenging market conditions encountered in the last six months of fiscal 2006 our expectations have changed so we have substantially slowed our planned purchases of land and lots to reduce our inventory to better match our new reduced rate of production our ability to reduce our inventory levels in the near term is however partially dependent upon our ability to close a sufficient number of homes in the next few quarters to the extent our inventory levels decrease during fiscal 2007 we expect net positive cash flows from operating activities in fiscal 2007 assuming all other factors remain constant 

 

a large portion of our cash invested in inventories represents purchases of land and lots that will be used to generate revenues and cash flows in future years since we control the amounts and timing of our investments in land and lots based on our inventory growth goals and our market opportunities we believe that cash flows from operating activities before increases in residential land and lot inventories is currently a better indicator of our cash flows from operations 

 

another significant factor affecting our operating cash flows in fiscal 2006 was the decrease in mortgage loans held for sale of 3358 million during fiscal 2006 the decrease in mortgage loans held for sale was due to an increase in the volume of loans sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 as a result of more efficient loan sale processes put in place during fiscal 2006 we expect to continue to use cash to fund an increase in mortgage loans held for sale in quarters when our homebuilding closings grow however in periods when home closings are flat or decline as compared to prior periods or if our mortgage capture rate declines the amount of net cash used may be reduced or we may generate positive cash flows from the reduction in the balance of mortgage loans held for sale 

  investing cash flow activities 

 

in fiscal 2006 and 2005 cash used in investing activities represented net purchases of property and equipment primarily model home furniture and office equipment such purchases are not significant relative to our total assets or cash flows and they typically do not vary significantly from year to year 

 

financing cash flow activities 

 

the majority of our shortterm financing needs are funded with cash generated from operations and borrowings available under our homebuilding and financial services credit facilities longterm financing needs are generally funded with the issuance of new senior unsecured debt securities through the public capital markets our homebuilding senior and senior subordinated notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our whollyowned subsidiaries other than our financial services subsidiaries 

 

in march 2006 we redeemed our 9375 senior subordinated notes due 2011 at an aggregate redemption price of approximately 2094 million plus accrued interest concurrent with the redemption we recorded interest expense of approximately 106 million representing the call premium and the unamortized discount and fees related to the redeemed notes 

 

in april 2006 we issued 500 million principal amount of 65 senior notes due 2016 and 250 million principal amount of 60 senior notes due 2011 we used the proceeds from these offerings for the repayment of borrowings under the revolving credit facility 

 

in july 2006 we redeemed our 105 senior subordinated notes due 2011 the notes which were originally issued by schuler homes inc and were assumed in the merger in february 2002 were redeemed at an aggregate price of approximately 1524 million plus accrued interest concurrent with the redemption we recorded interest expense of approximately 28 million representing the call premium net of the unamortized premium related to the redeemed notes 

 

borrowings by our mortgage subsidiary under the cp conduit facility are secured by the assignment of mortgage loans held for sale and restricted cash arising from borrowings under the facility prior to the assignment of the mortgage loans as collateral at september 30 2006 and 2005 the balances of cash restricted for this purpose were 2483 million and 0 respectively 

 

during fiscal 2006 our board of directors declared one quarterly cash dividend of 009 per common share two quarterly cash dividends of 010 per common share and one quarterly cash dividend of 015 per common share the last of which was paid on september 1 2006 to stockholders of record on august 21 2006 on october 12 2006 our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 015 per common share which was paid on november 1 2006 to stockholders of record on october 23 2006 

 

changes in capital structure 

 

in december 2003 our board of directors declared a threefortwo stock split effected as a 50 stock dividend paid on january 12 2004 to holders of record of our common stock as of december 22 2003 in february 2005 our board of directors declared a fourforthree stock split effected as a 33 1  3  stock dividend paid on march 16 2005 to holders of record of our common stock as of march 1 2005 

 

in november 2005 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 500 million of our common stock and up to 200 million of outstanding debt securities replacing the previous common stock and debt securities repurchase authorizations during fiscal 2006 we repurchased one million shares of our common stock at a total cost of 368 million all of which occurred during the three months ended december 31 2005 as of september 30 2006 we had 4632 million remaining of the board of directors’ authorization for repurchases of common stock and 200 million remaining of the authorization for repurchases of debt securities in november 2006 our board of directors renewed the remaining 4632 million common stock repurchase authorization and increased the debt repurchase authorization to 500 million additionally both authorizations were extended to november 30 2007 

  on january 26 2006 our shareholders approved an amendment to the dr horton inc charter which increased the number of authorized shares of common stock to one billion shares 

 

we continue to evaluate our alternatives for future nonoperating uses of our available capital including repayment of debt dividend payments and common stock repurchases based on market conditions and other circumstances and within the constraints of our balance sheet leverage targets and the restrictions gin our bank agreements and indentures 

 

contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments 

 

our primary contractual cash obligations for our homebuilding and financial services segments are payments under shortterm and longterm debt agreements and lease payments under operating leases purchase obligations of our homebuilding segment represent specific performance requirements under lot option purchase agreements that may require us to purchase land contingent upon the land seller meeting certain obligations we expect to fund our contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business through our operating cash flows our homebuilding and financial services credit facilities and by accessing the debt capital markets 

 

our future cash requirements for contractual obligations as of september 30 2006 are presented below 

 

 

 

 

  

at september 30 2006 our homebuilding operations had outstanding letters of credit of 1282 million and surety bonds of 23 billion issued by third parties to secure performance under various contracts we expect that our performance obligations secured by these letters of credit and bonds will generally be completed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms when we complete our performance obligations the related letters of credit and bonds are generally released shortly thereafter leaving us with no continuing obligations we have no material thirdparty guarantees 

 

to meet the financing needs of our customers our mortgage operations extend interest rate lock commitments irlcs to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and meet defined credit and underwriting criteria typically the irlcs have a duration of less than six months some irlcs are committed immediately to a specific investor through the use of bestefforts whole loan delivery commitments while other irlcs are funded prior to being committed to thirdparty investors 

  we manage interest rate risk related to our uncommitted irlcs through the use of forward sales of mortgagebacked securities fmbs and the purchase of eurodollar futures contracts edfc on certain loan types as of september 30 2006 our irlcs totaled 6477 million and we had approximately 3916 million of bestefforts whole loan delivery commitments and 4295 million outstanding of fmbs and edfc related to our uncommitted irlcs 

 

in an effort to stimulate home sales by potentially offering homebuyers a below market interest rate on their home financing we began a program during fiscal 2006 which protects us from future increases in interest rates related to potential mortgage originations of approximately 599 million to accomplish this we purchase forward rate agreements fras and economic interest rate hedges in the form of fmbs and put options on both edfc and mortgagebacked securities mbs at september 30 2006 the notional amount of the fras was 354 million while economic interest rate hedges totaled 24 billion in edfc put options and 104 million in mbs put options hedging a notional principal of 2450 million in mortgage loan commitments both the fras and economic interest rate hedges have various maturities not exceeding twelve months these instruments are considered nondesignated derivatives and are accounted for at fair value with gains and losses recognized in current earnings the gains and losses for the year ended september 30 2006 were not significant 

 

land and lot position and homes in inventory 

 

the following is a summary of our land and lot position and homes in inventory at september 30 2006 and 2005 

 

 

 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts to procure land or lots for the construction of homes lot option contracts enable us to control significant lot positions with a minimal capital investment and substantially reduce the risks associated with land ownership and development at september 30 2006 we owned or controlled approximately 323000 lots 41 of which were lots under option or similar contracts compared with approximately 346000 lots at september 30 2005 

 

at september 30 2006 we controlled approximately 133000 lots with a total remaining purchase price of approximately 40 billion under land and lot option purchase contracts with a total of 2113 million in deposits our lots controlled include approximately 23500 optioned lots with a remaining purchase price of approximately 875 million for which we do not expect to exercise our option to purchase the land or lots but the contract has not yet been terminated we have written off 305 million of deposits and 103 million of preacquisition costs relating to these 23500 lots under contract resulting in a net deposit balance of 1808 million at september 30 2006 during fiscal 2006 including the writeoffs described above we wrote off a total of 1247 million of earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs related to land and lot 

  purchase option contracts for which we do not intend to exercise our option to purchase the land or lots writeoffs of earnest money deposits and preacquisition costs in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 were 171 million and 201 million respectively 

 

within the land and lot option purchase contracts in force at september 30 2006 there were a limited number of contracts representing only 548 million of remaining purchase price subject to specific performance clauses which may require us to purchase the land or lots upon the land sellers meeting their obligations pursuant to the provisions of interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities — an interpretation of arb no 51” as amended fin 46 issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb we consolidated certain variable interest entities with assets of 1004 million related to some of our outstanding land and lot option purchase contracts 

 

at september 30 2006 we had a total of approximately 28500 homes in inventory including approximately 1900 model homes and approximately 440 unsold homes that had been completed for more than six months at september 30 2005 we had a total of approximately 23200 homes in inventory including approximately 1600 model homes and approximately 200 unsold homes that had been completed for more than six months of our total homes in inventory 50 and 41 were unsold at september 30 2006 and 2005 respectively 

 

seasonality 

 

we have typically experienced seasonal variations in our quarterly operating results and capital requirements in prior years we generally had more homes under construction closed more homes and had greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year this seasonal activity increases our working capital requirements for our homebuilding operations during the third and fourth fiscal quarters and increases our funding requirements for the mortgages we originate in our financial services segment at the end of these quarters as a result our results of operations and financial position at the end of the third and fourth fiscal quarters are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year 

 

in fiscal 2006 57 of our consolidated revenues was attributable to operations in the third and fourth fiscal quarters in contrast to our typical seasonal results due to softening homebuilding market conditions during fiscal 2006 only 46 of our consolidated operating income was attributable to operations in the third and fourth fiscal quarters this decrease was primarily due to the increased use of incentives to sell homes and inventory impairment charges and land option cost writeoffs recorded during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2006 we expect that we will experience our historical seasonal patterns of revenues and operating income in future fiscal years 

 

inflation 

 

we and the homebuilding industry in general may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation primarily because of higher land financing labor and material construction costs in addition higher mortgage interest rates can significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers we attempt to pass through to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices and to date inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations however during periods of softer homebuilding market conditions we may not be able to offset the increases in our costs with higher selling prices

critical accounting policies 

 

general  — a comprehensive enumeration of the significant accounting policies of dr horton inc and subsidiaries is presented in note a to the accompanying financial statements as of september 30 2006 and 2005 and for the years ended september 30 2006 2005 and 2004 each of our accounting policies has been chosen based upon current authoritative literature that collectively comprises us generally accepted accounting principles gaap in instances where alternative methods of accounting are permissible under gaap we have chosen the method that most appropriately reflects the nature of our business the results of our operations and our financial condition and have consistently applied those methods over each of the periods presented in the financial statements the audit committee of our board of directors has reviewed and approved the accounting policies selected 

 

basis of presentation  — our financial statements include the accounts of dr horton inc and all of its whollyowned majorityowned and controlled subsidiaries we have also consolidated certain variable interest entities from which we are purchasing lots under option purchase contracts under the requirements of fin 46 all significant intercompany accounts transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation 

 

use of estimates  — the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ materially from those estimates 

 

revenue recognition  — we generally recognize homebuilding revenue and related profit at the time of the closing of a sale when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer in situations where the buyer’s financing is originated by dhi mortgage our whollyowned mortgage subsidiary and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment as prescribed by sfas no 66 the profit on such sales is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a thirdparty investor has been completed we include amounts in transit from title companies at the end of each reporting period in homebuilding cash when we execute sales contracts with our homebuyers or when we require advance payment from homebuyers for custom changes upgrades or options related to their homes we record the cash deposits 

  received as liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are canceled we either retain or refund to the homebuyer deposits on canceled sales contracts depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances 

 

we recognize financial services revenues associated with our title operations as closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued both of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed we transfer substantially all underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies to thirdparty insurers we recognize the majority of the revenues associated with our mortgage operations when the mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to thirdparty investors origination fees and direct origination costs are deferred and recognized as revenues and expenses respectively along with the associated gains and losses on the sales of the loans and related servicing rights when the loans are sold we sell all mortgage loans and related servicing rights to thirdparty investors 

 

some of the loans sold by dhi mortgage are sold with limited recourse provisions based on historical experience we estimate and record an allowance for losses related to loans sold with recourse 

 

inventories and cost of sales  — inventory includes the costs of direct land acquisition land development and home construction capitalized interest real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and home construction applicable direct overhead costs that we incur after development projects or homes are substantially complete such as utilities maintenance and cleaning are charged to sga expense as incurred all indirect overhead costs such as compensation of construction superintendents sales personnel and division and region management advertising and builder’s risk insurance are charged to sga expense as incurred 

 

land and development costs are typically allocated to individual residential lots on a prorata basis and the costs of residential lots are transferred to construction in progress when home construction begins home construction costs are accumulated for each specific home 

 

we use the specific identification method for the purpose of accumulating home construction costs cost of sales for homes closed includes the specific construction costs of each home and all applicable land acquisition land development and related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each project any changes to the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial home closings in a project are generally allocated on a prorata basis to the remaining homes in the project 

 

when a home is closed we generally have not yet paid and recorded all incurred costs necessary to complete the home each month we record as a liability and as a charge to cost of sales the amount we determine will ultimately be paid related to completed homes that have been closed as of the end of that month we compare our home construction budgets to actual recorded costs to determine the additional costs remaining to be paid on each closed home we monitor the accuracy of each month’s accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on closed homes in subsequent months to the amount we accrued although actual costs to be paid in the future on previously closed homes could differ from our current accruals historically differences in amounts have not been significant 

 

in accordance with sfas no 144 land inventory and related communities under development are reviewed for potential writedowns when impairment indicators are present sfas no 144 requires that in the event the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts impairment charges are required to be recorded if the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying amounts these estimates of cash flows are significantly impacted by estimates of revenues costs and other factors due to uncertainties in the estimation process actual results could differ from such estimates for those assets deemed to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets our determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams 

 

in accordance with sfas no 144 valuation adjustments are recorded on finished homes when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value is less than the fair value less costs to sell the home 

  consolidated land inventory not owned  — we account for our land and lot option purchase contracts in accordance with the provisions of fin 46 fin 46 provides guidance for the financial accounting and reporting of interests in certain variable interest entities which fin 46 defines as certain business entities that either have equity investors with no voting rights or have equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entities to support their activities fin 46 requires consolidation of such entities by any company that is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the entities’ activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entities’ residual returns or both defined as the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity 

 

in the ordinary course of our homebuilding business we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts to procure land or lots for the construction of homes under such option purchase contracts we will fund a stated deposit in consideration for the right but not the obligation to purchase land or lots at a future point in time with predetermined terms under the terms of the option purchase contracts many of our option deposits are not refundable at our discretion under the requirements of fin 46 certain of the option purchase contracts result in the creation of a variable interest in the entity holding the land parcel under option 

 

in applying the provisions of fin 46 we evaluate those land and lot option purchase contracts with variable interest entities to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary based upon analysis of the variability of the expected gains and losses of the entity based on this evaluation if we are the primary beneficiary of an entity with which we have entered into a land or lot option purchase contract the variable interest entity is consolidated 

 

since we own no equity interest in any of the unaffiliated variable interest entities that we must consolidate pursuant to fin 46 we generally have little or no control or influence over the operations of these entities or their owners when our requests for financial information are denied by the land sellers certain assumptions about the assets and liabilities of such entities are required in most cases the fair value of the assets of the consolidated entities has been assumed to be the remaining contractual purchase price of the land or lots we are purchasing in these cases it is assumed that the entities have no debt obligations and the only asset recorded is the land or lots we have the option to buy with a related offset to minority interest for the assumed third party investment in the variable interest entity creditors if any of these variable interest entities have no recourse against us 

 

warranty costs  — we have established warranty reserves by charging cost of sales and crediting a warranty liability for each home closed we estimate the amounts charged to be adequate to cover expected warrantyrelated costs for materials and labor required under one and tenyear warranty obligation periods the oneyear warranty is comprehensive for all parts and labor the tenyear period is for major construction defects our warranty cost accruals are based upon our historical warranty cost experience in each market in which we operate and are adjusted as appropriate to reflect qualitative risks associated with the type of homes we build and the geographic areas in which we build them actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts a 10 change in the historical warranty rates used to estimate our warranty accrual would not result in a material change in our accrual 

 

insurance claim costs  — we have and require the majority of the subcontractors we use to have general liability insurance including construction defect coverage and workers compensation insurance these insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims subject to certain selfinsured retentions deductibles and other coverage limits in some states where we believe it is too difficult or expensive for the subcontractors to obtain general liability insurance we have waived our traditional subcontractor general liability insurance requirements to obtain lower bids from subcontractors we selfinsure a portion of our overall risk partially through the use of a captive insurance entity which issues a general liability policy to us naming some subcontractors as additional insureds 

 

we record expenses and liabilities related to the costs to cover our selfinsured and deductible amounts under our insurance policies and for any estimated costs of potential claims and lawsuits including expected legal costs in excess of our coverage limits or not covered by our policies based on an analysis of our historical claims which includes an estimate of construction defect claims incurred but not yet reported projection of losses related to these liabilities is subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties 

  such as trends in construction defect claims relative to our markets and the types of products we build claim settlement patterns insurance industry practices and legal interpretations among others because of the high degree of judgment required in determining these estimated liability amounts actual future costs could differ significantly from our currently estimated amounts a 10 change in the claim rate or the average cost per claim used to estimate the selfinsured accruals would not result in a material change in our accrual 

 

goodwill  — goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over net assets acquired pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” we review goodwill for potential impairment annually or when events and circumstances warrant an earlier review impairment is determined to exist when the estimated fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value during fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 we measured the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model and determined that the fair value of our reporting units was greater than their book value and therefore no impairment of goodwill existed 

 

we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining balance of goodwill may not be recoverable the goodwill assessment procedures required by sfas no 142 require management to make comprehensive estimates of future revenues and costs due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates actual results could differ from such estimates continued softness in the homebuilding industry may result in the determination that some of our goodwill has become impaired which would result in a potentially significant charge to reflect goodwill impairment 

 

income taxes  — we calculate a provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes in determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns judgment is required differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 

 

stockbased compensation  — with the approval of our compensation committee consisting of independent members of our board of directors we from time to time issue to employees and directors options to purchase our common stock the committee approves grants only out of amounts remaining available for grant from amounts formally authorized by our common stockholders we typically grant approved options with exercise prices equal to the market price of our common stock on the date of the option grant the majority of the options granted vest ratably over a tenyear period 

 

on october 1 2005 we adopted the provisions of sfas no 123r “share based payment” which requires that companies measure and recognize compensation expense at an amount equal to the fair value of sharebased payments granted under compensation arrangements we calculate the fair value of stock options using the blackscholes option pricing model determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions which involve a number of variables these variables include but are not limited to the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards the expected dividend yield and expected stock option exercise behavior in addition we also use judgment in estimating the number of sharebased awards that are expected to be forfeited 

 

prior to october 1 2005 we accounted for stock option grants using the intrinsic value method in accordance with the accounting principles board apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and recognized no compensation expense for stock option grants since all options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 

 

recent accounting pronouncements 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” the statement defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas no 157 is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s fiscal year that begins after november 15 2007 we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of sfas no 157 however it is 

  not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

in september 2006 the securities and exchange commission sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 108 “considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements” which addresses how the effects of prioryear uncorrected financial statement misstatements should be considered in currentyear financial statements the sab requires registrants to quantify misstatements using both balancesheet and incomestatement approaches and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relative quantitative and qualitative factors the requirements of sab no 108 are effective for annual financial statements covering the first fiscal year ending after november 15 2006 we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of sab no 108 however it is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

in july 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 fin 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement 109” fin 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for recognizing measuring presenting and disclosing in the financial statements tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return including a decision whether to file or not to file in a particular jurisdiction fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of fin 48 however it is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

in march 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 156 “accounting for servicing of financial assets — an amendment of fasb statement no 140” which provides an approach to simplify efforts to obtain hedgelike offset accounting by allowing a company the option to carry mortgage servicing rights at fair value this new statement amends sfas no 140 “accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities — a replacement of fasb statement no 125” with respect to the accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities sfas no 156 is effective for all separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities as of the beginning of an entity’s fiscal year that begins after september 15 2006 with earlier adoption permitted in certain circumstances since we do not retain the servicing rights when we sell our mortgage loans held for sale the adoption of sfas no 156 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

in may 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 “accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 20 and fasb statement no 3” this statement changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle and requires retrospective application of changes in accounting principle to prior periods’ financial statements unless it is impracticable to determine the periodspecific effects or the cumulative effect of the change sfas no 154 is effective for us for accounting changes and corrections of errors made after october 1 2006 the beginning of our fiscal year 2007 the adoption of sfas no 154 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

we are subject to interest rate risk on our longterm debt we monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and utilize both fixed and variable rate debt for fixed rate debt changes in interest rates generally affect the value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows conversely for variable rate debt changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument but may affect our future earnings and cash flows we have mitigated our exposure to changes in interest rates on our variable rate bank debt by entering into interest rate swap agreements to obtain a fixed interest rate for a portion of the variable rate borrowings we generally do not have an obligation to prepay fixedrate debt prior to maturity and as a result interest rate risk and changes in fair value would not have a significant impact on our cash flows related to our fixedrate debt until such time as we are required to refinance repurchase or repay such debt 

  our interest rate swaps are not designated as hedges under sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with changes in the fair values of the swaps and such changes must be reflected in our income statements 

 

our mortgage company is exposed to interest rate risk associated with its mortgage loan origination services interest rate lock commitments irlcs are extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and who meet defined credit and underwriting criteria typically the irlcs have a duration of less than six months some irlcs are committed immediately to a specific investor through the use of bestefforts whole loan delivery commitments while other irlcs are funded prior to being committed to thirdparty investors we manage interest rate risk related to uncommitted irlcs through the use of forward sales of mortgagebacked securities fmbs and the purchase of eurodollar futures contracts edfc on certain loan types fmbs and edfc related to irlcs are classified and accounted for as nondesignated derivative instruments with gains and losses recognized in current earnings fmbs and edfc related to funded uncommitted loans are designated as fair value hedges with changes in the value of the derivative instruments recognized in current earnings along with changes in the value of the funded uncommitted loans the effectiveness of the fair value hedges is continuously monitored and any ineffectiveness which for the years ended september 30 2006 2005 and 2004 was not significant is recognized in current earnings at september 30 2006 fmbs and edfc to mitigate interest rate risk related to uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale and uncommitted irlcs totaled 10075 million uncommitted irlcs the duration of which are generally less than six months totaled approximately 2561 million and uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale totaled approximately 3685 million at september 30 2006 the fair value of the fmbs edfc and irlcs at september 30 2006 was an insignificant amount 

 

in an effort to stimulate home sales by potentially offering homebuyers a below market interest rate on their home financing we began a program during fiscal 2006 which protects us from future increases in interest rates related to potential mortgage originations of approximately 599 million to accomplish this we purchase forward rate agreements fras and economic interest rate hedges in the form of fmbs and put options on both edfc and mortgagebacked securities mbs at september 30 2006 the notional amount of the fras was 354 million while economic interest rate hedges totaled 24 billion in edfc put options and 104 million in mbs put options hedging a notional principal of 245 million in mortgage loan commitments both the fras and economic interest rate hedges have various maturities not exceeding twelve months these instruments are considered nondesignated derivatives and are accounted for at fair value with gains and losses recognized in current earnings the gains and losses for the year ended september 30 2006 were not significant 

 

the following table sets forth principal cash flows by expected maturity weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value of our debt obligations as of september 30 2006 in addition the table sets forth the notional amounts weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value of our interest rate swaps because the mortgage warehouse credit facility and cp conduit facility are secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale which are typically sold within 60 days the outstanding balances at september 30 2006 are included in the variable rate maturities for the fiscal year ending september 30 2007 at september 30 2006 the fair value of the interest rate swaps was a 01 million liability

 item 1 business tableend   dr horton inc is the largest homebuilding company in the united states based on our domestic homes closed during the twelve months ended september 30 2005 we construct and sell high quality singlefamily homes through our operating divisions in 25 states and 74 metropolitan markets of the united states primarily under the name of dr horton america’s builder dr horton inc is a fortune 500 company and our common stock is included in the sp 500 index and listed on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol “dhi” unless the context otherwise requires the terms “dr horton” the “company” “we” and “our” used herein refer to dr horton inc a delaware corporation and its predecessors and subsidiaries 

  donald r horton began our homebuilding business in 1978 in 1991 we were incorporated in delaware to acquire the assets and businesses of our predecessor companies which were residential home construction and development companies owned or controlled by mr horton in 1992 we completed our initial public offering of our common stock from inception we have consistently grown the size of our company by investing our available capital into our existing homebuilding markets and into startup operations in new markets additionally we have acquired numerous other homebuilding companies the most recent of which was in 2002 which have strengthened our market position in existing markets and expanded our geographic presence and product offerings in other markets the success of our organic growth strategies and our effective acquisition strategy has enabled us to become the largest homebuilding company in the united states a distinction we have maintained for our last four fiscal years our homes generally range in size from 1000 to 5000 square feet and range in price from 90000 to 900000 for the year ended september 30 2005 we closed 51172 homes with an average closing sales price approximating 261400 

  through our financial services operations we provide mortgage banking and title agency services to homebuyers in many of our homebuilding markets dhi mortgage our whollyowned subsidiary provides mortgage financing services principally to purchasers of homes we build and sell our subsidiary title companies serve as title insurance agents by providing title insurance policies examination and closing services primarily to purchasers of homes we build and sell 

  our financial reporting segments consist of homebuilding and financial services our homebuilding operations are by far the most substantial part of our business comprising approximately 98 of consolidated revenues and approximately 96 of consolidated income before income taxes in fiscal year 2005 during fiscal 2005 our total consolidated revenues were 138637 million and our total consolidated income before income taxes was 23786 million our homebuilding segment generates the majority of its revenues from the sale of completed homes with a lesser amount from the sale of land and lots in addition to building traditional singlefamily detached homes the homebuilding segment also builds attached homes such as town homes duplexes triplexes and condominiums including some midrise buildings which share common walls and roofs the sale of detached homes generated approximately 83 84 and 91 of home sales revenues in fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively our financial services segment generates its revenues from originating and selling mortgages and collecting fees for title insurance and closing services financial information including revenue pretax income and identifiable assets for both of our reporting segments is included in our consolidated financial statements

operating strategy 

  our overall operating strategy is to take advantage of opportunities to grow our homebuilding business profitably through capturing greater market share while continuing to maintain a strong balance sheet we plan to execute our growth strategy primarily by investing our available capital in our existing homebuilding markets through our capital allocation process and by entering satellite markets as opportunities are available however we will also evaluate homebuilding acquisition opportunities as they arise 

  we believe that the following specific operating strategies have enabled us to achieve consistent growth and profitability in the past and will continue to contribute to our future growth and profitability goals 

   from 1978 to late 1987 our homebuilding activities were conducted in the dallas fort worth area we then began diversifying geographically by entering additional markets both through startup operations and acquisitions we now operate in 25 states and 74 markets this provides us with geographic diversification in our homebuilding inventory investments and our sources of revenues and earnings 

  we believe our diversification strategy mitigates the effects of local and regional economic cycles and enhances our growth potential typically we do not invest material amounts of capital in real estate including raw land developed lots models and speculative homes or overhead in startup operations in new markets until such markets demonstrate significant growth potential and acceptance of our products while we believe there are significant growth opportunities in our existing markets we also intend to continue our diversification strategy by seeking to enter new markets primarily through the opening of satellite operations in smaller markets near our existing operating divisions we also continue to evaluate opportunities to enter new markets or strengthen our presence in our existing markets through acquisitions of other homebuilding companies we continually monitor the sales margins and returns achieved in each of our markets as part of our evaluation of the use of our capital 

   we are the largest homebuilding company in the united states in terms of number of homes closed in fiscal 2005 we are also the largest or one of the five largest builders in many of our markets by the same measure in fiscal 2005 we believe that our national regional and local scale of operations has provided us with benefits that may not be available in the same degree to some other smaller homebuilders such as 

   our economies of scale have contributed to significant improvements in our homebuilding operating margins our operating margins provide us with operational flexibility to compete for additional market share in each of our markets and in new satellite markets versus our competitors that have lower operating margins 

   we decentralize our homebuilding activities to give more operating flexibility to our local division presidents at september 30 2005 we had 43 separate homebuilding operating divisions some of which are in the same market area and some of which operate in more than one market area generally each operating division consists of a division president land entitlement acquisition and development personnel a sales manager and sales personnel a construction manager and construction superintendents customer service personnel a controller a purchasing manager and office staff we believe that division presidents and their management teams who are familiar with local conditions have better information on which to base decisions regarding local operations our division presidents receive performance bonuses based upon achieving targeted financial and operational measures in their operating divisions 

   each operating division is responsible for 

   — a feasibility study 

  — soil and environmental reviews 

  — review of existing zoning and other governmental requirements and 

  — review of the need for and extent of offsite work required to meet local building codes 

 

   we centralize the key risk elements of our homebuilding business through our regional and corporate offices we have eight separate homebuilding regional offices some of these oversee operations in only one of our geographic reporting regions and others oversee operations in more than one geographic reporting region generally each regional office consists of a region president legal counsel a chief financial officer a purchasing manager and limited office support staff each of our region presidents and their management teams are responsible for oversight of the operations of up to nine homebuilding operating divisions including 

   our corporate executives and corporate office departments are responsible for establishing our operational policies and internal control standards and for monitoring compliance with established policies 

3 and controls throughout our operations the corporate office also has primary responsibility for direct management of certain key risk elements and initiatives through the following centralized functions 

 

   we control our overhead costs by centralizing certain administrative and accounting functions and by closely monitoring the number of administrative personnel and management positions in our operating divisions regions and corporate office we also minimize advertising costs by participating in promotional activities sponsored by local real estate brokers and trade associations 

  we control construction costs by striving to design our homes efficiently and by obtaining competitive bids for construction materials and labor we also negotiate favorable pricing from our primary subcontractors and suppliers based on the volume of services and products we purchase from them on a local regional and national basis we monitor our construction costs on each house through our purchasing and construction budgeting systems and we monitor our inventory levels margins returns and expenses through our management information systems 

   we have recently focused on internal growth and strengthening our balance sheet however as an integral component of our operational strategy we also evaluate opportunities for strategic acquisitions we believe that in some instances expanding our operations through the acquisition of existing homebuilding companies can provide us benefits not found in startup operations such as 

 4   in evaluating potential acquisition candidates we seek homebuilding companies that have excellent reputations track records of profitability and strong management teams we seek to limit the risks associated with acquiring such companies by conducting extensive operational financial and legal due diligence on each acquisition and by only acquiring homebuilding companies that we believe will have a positive impact on our earnings within an acceptable period of time we believe that our acquisition evaluation and due diligence processes combined with our decentralized operating approach with centralized controls have contributed to the successful integration of our prior acquisitions 

markets 

  we conduct our homebuilding operations in all of the geographic regions states and markets listed below and we conduct our mortgage and title operations in many of these markets as indicated below new markets entered in fiscal 2005 are denoted by an asterisk  

 5   when evaluating new or existing homebuilding markets we consider the following local marketspecific factors among others 

   the major part of our homebuilding operations is in six states the following were the percentages of our total homebuilding inventory in those states 

   our homebuilding revenues from home sales by geographic region were 

   for a discussion of net sales orders and homes closed for the years ended september 30 2005 2004 and 2003 and sales order backlog as of september 30 2005 2004 and 2003 please see “management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition — results of operations — homebuilding” 

6   our homebuilding revenues from land and lot sales by geographic region were 

 land policies 

  typically we acquire land only after we have completed appropriate due diligence and after we have obtained the rights “entitlements” to begin development or construction work resulting in an acceptable number of residential lots before we acquire lots or tracts of land we will among other things complete a feasibility study which includes soil tests independent environmental studies and other engineering work and evaluate the status of necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements required to develop and use the property for home construction although we purchase and develop land primarily to support our homebuilding activities we also sell lots and land to other developers and homebuilders 

  we also enter into landlot option contracts in which we obtain the right but generally not the obligation to buy land or lots at predetermined prices on a defined schedule commensurate with anticipated home closings or planned land development our option contracts generally are nonrecourse which limits our financial exposure to our earnest money deposited with land and lot sellers this enables us to control significant land and lot positions with minimal capital investment which substantially reduces the risks associated with land ownership and development 

  almost all of our land positions are acquired directly by us we typically avoid entering into joint venture arrangements due to their increased costs and complexity as well as the loss of operational control inherent in such arrangements we are a party to a very small number of joint ventures that were acquired through acquisitions of other homebuilders all of these joint ventures are consolidated in our financial statements 

  we limit our exposure to real estate inventory risks by 

 7 construction 

  our home designs are selected or prepared in each of our markets to appeal to local tastes and preferences of homebuyers in each community we also offer optional interior and exterior features to allow homebuyers to enhance the basic home design and to allow us to generate additional revenues from each home sold 

  substantially all of our construction work is performed by subcontractors subcontractors typically are retained for a specific subdivision pursuant to a contract that obligates the subcontractor to complete construction at an agreedupon price agreements with our subcontractors and suppliers generally are negotiated for each subdivision we compete with other homebuilders for qualified subcontractors raw materials and lots in the markets where we operate we employ construction superintendents to monitor homes under construction participate in major design and building decisions coordinate the activities of subcontractors and suppliers review the work of subcontractors for quality and cost controls and monitor compliance with zoning and building codes in addition our construction superintendents play a significant role in working with our homebuyers by assisting with option selection and home modification decisions educating buyers on the construction process and instructing buyers on postclosing home maintenance 

  construction time for our homes depends on the weather availability of labor materials and supplies size of the home and other factors we typically complete the construction of a home within four to six months 

  we typically do not maintain significant inventories of construction materials except for work in progress materials for homes under construction typically the construction materials used in our operations are readily available from numerous sources we have contracts exceeding one year with certain suppliers of our building materials that are cancelable at our option with a 30 day notice in recent years we have not experienced delays in construction due to shortages of materials or labor that have materially affected our consolidated operating results 

marketing and sales 

  we market and sell our homes through commissioned employees and independent real estate brokers we typically conduct home sales from sales offices located in furnished model homes in each subdivision and we typically do not offer our model homes for sale until the completion of a subdivision our sales personnel assist prospective homebuyers by providing them with floor plans price information tours of model homes and assisting them with the selection of options and other custom features we train and inform our sales personnel as to the availability of financing construction schedules and marketing and advertising plans as market conditions warrant we may provide potential homebuyers with one or more of a variety of incentives including discounts and free upgrades to be competitive in a particular market 

  we advertise in our local markets as necessary we advertise in newspapers and real estate trade publications as well as with marketing brochures and newsletters we also use billboards radio and television advertising and our internet website to market the location price range and availability of our homes to minimize advertising costs we attempt to operate in subdivisions in conspicuous locations that permit us to take advantage of local traffic patterns we also believe that model homes play a substantial role in our marketing efforts so we expend significant effort to create an attractive atmosphere in our model homes 

  in addition to using model homes in certain markets we build a limited number of speculative homes in each subdivision these homes enhance our marketing and sales efforts to prospective homebuyers who are relocating to these markets as well as to independent brokers who often represent homebuyers requiring a completed home within 60 days we determine our speculative homes strategy in each market based on local market factors such as new job growth the number of job relocations housing demand seasonality and our past experience in the market we determine the number of speculative homes to build in each subdivision based on our current and planned sales pace and we seek to monitor and adjust 

8 speculative homes inventory on an ongoing basis as conditions warrant we typically sell a substantial majority of our speculative homes while they are under construction or immediately following completion 

  our sales contracts require an earnest money deposit of at least 500 the amount of earnest money required varies between markets and subdivisions and may significantly exceed 500 additionally customers are generally required to pay additional deposits when they select options or upgrade features for their homes most of our sales contracts stipulate that when customers cancel their contracts with us we have the right to retain their earnest money and option deposits however our operating divisions occasionally choose to refund such deposits our sales contracts also include a financing contingency which permits customers to cancel and receive a refund of their deposits if they cannot obtain mortgage financing at prevailing or specified interest rates within a specified period our contracts may include other contingencies such as the sale of an existing home depending upon market conditions the sales contracts used in certain subdivisions may also contain restrictions aimed at limiting purchases of our homes by speculative investors who plan to purchase our homes and then quickly place the homes up for resale as a percentage of gross sales orders cancellations of sales contracts have generally ranged from 16 to 20 over the past five years the length of time between the signing of a sales contract for a home and delivery of the home to the buyer closing averages between three and six months 

customer service and quality control 

  our operating divisions are responsible for preclosing quality control inspections and responding to customers’ postclosing needs we believe that prompt and courteous response to homebuyers’ needs during and after construction reduces postclosing repair costs enhances our reputation for quality and service and ultimately leads to significant repeat and referral business from the real estate community and homebuyers we provide our homebuyers with a limited oneyear warranty on workmanship and building materials the subcontractors who perform the actual construction also provide us with warranties on workmanship and are generally prepared to respond to us and the homeowner promptly upon request in addition we typically provide a supplemental tenyear limited warranty that covers major construction defects and some of our suppliers provide manufacturer’s warranties on specified products installed in the home 

customer mortgage financing 

  we provide mortgage financing services principally to purchasers of our homes in the majority of our homebuilding markets through our whollyowned subsidiary dhi mortgage dhi mortgage coordinates and expedites the entire sales transaction for both our homebuyers and our homebuilding operations by ensuring that mortgage commitments are received and that closings take place in a timely and efficient manner dhi mortgage originates mortgage loans for a substantial portion of our homebuyers and when necessary to fulfill the needs of some homebuyers also brokers loans to thirdparty lenders who directly originate the mortgage loans during the year ended september 30 2005 approximately 93 of dhi mortgage’s loan volume related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations and dhi mortgage provided mortgage financing services for approximately 63 of our total homes closed 

  for loans that it originates dhi mortgage packages and sells the loans and their servicing rights to thirdparty investors shortly after origination on a nonrecourse or limited recourse basis in markets where we currently do not provide mortgage financing we work with a variety of mortgage lenders that make available to homebuyers a range of mortgage financing programs 

title services 

  we serve as a title insurance agent in selected markets by providing title insurance policies examination and closing services to purchasers of homes we build and sell through our subsidiary title companies we currently assume little or no underwriting risk associated with these title policies 

9 employees 

  at september 30 2005 we employed 8900 persons of whom 1540 were sales and marketing personnel 2919 were executive administrative and clerical personnel 2845 were involved in construction and 1596 worked in mortgage and title operations we had fewer than 20 employees covered by collective bargaining agreements employees of some of the subcontractors which we use are represented by labor unions or are subject to collective bargaining agreements we believe that our relations with our employees and subcontractors are good 

competition 

  the homebuilding industry is highly competitive we compete in each of our markets with numerous other national regional and local homebuilders for homebuyers desirable properties raw materials skilled labor and financing our homes compete on the basis of quality price design mortgage financing terms and location our financial services business competes with other mortgage lenders including national regional and local mortgage bankers savings and loan associations and other financial institutions some of which have greater access to capital markets and different lending criteria 

governmental regulation and environmental matters 

  the homebuilding industry is subject to extensive and complex regulations we and our subcontractors must comply with various federal state and local laws and regulations including zoning density and development requirements building environmental advertising and real estate sales rules and regulations these requirements affect the development process as well as building materials to be used building designs and minimum elevation of properties our homes are inspected by local authorities where required and homes eligible for insurance or guarantees provided by the fha and va are subject to inspection by them these regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities in addition our new housing developments may be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets and other public improvements 

  our homebuilding operations are also subject to a variety of local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning protection of health safety and the environment the particular environmental laws for each site vary greatly according to location environmental condition and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties 

  our mortgage company and title insurance agencies must also comply with various federal and state laws and regulations these include eligibility and other requirements for participation in the programs offered by the fha va gnma fannie mae and freddie mac these also include required compliance with consumer lending and other laws and regulations such as disclosure requirements prohibitions against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures all of these laws and regulations may subject our operations to examination by the applicable agencies 

seasonality 

  we experience seasonal variations in our quarterly operating results and capital requirements historically more of our sales contracts have been made during the spring and summer months than in the balance of the year as a result we typically have more homes under construction close more homes and have greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year

 item 1a risk factors tableend   discussion of our business and operations included in this annual report on form 10k should be read together with the risk factors set forth below they describe various risks and uncertainties to which we are or may become subject these risks and uncertainties together with other factors described elsewhere in this report have the potential to affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner 

   cyclical industry the homebuilding industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions such as 

   these may occur on a national scale or may affect some of the regions or markets in which we operate more than others if adverse conditions affect any of our larger markets they could have a proportionately greater impact on us than some other homebuilding companies 

  an oversupply of alternatives to new homes such as rental properties and used or foreclosed homes could also depress new home prices and reduce our margins on the sales of new homes 

  risks related to national security continued military deployments in the middle east and other overseas regions terrorist attacks other acts of violence or threats to national security and any corresponding response by the united states or others or related domestic or international instability may adversely affect general economic conditions or cause a slowdown of the national economy 

  inventory risks inventory risks can be substantial for our homebuilding business our longterm ability to build homes depends upon our acquiring land suitable for residential building at affordable prices in locations where our customers want to live we must anticipate demand for new homes and continuously seek and make acquisitions of land for replacement and expansion of land inventory within our current markets and for expansion into new markets in some markets this has become more difficult and costly 

  our current goal is to own or control approximately a three to four year supply of land and building lots the risks inherent in controlling or purchasing and developing land increase as consumer demand for housing decreases thus we may have acquired options on or bought and developed land at a cost we will not be able to recover fully or on which we cannot build and sell homes profitably our deposits for building lots controlled under option or similar contracts may be put at risk the market value of undeveloped land building lots and housing inventories can also fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions we cannot make any assurances that the measures we employ to manage inventory risks and costs will be successful 

  in addition inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in reduced margins or losses in a poorly performing project or market in the event of significant changes in economic or market conditions we may have to sell homes or land for a lower profit margin or at a loss 

  supply risks the homebuilding industry has from time to time experienced significant difficulties that can affect the cost or timing of construction including 

 11   risks from nature weather conditions and natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes volcanic activity droughts floods and wildfires can harm our homebuilding business these can delay home closings adversely affect the cost or availability of materials or labor or damage homes under construction the climates and geology of many of the states in which we operate including california florida and texas where we have some of our larger operations present increased risks of adverse weather or natural disaster 

  possible consequences as a result of the foregoing matters in the future potential customers may be less willing or able to buy our homes or we may take longer or incur more costs to build them we may not be able to recapture increased costs by raising prices in many cases because of market conditions or because we fix our prices in advance of delivery by signing home sales contracts we may be unable to change the mix of our home offerings or the affordability of our homes to maintain our margins or satisfactorily address changing market conditions in other ways in addition cancellations of home sales contracts in backlog may increase beyond historical rates as homebuyers cancel or do not honor their contracts 

  our financial services business is closely related to our homebuilding business as it originates mortgage loans principally to purchasers of the homes we build a decrease in the demand for our homes because of the foregoing matters or an increase in consumer preference for adjustable rate or other lowmargin loans could also adversely affect the financial results of this segment of our business an increase in the default rate on the mortgages we originate could adversely affect the pricing we receive upon the sale of mortgages that we originate in the future 

   most of our customers finance their home purchases through lenders providing mortgage financing interest rates have been at historical lows for a significant time many homebuyers have also chosen adjustable rate interest only or other mortgages that involve initial lower monthly payments as a result new homes have been more affordable increases in interest rates or decreases in availability of mortgage financing however could reduce the market for new homes potential homebuyers may be less willing or able to pay the increased monthly costs or to obtain mortgage financing that exposes them to interest rate changes lenders may increase the qualifications needed for mortgages or adjust their terms to address any increased credit risk even if potential customers do not need financing changes in interest rates and mortgage availability could make it harder for them to sell their current homes to potential buyers who need financing these matters could adversely affect the sales or pricing of our homes and could also reduce the volume or margins in our financial services business the impact on our financial services business could be compounded to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate through the various hedging strategies we employ 

  in addition we believe that the availability of fha and va mortgage financing is an important factor in marketing some of our homes we also believe that the liquidity provided by fannie mae and freddie mac to the mortgage industry is important to the housing market however the federal government has recently sought to reduce the size of the homeloan portfolios and operations of these two governmentsponsored enterprises any limitations or restrictions on the availability of the financing or on the liquidity by them could adversely affect interest rates mortgage financing and our sales of new homes and mortgage loans 

  significant expenses of owning a home including mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes generally are deductible expenses for an individual’s federal and in some cases state income taxes subject to various limitations under current tax law and policy if the federal government or a state government changes its income tax laws as has been discussed recently to eliminate or substantially modify these income tax deductions the aftertax cost of owning a new home could increase for many of our potential 

12 customers the resulting loss or reduction of homeowner tax deductions if such tax law changes were enacted without offsetting provisions could adversely impact demand for and sales prices of new homes 

   we are subject to extensive and complex regulations that affect land development and home construction including zoning density restrictions building design and building standards these regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities as to the conditions we must meet prior to being approved if approved at all we are subject to determinations by these authorities as to the adequacy of water or sewage facilities roads or other local services in addition in many markets government authorities have implemented no growth or growth control initiatives any of these can limit delay or increase the costs of development or homebuilding 

  new housing developments may be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets and other public improvements these can cause an increase in the effective prices for our homes in addition increases in property tax rates by local governmental authorities as recently experienced in response to reduced federal and state funding can adversely affect the ability of potential customers to obtain financing or their desire to purchase new homes 

  we also are subject to a variety of local state and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of health safety and the environment the impact of environmental laws varies depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available these matters may result in delays may cause us to incur substantial compliance remediation and other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas 

  our financial services operations are also subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations these include eligibility requirements for participation in federal loan programs and compliance with consumer lending and similar requirements such as disclosure requirements prohibitions against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures they may also subject our operations to examination by the applicable agencies these may limit our ability to provide mortgage financing or title services to potential purchasers of our homes 

   we have a significant amount of debt as of september 30 2005 our consolidated debt was 49096 million in the ordinary course of business we may incur significant additional debt to the extent permitted by our revolving credit facility and our indentures 

  possible consequences the amount of our debt could have important consequences for example it could 

 13   dependence on future performance our ability to meet our debt service and other obligations will depend upon our future financial performance we are engaged in businesses that are substantially affected by changes in economic conditions our revenues and earnings vary with the level of general economic activity in the markets we serve our businesses are also affected by financial political business and other factors many of which are beyond our control the factors that affect our ability to generate cash can also affect our ability to raise additional funds for these purposes through the sale of debt or equity securities the refinancing of debt or the sale of assets changes in prevailing interest rates may affect our ability to meet our debt service obligations because borrowings under our credit facilities bear interest at floating rates and our “interest rate swap” agreements fix our interest rate for only a portion of these borrowings 

  as of september 30 2005 the scheduled maturities of principal on our outstanding debt for the subsequent 12 months totaled 12705 million including 12495 million in financial services debt that must be renewed annually based on the current level of operations we believe our cash flow from operations available cash available borrowings under our credit facilities and our ability to access the capital markets and to refinance or renew our facilities in a timely manner will be adequate to meet our future cash needs we cannot however make any assurances that in the future our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that borrowings or access to the capital markets or refinancing or renewal facilities will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay or refinance our indebtedness or to fund other cash needs 

  indenture and credit facility restrictions our revolving credit facility and the indentures governing most series of our senior and senior subordinated notes impose restrictions on our operations and activities the most significant restrictions relate to limits on investments stock repurchases cash dividends and other restricted payments incurrence of indebtedness creation of liens and asset dispositions and require maintenance of minimum levels of tangible net worth and compliance with other financial covenants if we fail to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants the trustees the noteholders or the lending banks as applicable could cause our debt to become due and payable prior to maturity if we do not maintain our current credit ratings available credit under our revolving credit facility is subject to limitations based on specified percentages of the costs of homes developed lots and lots under development included in inventory and the amount of other senior unsecured indebtedness under the most restrictive of the limitations imposed by our indentures and revolving credit agreement as of september 30 2005 we would have been permitted to increase our homebuilding debt by approximately 25 billion this amount is not intended as an indication of the amount of additional debt we could in fact obtain 

  change of control purchase options if a change of control occurs as defined in the indentures governing many series of our senior and senior subordinated notes constituting 24948 million principal amount in the aggregate we would be required to offer to purchase such notes at 101 of their principal amount together with all accrued and unpaid interest if any moreover a change of control may also result in the acceleration of our revolving credit facility if purchase offers were required under the indentures for these notes or our revolving credit facility debt were accelerated we can give no assurance that we would have sufficient funds to pay the amounts that we would be required to repurchase or repay we currently would not have sufficient funds available to purchase all of such outstanding debt upon a change of control 

  impact of financial services debt our financial services business is conducted through subsidiaries that are not restricted by our indentures or revolving credit facility the ability of our financial services segment to provide funds to our homebuilding operations is subject to restrictions in its credit facilities these funds will not be available to us in the event of defaults under these facilities moreover our right to receive assets from these subsidiaries upon liquidation or recapitalization will be subject to the prior claims of the creditors of these subsidiaries our claims to funds from this segment would be subordinate to subsidiary indebtedness to the extent of any security for such indebtedness and to any indebtedness otherwise recognized as senior to our claims 

   the homebuilding industry is highly competitive homebuilders compete not only for homebuyers but also for desirable properties financing raw materials and skilled labor we compete with other local regional and national homebuilders including those with a sales presence on the internet often within larger subdivisions designed planned and developed by such homebuilders the competitive conditions in the homebuilding industry could result in 

   our financial services business competes with other mortgage lenders including national regional and local mortgage bankers savings and loan associations and other financial institutions mortgage lenders with greater access to capital markets or different lending criteria may be able to offer more attractive financing to potential customers 

  if we are affected by these competitive conditions at increased levels our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

   our operations require significant amounts of cash we may be required to seek additional capital whether from sales of equity or debt or additional bank borrowings for the future growth and development of our business we can give no assurance as to the availability of such additional capital or if available whether it would be on terms acceptable to us moreover the indentures for most of our outstanding public debt and the covenants of our revolving credit facility contain provisions that may restrict the debt we may incur in the future if we are not successful in obtaining sufficient capital it could reduce our sales and may adversely affect our future growth and financial results 

   since 1993 we have acquired many homebuilding companies although we have recently focused on internal growth we may make strategic acquisitions of homebuilding companies in the future successful strategic acquisitions require the integration of operations and management and other efforts to realize the benefits that may be available although we believe that we have been successful in doing so in the past we can give no assurance that we would be able to identify acquire and integrate successfully strategic acquisitions in the future acquisitions can result in the dilution of existing stockholders if we issue our common stock as consideration or reduce our liquidity or increase our debt if we fund them with cash in addition acquisitions can expose us to the risk of writing off goodwill related to such acquisitions based on the subsequent results of the reporting units to which the acquired businesses were assigned moreover we may not be able to implement successfully our operating and growth strategies within our existing markets 

   as a homebuilder we are subject to home warranty and construction defect claims arising in the ordinary course of business as a consequence we maintain product liability insurance obtain indemnities and certificates of insurance from subcontractors generally covering claims related to workmanship and materials and create warranty and other reserves for the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built because of the uncertainties inherent to these matters we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will be adequate to address all of our warranty and 

15 construction defect claims in the future contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce we may be responsible for applicable selfinsured retentions and some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits additionally the coverage offered by and the availability of product liability insurance for construction defects are currently limited and costly we have responded to the recent increases in insurance costs and coverage limitations by increasing our selfinsured retentions and claim reserves there can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted and become more costly

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition tableend critical accounting policies 

  general  — a comprehensive enumeration of the significant accounting policies of dr horton inc and subsidiaries is presented in note a to the accompanying financial statements as of september 30 2005 and 2004 and for the years ended september 30 2005 2004 and 2003 each of our accounting policies has been chosen based upon current authoritative literature that collectively comprises us generally accepted accounting principles gaap in instances where alternative methods of accounting are permissible under gaap we have chosen the method that most appropriately reflects the nature of our business the results of our operations and our financial condition and have consistently applied those methods over each of the periods presented in the financial statements the audit committee of our board of directors has reviewed and approved the accounting policies selected 

  basis of presentation  — our financial statements include the accounts of dr horton inc and all of its whollyowned majorityowned and controlled subsidiaries all significant intercompany accounts transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation we have also consolidated certain variable interest entities from which we are purchasing lots under option purchase contracts under the requirements of interpretation no 46 issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb 

  use of estimates  — the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ materially from those estimates 

  segment information  — we report our consolidated financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 131 “disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information” our homebuilding operating regions are our operating segments under sfas no 131 and have been aggregated into a single homebuilding reportable segment our homebuilding segment derives the majority of its revenue from constructing and selling singlefamily housing in 25 states and 74 markets throughout the united states our other operating and reporting segment is our financial services segment the financial services segment generates revenue by originating and selling mortgage loans and by collecting fees for title insurance and closing services in many of the same markets we have no foreign subsidiaries or operations 

  revenue recognition  — we generally recognize homebuilding revenue and related profit at the time of the closing of a sale when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer in situations where the buyer’s financing is originated by dhi mortgage our whollyowned mortgage subsidiary and the buyer has not made an adequate initial investment as prescribed by sfas no 66 the gross profit on such sales is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a thirdparty investor has been completed virtually all of our homebuilding revenues are received in cash within a day or two of closing we include amounts in transit from title companies at the end of each reporting period in homebuilding cash when we execute sales contracts with our homebuyers or when we require advance payment from homebuyers for custom changes upgrades or options related to their homes we record the cash deposits received as liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are canceled we either retain or refund to the homebuyer deposits on canceled sales contracts depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances 

  we recognize financial services revenues associated with our title operations as closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued both of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed we transfer substantially all underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies to thirdparty insurers we recognize the majority of the revenues associated with our mortgage operations when the mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to thirdparty investors origination fees and direct origination costs are deferred and recognized as revenues and expenses respectively along with the associated gains and losses on the sales of the loans and related servicing rights when the loans are sold we sell all mortgage loans and related servicing rights to thirdparty investors 

20   some of the loans sold by dhi mortgage are sold with limited recourse provisions based on historical experience we estimate and record an allowance for losses related to loans sold with recourse in the past such losses have not been significant 

  inventories and cost of sales  — we state inventories at the lower of historical cost or fair value in accordance with sfas no 144 in addition to the costs of direct land acquisition land development and home construction inventory costs include interest real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and home construction applicable direct overhead costs that we incur after development projects or homes are substantially complete such as utilities maintenance and cleaning are charged to selling general and administrative sga expense as incurred all indirect overhead costs such as compensation of construction superintendents sales personnel and division and region management advertising and builder’s risk insurance are charged to sga expense as incurred 

  we use the specific identification method for the purpose of accumulating home construction costs cost of sales for homes closed includes the specific construction costs of each home and all applicable land acquisition land development and related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each project any changes to the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial home closings in a project are generally allocated on a prorata basis to the remaining homes in the project 

  when a home is closed we generally have not yet paid and recorded all incurred costs necessary to complete the home each month we record as a liability and as a charge to cost of sales the amount we determine will ultimately be paid related to completed homes that have been closed as of the end of that month we compare our home construction budgets to actual recorded costs to determine the additional costs remaining to be paid on each closed home we monitor the accuracy of each month’s accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on closed homes in subsequent months to the amount we accrued although actual costs to be paid on closed homes in the future could differ from our current accruals our method has historically been consistently accurate 

  each quarter we review all components of our inventory for the purpose of determining whether recorded costs and costs required to complete each home or project are recoverable if our review indicates that an impairment loss is required under the sfas no 144 guidelines we estimate and record such loss to cost of sales in that quarter to date such impairment losses have been insignificant in the aggregate fair value estimation under sfas no 144 involves management estimates of future revenues and costs and due to uncertainties in the estimation process actual results could differ from such estimates 

  consolidation of variable interest entities  — in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” as amended fin 46 fin 46 provides guidance for the financial accounting and reporting of interests in certain variable interest entities which fin 46 defines as certain business entities that either have equity investors with no voting rights or have equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entities to support their activities fin 46 requires consolidation of such entities by any company that is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the entities’ activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entities’ residual returns or both defined as the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity 

  in the ordinary course of business we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts in order to procure land or lots for the construction of homes under such option purchase contracts we will fund a stated deposit in consideration for the right but not the obligation to purchase land or lots at a future point in time with predetermined terms under the terms of the option purchase contracts many of our option deposits are not refundable at our discretion certain of these deposits are deemed to create a variable interest in a variable interest entity under the requirements of fin 46 as such certain of our option purchase contracts result in the acquisition of a variable interest in the entity holding the land parcel under option 

  in applying the provisions of fin 46 we evaluate those land and lot option purchase contracts with variable interest entities to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary based upon analysis of the 

21 variability of the expected gains and losses of the entity based on this evaluation if we are the primary beneficiary of an entity with which we have entered into a land or lot option purchase contract the variable interest entity is consolidated 

  since we own no equity interest in any of the unaffiliated variable interest entities that we must consolidate pursuant to fin 46 we generally have little or no control or influence over the operations of these entities or their owners when our requests for financial information are denied by the land sellers certain assumptions about the assets and liabilities of such entities are required in most cases the fair value of the assets of the consolidated entities has been assumed to be the remaining contractual purchase price of the land or lots we are purchasing in these cases it is assumed that the entities have no debt obligations and the only asset recorded is the land or lots we have the option to buy with a related offset to minority interest for the assumed third party investment in the variable interest entity creditors if any of these variable interest entities have no recourse against us 

  warranty costs  — we have established warranty reserves by charging cost of sales and crediting a warranty liability for each home closed we estimate the amounts charged to be adequate to cover expected warrantyrelated costs for materials and labor required under one and tenyear warranty obligation periods the oneyear warranty is comprehensive for all parts and labor the tenyear period is for major construction defects our warranty cost accruals are based upon our historical warranty cost experience in each market in which we operate and are adjusted as appropriate to reflect qualitative risks associated with the type of homes we build and the geographic areas in which we build them actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts a 10 change in the historical warranty rates used to estimate our warranty accrual would not result in a material change in our accrual 

  insurance claim costs  — we have and require the majority of our subcontractors to have general liability insurance including construction defect coverage and workers compensation insurance these insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims subject to certain selfinsured retentions deductibles and other coverage limits in some states where we believe it is too difficult or expensive for our subcontractors to obtain general liability insurance we have waived our traditional subcontractor general liability insurance requirements to obtain lower bids from subcontractors we selfinsure a portion of our overall risk partially through the use of a captive insurance entity which issues a general liability policy to us naming some subcontractors as additional insureds 

  we record expenses and liabilities for costs to cover our selfinsured and deductible amounts under our insurance policies and for any estimated costs of claims and lawsuits in excess of our coverage limits or not covered by our policies based on an analysis of our historical claims which includes an estimate of construction defect claims incurred but not yet reported projection of losses related to these liabilities is subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends in construction defect claims relative to our markets and the types of products we build claim settlement patterns insurance industry practices and legal interpretations among others because of the high degree of judgment required in determining these estimated liability amounts actual future costs could differ significantly from our currently estimated amounts a 10 change in the claim rate or the average cost per claim used to estimate the selfinsured accruals would not result in a material change in our accrual 

  goodwill  — we adopted sfas no 142 at the beginning of fiscal 2002 under its provisions we are no longer permitted to amortize goodwill to earnings such amounts are recorded on our balance sheet under the caption “goodwill” sfas no 142 requires companies to periodically assess recorded goodwill amounts for the purpose of determining whether any impairments have occurred and need to be recorded we have measured the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model and determined that the fair value of our reporting units is greater than their book value and therefore no impairment of goodwill exists we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining balance of goodwill may not be recoverable the goodwill assessment procedures required by sfas no 142 require management to make comprehensive estimates of future revenues and costs due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates actual results could differ from such estimates 

22   income taxes  — we calculate a provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes in determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns judgment is required differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 

  in december 2004 the fasb issued staff position 1091 “application of fasb statement no 109 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of 2004” fsp 1091 the american jobs creation act which was signed into law in october 2004 provides a tax deduction on qualified domestic production activities when fully phasedin the deduction will be up to 9 of the lesser of “qualified production activities income” or taxable income based on the guidance provided by fsp 1091 this deduction should be accounted for as a special deduction under sfas no 109 and will reduce tax expense in the period or periods that the amounts are deductible on the tax return the tax benefit resulting from the new deduction will be effective beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2006 we are evaluating the impact of this law on our future financial statements and we currently estimate the future reduction in our federal income tax rate to be in the range of 050 to 075 

  stockbased compensation  — with the approval of our compensation committee consisting of independent members of our board of directors we from time to time issue to employees and directors options to purchase our common stock the committee approves grants only out of amounts remaining available for grant from amounts formally authorized by our common stockholders we typically grant approved options with exercise prices equal to the market price of our common stock on the date of the option grant the majority of the options granted vest ratably over a tenyear period we account for options under the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and accordingly recognize no compensation expense for the grants sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” and sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation — transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 123” require us to disclose the effects on net income and diluted net income per share had we recorded compensation expense in accordance with sfas no 123 the sfas no 123 requirements applied only to options granted after its effective date 

  in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” this statement which replaces sfas no 123 and supersedes apb opinion no 25 requires that companies measure and recognize compensation expense at an amount equal to the fair value of sharebased payments granted under compensation arrangements the statement is effective beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2006 we have evaluated the impact of the adoption of sfas no 123r and we have determined that it will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

results of operations — fiscal year 2005 overview 

  we generated significant increases in revenues and earnings during the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 driven primarily by the continued growth of our homebuilding operations and by significant improvements in homebuilding profit margins 

  the demand from firsttime and moveup homebuyers in the united states was favorable during fiscal 2005 as national new home sales remained at a historically high level additionally low mortgage rates continued to be a positive influence on housing demand during fiscal 2005 

  however we believe that the primary drivers of housing demand were local in nature related to the strength of marketspecific economic factors such as local job growth unemployment rates and income growth additionally we believe that the supply of new homes was significantly affected by local factors such as government approval processes and the availability of land and lots suitable for residential construction in a number of markets increasingly difficult and lengthy governmental approval processes have limited the supply of new housing which has contributed to new home price appreciation due to 

23 such local factors housing demand and supply has varied significantly among markets which has created differing competitive dynamics for homebuilders in each individual market due in part to these factors the overall us homebuilding industry remains highly fragmented however the industry consolidation that began in the early 1990s continued in 2005 

  in 2005 we continued to execute our strategy of generating consistent profitable growth through gaining market share increasing capital allocated to strong homebuilding markets and capitalizing on our national regional and local scale to improve our material labor and capital cost structures 

  key financial highlights for our fiscal year ended september 30 2005 were as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

   our operating strategy for fiscal 2006 is to take advantage of opportunities to grow our homebuilding business profitability through capturing greater market share while continuing to maintain a strong balance sheet we plan to execute our growth strategy primarily by investing our available capital in our existing homebuilding markets through our capital allocation process and entering satellite markets as opportunities are available however we will continue to evaluate homebuilding acquisition opportunities as they arise to the extent that additional capital is available in excess of amounts we choose to invest in our homebuilding operations we will consider directing such capital toward alternative uses including stock 

24 repurchases as market conditions or other circumstances may warrant within the constraints of our balance sheet leverage targets and the restrictions in our bank agreements and indentures 

results of operations — homebuilding 

   the following tables set forth key operating and financial data for our homebuilding operations by geographic region as of and for the fiscal years ended september 30 2005 and 2004 

   25 homebuilding operating margin analysis 

   net sales orders represent the number and dollar value of new sales contracts executed with customers net of sales contract cancellations the value of net sales orders increased 28 to 146434 million 53232 homes in 2005 from 114062 million 45263 homes in 2004 the overall cancellation rates of the value of new sales contracts in 2005 and 2004 were 19 and 17 respectively the average price of a net sales order in 2005 was 275100 up 9 from the 252000 average in 2004 the number and value of net sales orders increased in all five of our market regions reflecting the successful execution of our organic growth strategies and the overall strong demand for our homes in fiscal 2005 

  all regions produced doubledigit percentage increases in the value of net sales orders during fiscal 2005 led by a 48 increase in the southeast region resulting from our continued expansion of our presence in our florida markets where housing demand is high the average price of net sales orders increased in all of our regions except the midwest where the average sales price was down 5 due to our efforts to offer more lowerpriced products in the chicago market while we continue to increase prices in the markets where demand for our homes is strongest we remain focused on ensuring that our core product offerings and prices in most of our markets remain affordable for our core customers typically firsttime and moveup homebuyers 

  sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period some of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies including mortgage loan approval which can result in cancellations in the past our backlog has been a reliable indicator of the level of closings in our two subsequent fiscal quarters although some contracts in backlog will not result in closings historically our backlog conversion rates closings during the quarter divided by beginning of the quarter backlog have generally been in the range between 50 and 75 with the highest quarterly conversion rate of each fiscal year typically occurring in the fourth quarter 

  at september 30 2005 the value of our backlog of sales orders was 58352 million 19244 homes up 28 from 45685 million 17184 homes at september 30 2004 the average sales price of homes in backlog was 303200 at september 30 2005 up 14 from the 265900 average at september 30 2004 the value of our sales order backlog increased in all five of our market regions led by increases of 52 in our midatlantic region where we have significantly increased our capital investment and 49 in our midwest region where sales in our chicago market were especially strong in 2005 the average selling price of homes in backlog increased in four of our five market regions with the largest increases occurring in our southeast and southwest regions where generally strong demand for our homes allowed us to increase prices the average sales price in the midwest was down 6 due to the strong market acceptance of recently introduced more affordably priced products in the chicago market 

  revenues from home sales increased 28 to 133766 million 51172 homes closed in 2005 from 104911 million 43567 homes closed in 2004 revenues from home sales increased by more than 20 and the number of homes closed increased by 10 or more in four of our five market regions these results reflect the successful execution of our growth strategies continued strength in demand for new 

26 homes and our homebuilding divisions’ ability to efficiently deliver homes in backlog to homebuyers the average selling price of homes we closed during 2005 was 261400 up 9 from 240800 in 2004 the average selling price of homes closed increased by 9 or more in four of our five market regions the average selling price of homes closed in our midwest region decreased by 2 due to our offerings of more affordable products in the chicago market revenues from home sales in fiscal 2005 were reduced by a 922 million deferral of gross profit at september 30 2005 in accordance with sfas 66 

  total homebuilding gross profit increased by 42 to 34883 million in 2005 from 24607 million in 2004 including sales of both homes and landlots total homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding revenues increased 250 basis points to 256 in 2005 from 231 in 2004 gross profit from home sales as a percentage of home sales revenues increased 260 basis points to 254 in 2005 from 228 in 2004 this gross profit improvement is attributable to our ability to increase home prices in many of our markets our ongoing efforts to control and reduce construction costs through our local regional and national purchasing efforts our ongoing reallocation of capital to our more profitable markets and a decrease in the capitalized interest amortized to cost of sales attributable to our homebuilding leverage ratio improvement and our debt refinancing efforts over the past two years 

  sga expenses from homebuilding activities increased by 28 to 12266 million in 2005 from 9590 million in 2004 as a percentage of revenues sga expenses were 90 in both years 

  interest incurred related to homebuilding debt increased by 17 to 2773 million in 2005 from 2367 million in 2004 while our average daily homebuilding debt increased 26 in 2005 from 2004 the percentage increase in our average homebuilding debt was higher than the percentage increase in our interest incurred due to the march 2004 restructuring of our unsecured revolving credit facility which resulted in lower borrowing costs throughout 2005 and due to our efforts over the past two fiscal years to replace some of our higher interest rate notes with notes bearing lower interest rates 

  we capitalize interest costs only to inventory under construction or development during both fiscal years our inventory under construction or development exceeded our interestbearing debt therefore we capitalized all interest from homebuilding debt except for the unamortized discounts premiums and fees related to debt we paid off prior to maturity interest amortized to cost of sales decreased by 10 to 2250 million in 2005 from 2490 million in 2004 this reduction in interest amortized to total cost of sales is a direct result of the reductions in our homebuilding leverage and our debt refinancing efforts over the last two years 

  other income net of other expenses associated with homebuilding activities was 157 million in 2005 compared to 99 million in 2004 the major component of other income in both 2005 and 2004 was the increase in the fair value of our interest rate swaps of 95 million and 81 million respectively also included in other income in 2005 and 2004 was interest income of 39 million and 22 million respectively 

   the following tables set forth key operating and financial data for our homebuilding operations by geographic region as of and for the fiscal years ended september 30 2004 and 2003 

   28 homebuilding operating margin analysis 

   the value of net sales orders increased 24 to 114062 million 45263 homes in 2004 from 91623 million 38725 homes in 2003 the overall cancellation rates of the value of new sales contracts in 2004 and 2003 were 17 and 18 respectively the average price of a net sales order in 2004 was 252000 up 7 from the 236600 average in 2003 the number of homes sold value and the average price of net sales orders increased in each of our market regions during 2004 due to the successful execution of our growth strategies and generally strong demand for our homes in all of our market regions the largest increases in the value of net sales orders occurred in the southeast and midatlantic regions which was the result of our efforts to significantly increase our presence in our florida virginia and maryland markets the increase in our average selling price reflected our ability to increase prices in the markets where demand for our homes was strongest in 2004 while we continued our efforts to ensure that our product offerings and prices in most of our markets remain affordable for our target customers typically firsttime and moveup homebuyers 

  at september 30 2004 the value of our backlog of sales orders was 45685 million 17184 homes up 25 from 36534 million 15488 homes at september 30 2003 the average sales price of homes in backlog was 265900 at september 30 2004 up 13 from the 235900 average at september 30 2003 the value of our sales order backlog increased in four of our five market regions led by a 92 increase in the southeast region which was a result of our efforts to significantly increase our presence in our florida markets the average selling price of homes in backlog increased in all of our market regions reflecting the generally strong demand for our homes in fiscal 2004 which allowed us to increase prices 

  revenues from home sales increased 26 to 104911 million 43567 homes closed in 2004 from 83341 million 35934 homes closed in 2003 revenues from home sales increased by more than 20 in all of our five market regions and the number of homes closed increased by 15 or more in all market regions reflecting the successful execution of our growth strategies and our homebuilding divisions’ ability to efficiently deliver homes in backlog to homebuyers the average selling price of homes we closed during 2004 was 240800 up 4 from 231900 in 2003 the average selling price of homes closed increased in four of our five market regions with the largest increases occurring in the southeast and midatlantic regions 

  total homebuilding gross profit increased by 41 to 24607 million in 2004 from 17463 million in 2003 including sales of both homes and landlots total homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding revenues increased 270 basis points to 231 in 2004 from 204 in 2003 gross profit from home sales as a percentage of home sales revenues increased 220 basis points to 228 in 2004 from 206 in 2003 which was attributable to our ability to increase home prices due to strong demand for our homes in many of our markets in 2004 and our ongoing efforts to control and reduce construction costs as we achieve greater economies of scale 

  sga expenses from homebuilding activities increased by 17 to 9590 million in 2004 from 8170 million in 2003 as a percentage of revenues sga expenses decreased 60 basis points to 90 in 2004 from 96 in 2003 the improvement in sga expenses as a percentage of revenues was 

29 attributable to our ongoing cost control efforts and our ability to generate higher revenue levels that better leveraged our existing fixed sga expenses in 2004 

  interest incurred related to homebuilding debt decreased by 1 to 2367 million in 2004 from 2395 million in 2003 our average homebuilding debt increased 5 in 2004 from 2003 however we replaced certain of our higher interest rate notes with notes bearing lower interest rates and we restructured and amended our unsecured revolving credit facility which lowered our interest costs resulting in this slight decrease in interest incurred in 2004 

  we capitalize interest costs only to inventory under construction or development during both years our inventory under construction or development exceeded our interestbearing debt therefore we capitalized all interest from homebuilding debt except for the unamortized discounts and fees related to debt we paid off prior to maturity interest amortized to cost of sales increased by 13 to 2490 million in 2004 from 2194 million in 2003 this increase was attributable to a 20 increase in total cost of sales partially offset by the effects of the decline in interest incurred 

  other income associated with homebuilding activities was 99 million in 2004 compared to other expense of 94 million in 2003 the major component of other income in 2004 was an increase in the fair value of our interest rate swaps of 81 million the major component of other expense in 2003 was 118 million of minority interests in the income of our consolidated joint ventures 

30 results of operations — financial services 

   the following tables set forth key operating and financial data for our financial services operations comprising dhi mortgage and our subsidiary title companies for the fiscal years ended september 30 2005 and 2004 

     the volume of loans originated and brokered by our mortgage operations is directly related to the number and value of homes closed by our homebuilding operations total firstlien loans originated or brokered by dhi mortgage for our homebuyers increased 23 in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 which was greater than our 17 increase in the number of homes closed because the percentage of total home closings from our own homebuyers for which dhi mortgage handled the financing our mortgage capture rate increased to 63 in 2005 from 61 in 2004 home closings from our own homebuyers 

31 constituted 93 of dhi mortgage loan originations in 2005 compared to 92 in 2004 reflecting dhi mortgage’s continued focus on supporting the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations sales of loans to thirdparty investors increased 28 in 2005 as compared to 2004 

  revenues from the financial services segment increased 29 to 2351 million in 2005 from 1828 million in 2004 the increase in financial services revenues was primarily due to the increase in the number of mortgage loans originated and sold while the average mortgage revenues earned per loan sold remained relatively constant the majority of the revenues associated with our mortgage operations are recognized when the mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to thirdparty investors 

  general and administrative expenses associated with financial services increased 22 to 1476 million in 2005 from 1210 million in 2004 as a percentage of financial services revenues general and administrative expenses decreased by 340 basis points to 628 in 2005 from 662 in 2004 the improvement in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of financial services revenue was due primarily to the increase in revenues which better leveraged our fixed costs in 2005 as compared to 2004 and was also due to the effective cost control efforts of our financial services operations 

   the following tables set forth key operating and financial data for our financial services operations for the fiscal years ended september 30 2004 and 2003 

  32    total firstlien loans originated or brokered by dhi mortgage for our homebuyers increased 21 in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 consistent with our 21 increase in the number of homes closed the percentage of total home closings from our own homebuyers which had financing handled by dhi mortgage our mortgage capture rate was 61 in both years home closings from our own homebuyers constituted 92 of dhi mortgage loan originations in 2004 compared to 82 in 2003 reflecting a decrease in the number of refinance loans originated in 2004 sales of loans to thirdparty investors increased 5 in 2004 as compared to 2003 

  revenues from the financial services segment increased 4 to 1828 million in 2004 from 1760 million in 2003 the increase in financial services revenues was primarily due to an increase in the number of mortgage loan originations to customers of our homebuilding operations and sold to thirdparty investors offset by a decline in the average mortgage revenues earned per loan sold the decrease in the average mortgage revenues earned per loan was primarily due to a shift in the product mix of mortgage loans originated and sold from higher margin fixedrate loans to lower margin adjustablerate loans and increased competition due to excess capacity in the mortgage industry which reduced the margins on all mortgage loans in 2004 

  general and administrative expenses associated with financial services increased 23 to 1210 million in 2004 from 983 million in 2003 as a percentage of financial services revenues general and administrative expenses increased to 662 in 2004 from 559 in 2003 the increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of financial services revenue and the related decrease in income before income taxes were due primarily to the decline in average mortgage revenues earned per loan and increased costs associated with strengthening our financial services infrastructure to support our growing homebuilding business and expanding our mortgage operations into california 

capital resources and liquidity 

  we fund our homebuilding and financial services operations with cash flows from operating activities borrowings under our bank credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities as we utilize our capital resources and liquidity to fund the growth of our operations we have focused on maintaining strong balance sheet leverage ratios 

  at september 30 2005 our ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital was 322 an improvement of 670 basis points from 389 at september 30 2004 net homebuilding debt to total capital consists of homebuilding notes payable net of cash divided by total capital homebuilding notes payable net of cash plus stockholders’ equity the improvement reflects a 35 increase in stockholders’ equity while net homebuilding debt increased only 1 our operating target range for net homebuilding debt to total capital is below 45 so the 322 ratio at september 30 2005 is well below our targeted operating leverage level future fiscal yearend net homebuilding debt to total capital ratios may be higher than the fiscal 2005 yearend ratio 

  we believe that the ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital is useful in understanding the leverage employed in our homebuilding operations and comparing us with other homebuilders we exclude the debt of our financial services business because the business is separately capitalized its debt is 

33 substantially collateralized and our financial services debt is not guaranteed by our parent company or any of our homebuilding entities we include cash because of its capital function for comparison at september 30 2005 and 2004 our ratios of homebuilding debt to total capital were 406 and 432 respectively 

  we believe that we will be able to continue to fund our homebuilding and financial services operations and our future cash needs including debt maturities through a combination of our existing cash resources cash flows from operations our existing or renewed credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities through the public debt markets 

   cash  — at september 30 2005 our available homebuilding cash and cash equivalents amounted to 11116 million 

  bank credit facility  — we have a 121 billion unsecured revolving credit facility which includes a 350 million letter of credit subfacility that matures on march 25 2008 the facility is guaranteed by substantially all of our whollyowned subsidiaries other than our financial services subsidiaries we borrow funds through the revolving credit facility throughout the year to fund working capital requirements and we repay such borrowings with cash generated from our operations and from the issuance of public debt securities 

  we had no outstanding cash borrowings on our homebuilding revolving credit facility at september 30 2005 and 2004 under the debt covenants associated with our revolving credit facility when we have fewer than two investment grade senior unsecured debt ratings from moody’s investors service fitch ratings and standard and poor’s corporation our additional homebuilding borrowing capacity under the facility is limited to the lesser of the unused portion of the facility 109 billion at september 30 2005 or an amount determined under a borrowing base arrangement under the borrowing base limitation the sum of our senior debt and the amount drawn on our revolving credit facility may not exceed certain percentages of the various categories of our unencumbered inventory at september 30 2005 the borrowing base arrangement would have limited our additional borrowing capacity from any source to 25 billion effective november 7 2005 we now have the two required debt ratings so the borrowing base limitation is not currently in effect at september 30 2005 we were in compliance with all of the covenants limitations and restrictions that form a part of our public debt obligations and our bank revolving credit facility 

  we are currently in negotiations to refinance our revolving credit facility which we expect will extend the maturity date and increase the capacity of the facility lower the interest rate spread we must pay on borrowings under the facility and slightly revise certain other terms covenants limitations and restrictions under the facility we expect the new revolving credit facility to be completed and in effect by december 31 2005 

  shelf registration statements  — at september 30 2005 we had the capacity to issue new debt or equity securities amounting to 30 billion under our universal shelf registration statement also at september 30 2005 we had the capacity to issue approximately 225 million shares of common stock under our acquisition shelf registration statement to effect in whole or in part possible future business acquisitions 

  debt repayments  — on april 1 2005 we repaid the 200 million principal amount of our 105 senior notes which became due on that date 

  on july 15 2005 we redeemed the 235 million principal amount of our 9375 senior notes due 2009 at an aggregate redemption price of approximately 246 million plus accrued interest the notes were originally issued by schuler homes inc and were assumed by us in our merger with schuler in february 2002 concurrent with the redemption we recorded interest expense of approximately 44 million representing the call premium net of the unamortized premium related to the redeemed notes 

   cash  — at september 30 2005 we had available financial services cash and cash equivalents of 382 million 

  mortgage warehouse loan facility  — our mortgage subsidiary renewed and amended its 300 million mortgage warehouse loan facility in april 2005 increasing the amount that may be borrowed under the uncommitted accordion provisions to 150 million and extending its maturity to april 7 2006 our borrowing capacity under this facility is limited to the lesser of the unused portion of the facility as adjusted by the accordion provisions or otherwise by agreement of the parties or an amount determined under a borrowing base arrangement under the borrowing base limitation the amount drawn on our mortgage warehouse loan facility may not exceed 98 of all eligible mortgage loans held for sale and made available to the lenders to secure any borrowings under the facility 

  through amendment to the credit agreement in june 2005 we obtained additional commitments from our lenders through the accordion provisions that increased the total commitments under the facility to 450 million to provide for fiscal yearend closing volume we obtained temporary commitment increases of 225 million through amendments to the credit agreement in september 2005 which resulted in a total capacity of 675 million at september 30 2005 through amendments to the credit agreement in october and november 2005 the commitments under the facility were adjusted to 450 million effective from october 28 2005 through january 15 2006 on january 16 2006 the total capacity will return to 300 million subject to increase to 450 million should the accordion provisions be implemented again at september 30 2005 we had borrowings of 5495 million outstanding under the mortgage warehouse facility 

  commercial paper conduit facility  — our mortgage subsidiary also has a 500 million commercial paper conduit facility the cp conduit facility that expires on june 29 2006 through amendment to the credit agreement in june 2005 we increased the capacity available under this facility from 300 million to 500 million to provide for fiscal yearend closing volume we obtained a temporary increase of 200 million through amendments to the credit agreement in september 2005 which resulted in a total capacity of 700 million at september 30 2005 the temporary increase was effective through october 14 2005 when the capacity decreased to 600 million available through november 10 2005 beginning on november 11 2005 the total capacity decreased to 500 million the terms of the facility are renewable annually by the sponsoring banks at september 30 2005 700 million was drawn under the cp conduit facility 

  in the past we have been able to renew or extend the mortgage warehouse loan facility and the cp conduit facility on satisfactory terms prior to their maturities and obtain temporary additional commitments through amendments of the respective credit agreements during periods of higher than normal volumes of mortgages held for sale although we do not anticipate any problems in renewing or extending these facilities or obtaining temporary additional commitments in the future the liquidity of our financial services business depends upon our continued ability to do so 

  the mortgage warehouse loan facility and the cp conduit facility are not guaranteed by either the parent company or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt borrowings under both facilities are secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale the mortgage loans assigned to secure the cp conduit facility are used as collateral for asset backed commercial paper issued by multiseller conduits in the commercial paper market at september 30 2005 our total mortgage loans held for sale were 13587 million all mortgage company activities are financed with the mortgage warehouse facility the cp conduit facility or internally generated funds our mortgage warehouse loan facility and our cp conduit facility contain financial covenants as to our mortgage subsidiary’s minimum required tangible net worth its maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and its minimum required net income our mortgage subsidiary is in compliance with each of these covenants 

   during the year ended september 30 2005 we used 6207 million of cash in our operating activities as compared to 4225 million during the prior year the net cash used in operations in fiscal 2005 and 2004 was the result of cash provided from net income and increases in accounts payable and other liabilities offset by cash used to increase residential land lot and home inventories mortgage loans held for sale and other assets reflecting the growth of our homebuilding and financial services operations among other factors the variance in operating cash flows from fiscal 2004 to 2005 is a result of our decision to invest 19 billion of cash to fund inventory growth in fiscal 2005 versus a 14 billion cash investment in inventory growth in fiscal 2004 

  a large portion of our cash invested in inventories represents purchases of land and lots that will be used to generate revenues and cash flows in future years since we control the amounts and timing of our investments in land and lots based on our future growth goals and our market opportunities we believe that cash flows from operating activities before increases in residential land and lot inventories is currently a better indicator of our liquidity 

   in fiscal 2005 and 2004 cash used in investing activities represented net purchases of property and equipment primarily model home furniture and office equipment such purchases partially increase with our growth but they are not significant relative to our total assets or cash flows and they typically do not vary significantly from year to year 

   the majority of our shortterm financing needs are funded with cash generated from operations and funds available under our homebuilding and financial services credit facilities longterm financing needs are typically funded with the issuance of new senior unsecured debt securities through the public capital markets our homebuilding senior and senior subordinated notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our whollyowned subsidiaries other than our financial services subsidiaries 

  in october 2004 we issued 250 million of 4875 senior notes due 2010 we used the proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes including land acquisition and development home construction and homebuilding operations and other working capital needs 

  in december 2004 we issued 300 million of 5625 senior notes due 2016 we used the proceeds from this offering to repay borrowings under the revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes 

  in february 2005 we issued 300 million of 525 senior notes due 2015 we used the proceeds from this offering to repay borrowings under the revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes 

  in july 2005 we issued 300 million of 5375 senior notes due 2012 we used the proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes including the repayment of borrowings under the revolving credit facility and for the early redemption of our 9375 senior notes due 2009 

  during fiscal 2005 our board of directors declared one quarterly cash dividend of 006 per common share splitadjusted one quarterly cash dividend of 00675 per common share splitadjusted and two quarterly cash dividends of 009 per common share the last of which was paid on august 19 2005 to stockholders of record on august 5 2005 on october 6 2005 our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 009 per common share which was paid on october 31 2005 to stockholders of record on october 20 2005 

   in december 2003 our board of directors declared a threefortwo stock split effected as a 50 stock dividend paid on january 12 2004 to holders of record of our common stock as of december 22

  in july 2003 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 200 million of our common stock and outstanding debt securities as market conditions warrant in may 2005 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 1756 million of our common stock and up to 200 million of our outstanding debt securities representing the amounts then remaining of the 2003 authorization as of september 30 2005 we had 1756 million remaining of the board of directors’ authorization for repurchases of common stock and 200 million remaining of the authorization for repurchases of debt securities 

  on november 17 2005 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 500 million of our common stock and up to 200 million of outstanding debt securities replacing the existing common stock and debt securities repurchase authorization 

contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments 

  our primary contractual cash obligations for our homebuilding and financial services segments are payments under shortterm and longterm debt agreements and lease payments under operating leases purchase obligations of our homebuilding segment represent specific performance requirements under lot option purchase agreements that may require us to purchase land contingent upon the land seller meeting certain obligations we expect to fund our contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business through our operating cash flows our homebuilding and financial services credit facilities and by accessing the capital markets 

  our future cash requirements for contractual obligations as of september 30 2005 are presented below 

   at september 30 2005 our homebuilding operations had outstanding letters of credit of 1372 million and surety bonds of 18 billion issued by third parties to secure performance under various contracts we expect that our performance obligations secured by these letters of credit and bonds will generally be completed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms when we complete our performance obligations the related letters of credit and bonds are generally released shortly thereafter leaving us with no continuing obligations we have no material thirdparty guarantees 

  to meet the financing needs of our customers our mortgage operations extend interest rate lock commitments irlcs to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and meet defined credit and underwriting criteria typically the irlcs have a duration of less than six months some irlcs are 

37 committed immediately to a specific investor through the use of bestefforts whole loan delivery commitments while other irlcs are funded prior to being committed to thirdparty investors 

  we manage interest rate risk related to our uncommitted irlcs through the use of forward sales of mortgagebacked securities fmbs and the purchase of eurodollar futures contracts edfc on certain loan types as of september 30 2005 our irlcs totaled 6228 million and we had approximately 1433 million outstanding of fmbs and edfc and 4920 million of best efforts whole loan delivery commitments related to our irlcs 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  in the ordinary course of business we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts in order to procure land or lots for the construction of homes lot option contracts enable us to control significant lot positions with a minimal capital investment and substantially reduce the risks associated with land ownership and development at september 30 2005 we had 2874 million in deposits to purchase land and lots with a total remaining purchase price of 59 billion of which only 2308 million of the remaining purchase price is subject to specific performance clauses which may require us to purchase the land or lots upon the land seller meeting certain obligations pursuant to fin 46 we consolidated certain variable interest entities with assets of 2004 million 

land and lot position and homes in inventory 

  at september 30 2005 we controlled approximately 346000 lots 55 of which were lots under option or similar contracts the following is a summary of our landlot position at september 30 

   the total number of homes under construction was approximately 25000 and 24000 at september 30 2005 and 2004 respectively included in homes under construction at the end of both years were approximately 1600 model homes and less than 200 unsold homes that had been completed for more than six months 

seasonality 

  we experience seasonal variations in our quarterly operating results and capital requirements we typically have more homes under construction close more homes and have greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year in fiscal 2005 61 of our consolidated revenues and 63 of our consolidated operating income were attributable to operations in the third and fourth fiscal quarters this seasonal activity increases our working capital requirements for our homebuilding operations during the third and fourth fiscal quarters and increases our funding requirements for the mortgages we originate in our financial services segment at the end of these quarters because the cash generated from our homebuilding operations during these quarters is not available to our financial services segment we have employed the uncommitted accordion provisions of the segment’s credit facilities and sought other temporary commitment increases for this purpose any additional temporary financing for our mortgage operations is typically reduced during the first and second quarters of the succeeding fiscal year as we sell our related mortgage portfolio as a result our results of operations and financial position at the end of the third and fourth fiscal quarters are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year 

38 inflation 

  we and the homebuilding industry in general may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation primarily because of higher land financing labor and material construction costs in addition higher mortgage interest rates can significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers we attempt to pass through to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices and to date inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

forwardlooking statements 

  certain statements contained in this report as well as in other materials we have filed or will file with the securities and exchange commission statements made by us in periodic press releases and oral statements we make to analysts stockholders and the press in the course of presentations about us may be construed as “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 and the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 forwardlooking statements are based on management’s beliefs as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to management these forwardlooking statements typically include the words “anticipate” “believe” “consider” “estimate” “expect” “forecast” “goal” “intend” “objective” “plan” “projection” “seek” “strategy” “target” or other words of similar meaning any or all of the forwardlooking statements included in this report and in any other of our reports or public statements may not approximate actual experience and the expectations derived from them may not be realized due to unknown risks uncertainties and other factors as a result actual results may differ materially from the expectations or results we discuss in the forwardlooking statements these risks uncertainties and other factors include but are not limited to

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   we are subject to interest rate risk on our long term debt we monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and utilize both fixed and variable rate debt for fixed rate debt changes in interest rates generally affect the value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows conversely for variable rate debt changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument but may affect our future earnings and cash flows we have mitigated our exposure to changes in interest rates on our variable rate bank debt by entering into interest rate swap agreements to obtain a fixed interest rate for a portion of the variable rate borrowings we generally do not have an obligation to prepay 

39 fixedrate debt prior to maturity and as a result interest rate risk and changes in fair value would not have a significant impact on our fixedrate debt until such time as we are required to refinance repurchase or repay such debt 

  our interest rate swaps are not designated as hedges under sfas no 133 we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in the fair values of the swaps and such changes must be reflected in our income statements 

  our mortgage company is exposed to interest rate risk associated with its mortgage loan origination services interest rate lock commitments irlcs are extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and who meet defined credit and underwriting criteria typically the irlcs have a duration of less than six months some irlcs are committed immediately to a specific investor through the use of bestefforts whole loan delivery commitments while other irlcs are funded prior to being committed to thirdparty investors we manage interest rate risk related to uncommitted irlcs through the use of forward sales of mortgagebacked securities fmbs and the purchase of eurodollar futures contracts edfc on certain loan types fmbs and edfc related to irlcs are classified and accounted for as nondesignated derivative instruments with gains and losses recorded in current earnings fmbs and edfc related to funded uncommitted loans are designated as fair value hedges with changes in the value of the derivative instruments recognized in current earnings along with changes in the value of the funded uncommitted loans the effectiveness of the fair value hedges is continuously monitored and any ineffectiveness which for the years ended september 30 2005 2004 and 2003 was not significant is recognized in current earnings at september 30 2005 fmbs and edfc to mitigate interest rate risk related to uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale and uncommitted irlcs totaled 2530 million uncommitted irlcs the duration of which was less than six months totaled approximately 1308 million and uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale totaled approximately 884 million at september 30 2005 at september 30 2005 the fair value of the fmbs edfc and irlcs was an insignificant amount

   from 1978 to late 1987 our homebuilding activities were conducted in the dallas fort worth area we then began diversifying geographically by entering additional markets both through startup operations and acquisitions   we believe our diversification strategy mitigates the effects of local and regional economic cycles and enhances our growth potential typically we do not invest material amounts of capital in real estate including raw land developed lots models and speculative homes or overhead in startup operations in new markets until such markets demonstrate significant growth potential and acceptance of our products while we believe there are significant growth opportunities in our existing markets we also intend to continue our diversification strategy by seeking to enter new markets we continually monitor the sales margins and returns achieved in each of our markets as part of our evaluation of the use of our capital 

 

   we decentralize our homebuilding activities to give more operating flexibility to our local division presidents we have 42 separate operating divisions some of which are in the same market area and some of which operate in more than one market area generally each operating division consists of a division president land acquisition and development personnel a sales manager and sales personnel a construction manager and construction superintendents a controller a purchasing manager and office staff we believe that division presidents and their management teams who are intimately familiar with local conditions make better decisions regarding local operations our division presidents receive performance bonuses based upon achieving targeted financial measures in their operating divisions 

 

   each operating division is responsible for    — a feasibility study   — soil and environmental reviews   — review of existing zoning and other governmental requirements and   — review of the need for and extent of offsite work required to meet local building codes  

 

   we centralize the key risk elements of our homebuilding business through our regional and corporate offices we have six separate homebuilding operating regions each of which generally consists of a region 2 president legal counsel a chief financial officer and a purchasing manager each of our region presidents and their management teams are responsible for oversight of the operations of four to ten divisions including review and approval of division business plans and budgets review and approval of all land and lot acquisition contracts allocation of capital oversight of inventory levels and review of major personnel decisions and division president compensation plans 

  our corporate office departments are responsible for establishing our operational policies and internal control standards and monitoring compliance with established policies and controls throughout our operations the corporate office also has primary responsibility for direct management of certain key risk elements and initiatives through the following centralized functions  

 

   we control our overhead costs by centralizing certain administrative and accounting functions and by closely monitoring the number of administrative personnel and management positions in our operating divisions and our corporate office we also minimize advertising costs by actively participating in promotional activities sponsored by local real estate brokers and trade associations   we control construction costs by striving to efficiently design our homes by obtaining competitive bids for construction materials and labor and by negotiating favorable pricing from our primary subcontractors and suppliers based on the volume of services and products we purchase from them on a local regional and national basis we monitor our construction costs on each house through our purchasing and construction budgeting systems and we monitor our inventory levels margins returns and expenses through our management information systems 

 

   we have recently focused on internal growth however as an integral component of our operational strategy we continue to evaluate opportunities for strategic acquisitions we believe that expanding our operations through the acquisition of existing homebuilding companies affords us several benefits not found in startup operations such benefits include  3   in evaluating potential acquisition candidates we seek homebuilding companies that have excellent reputations track records of profitability and strong management teams we limit the risks associated with acquiring a going concern by conducting extensive operational financial and legal due diligence on each acquisition and by only acquiring homebuilding companies that we believe will have a positive impact on our earnings within one year we believe that our acquisition evaluation and due diligence processes and our decentralized operating approach with centralized controls have contributed to the successful integration of our prior acquisitions in the future we will continue to evaluate potential acquisition opportunities that satisfy our acquisition criteria in existing or new markets markets   we conduct our homebuilding operations in all of the geographic regions states and markets listed below and we conduct our mortgage and title operations in many of these markets as indicated in the following table  4   when evaluating the viability of new or existing homebuilding markets we consider the following factors among others    our homebuilding revenues from home sales by geographic region are    our homebuilding revenues from land and lot sales by geographic region are    the majority of our homebuilding inventories are concentrated in six states arizona california colorado florida nevada and texas land policies   typically we acquire land only after we have completed appropriate due diligence and after we have obtained the rights “entitlements” to begin development or construction work before we acquire lots or tracts of land we will among other things complete a feasibility study which includes soil tests independent environmental studies and other engineering work and determine that all necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements required to develop and use the property for home construction have been obtained although we purchase and develop land primarily to support our homebuilding activities occasionally we sell lots and land to other developers and homebuilders   we also enter into landlot option contracts in which we purchase the right but generally not the obligation to buy land or lots at predetermined prices on a defined schedule commensurate with 5 anticipated home closings or planned land development our option contracts generally are nonrecourse which limits our financial exposure to our earnest money deposited with land and lot sellers this enables us to control significant land and lot positions with minimal capital investment which substantially reduces the risks associated with land ownership and development 

  we limit our exposure to real estate inventory risks by  construction   our home designs are prepared by architects in each of our markets to appeal to local tastes and preferences of homebuyers in each community we also offer optional interior and exterior features to allow homebuyers to enhance the basic home design and to allow us to generate additional revenues from each home sold   substantially all of our construction work is performed by subcontractors our construction supervisors monitor the construction of each home participate in important design and building decisions coordinate the activities of subcontractors and suppliers review the work of subcontractors for quality and cost controls and monitor compliance with zoning and building codes subcontractors typically are retained for a specific subdivision pursuant to a contract that obligates the subcontractor to complete construction at a fixed price agreements with our subcontractors and suppliers generally are negotiated for each subdivision we compete with other homebuilders for qualified subcontractors raw materials and lots in the markets where we operate   construction time for our homes depends on the weather availability of labor materials and supplies size of the home and other factors we typically complete the construction of a home within four to six months   we do not maintain significant inventories of construction materials except for work in progress materials for homes under construction typically the construction materials used in our operations are readily available from numerous sources we have contracts exceeding one year with certain suppliers of our building materials that are cancelable at our option with a 30 day notice in recent years we have not experienced any significant delays in construction due to shortages of materials or labor marketing and sales   we market and sell our homes through commissioned employees and independent real estate brokers we typically conduct home sales from sales offices located in furnished model homes in each subdivision we generally do not offer our model homes for sale until the completion of a subdivision our sales personnel assist prospective homebuyers by providing them with floor plans price information tours of model homes and the selection of options and other custom features we train and inform our sales personnel as to the availability of financing construction schedules and marketing and advertising plans 6   we advertise in our local markets as necessary we advertise in newspapers and trade publications ie real estate broker mortgage company and utility publications as well as with marketing brochures and newsletters we also use billboards radio and television advertising and our internet website to market the location price range and availability of our homes to minimize advertising costs we also attempt to operate in subdivisions in conspicuous locations that permit us to take advantage of local traffic patterns we also believe that model homes play a significant role in our marketing efforts so we expend significant effort to create an attractive atmosphere in our model homes   in addition to using model homes we typically build a limited number of speculative homes in each subdivision to enhance our marketing and sales efforts to prospective homebuyers who are relocating to our markets and to independent brokers who often represent homebuyers requiring a completed home within 60 days we sell a majority of these speculative homes while they are under construction or immediately following completion we determine the number of speculative homes to build in each market based on local market factors such as new job growth the number of job relocations housing demand seasonality and our past experience in the market   our sales contracts require an earnest money deposit of at least 500 the amount of earnest money required varies between markets and subdivisions and may significantly exceed 500 additionally customers are generally required to pay additional deposits when they select options or upgrade features for their homes most of our sales contracts stipulate that when customers cancel their contracts with us we have the right to retain their earnest money and option deposits however our operating divisions occasionally choose to refund such deposits our sales contracts also include a financing contingency which permits customers to cancel and receive a refund of their deposits if they cannot obtain mortgage financing at prevailing or specified interest rates within a specified period and our contracts may include other contingencies such as the sale of an existing home generally the length of time between the signing of a sales contract for a home and delivery of the home to the buyer closing is three to six months customer service and quality control   our operating divisions are responsible for preclosing quality control inspections and responding to customers’ postclosing needs we believe that prompt and courteous response to homebuyers’ needs during and after construction reduces postclosing repair costs enhances our reputation for quality and service and ultimately leads to significant repeat and referral business from the real estate community and homebuyers we provide our homebuyers with a limited oneyear warranty on workmanship and building materials the subcontractors who perform most of the actual construction also provide us with warranties on workmanship and are generally prepared to respond to us and the homeowner promptly upon request in addition we provide a supplemental tenyear limited warranty that covers major construction defects customer mortgage financing   we provide mortgage financing services principally to purchasers of homes we build and sell in the majority of our homebuilding markets through our whollyowned subsidiary dhi mortgage dhi mortgage coordinates and expedites the entire sales transaction for both our homebuyers and our homebuilding operations by ensuring that mortgage commitments are received and that closings take place on a timely and efficient basis during the year ended september 30 2004 92 of dhi mortgage’s loan volume related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations and dhi mortgage provided mortgage financing services for approximately 61 of our total homes closed   dhi mortgage originates mortgage loans and then packages and sells substantially all of the loans and their servicing rights to thirdparty investors shortly after origination on a nonrecourse or limited recourse basis in markets where we currently do not provide mortgage financing we work with a variety of mortgage lenders that make available to homebuyers a range of mortgage financing programs 7 title services   we serve as a title insurance agent in selected markets by providing title insurance policies examination and closing services to purchasers of homes we build and sell through our subsidiary title companies we assume little or no underwriting risk associated with these title policies employees   at september 30 2004 we employed 7466 persons of whom 1420 were sales and marketing personnel 2571 were executive administrative and clerical personnel 2170 were involved in construction and 1305 worked in mortgage and title operations the company had fewer than 20 employees covered by collective bargaining agreements employees of some of the subcontractors which we use are represented by labor unions or are subject to collective bargaining agreements we believe that our relations with our employees and subcontractors are good competition   the homebuilding industry is highly competitive we compete in each of our markets with numerous other national regional and local homebuilders for homebuyers desirable properties raw materials skilled labor and financing our homes compete on the basis of quality price design mortgage financing terms and location governmental regulation and environmental matters   the homebuilding industry is subject to extensive and complex regulations we and our subcontractors must comply with various federal state and local laws and regulations including zoning density and development requirements building environmental advertising and real estate sales rules and regulations these requirements affect the development process as well as building materials to be used building designs and minimum elevation of properties our homes are inspected by local authorities where required and homes eligible for insurance or guarantees provided by the fha and va are subject to inspection by them these regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities this can delay or increase the cost of development or homebuilding   our new housing developments may be subject to various assessments for schools parks streets and other public improvements these assessments increase our development and homebuilding costs and can cause increases in the prices of our homes   our homebuilding operations are also subject to a variety of local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning protection of health and the environment the particular environmental laws for each site vary greatly according to location environmental condition and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties these environmental laws may result in delays may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs and may prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas   our mortgage company and title insurance agencies must also comply with various federal and state laws consumer credit rules and regulations and other rules and regulations unique to such activities additionally mortgage loans and title activities originated under the fha va gnma fannie mae and freddie mac are subject to rules and regulations imposed by those agencies

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition tableend critical accounting policies   general  — a comprehensive enumeration of the significant accounting policies of dr horton inc and subsidiaries is presented in note a to the accompanying financial statements as of september 30 2004 and 2003 and for the years ended september 30 2004 2003 and 2002 each of our accounting policies has been chosen based upon current authoritative literature that collectively comprises generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” for public companies operating in the united states of america in instances where alternative methods of accounting are permissible under gaap we have chosen the method that most appropriately reflects the nature of our business the results of our operations and our financial condition and have consistently applied those methods over each of the periods presented in the financial statements the audit committee of our board of directors has reviewed and approved the accounting policies selected   basis of presentation  — our financial statements include the accounts of dr horton inc and all of its whollyowned majorityowned and controlled subsidiaries all significant intercompany accounts transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation we have also consolidated certain variable interest entities from which we are purchasing lots under option purchase contracts under the requirements of interpretation no 46 issued by the financial accounting standards board “fasb”   segment information  — our reportable business segments consist of homebuilding and financial services our homebuilding segment derives the majority of its revenue from constructing and selling singlefamily housing in 21 states and 63 markets throughout the united states the financial services segment generates revenue by originating and selling mortgage loans and by collecting fees for title insurance and closing services in many of the same markets we have no foreign subsidiaries or operations   revenue recognition  — we recognize homebuilding revenues when a home closes and title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer virtually all of our homebuilding revenues are received in cash within a day or two of closing we include amounts in transit from title companies at the end of each reporting period in homebuilding cash when we execute sales contracts with our homebuyers or when we require advance payment from homebuyers for custom changes upgrades or options related to their homes we record the cash deposits received as liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are canceled we either retain or refund to the homebuyer deposits on canceled sales contracts depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract   we recognize financial services revenues associated with our title operations as homes are closed closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued all of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed we transfer all underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies to thirdparty insurers we recognize the majority of the revenues associated with our mortgage operations when the mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to thirdparty investors origination fees net of direct origination costs are deferred and recognized as revenues along with the associated gains and losses on the sales of the loans and related servicing rights when the loans are sold we sell all mortgage loans and related servicing rights to thirdparty investors   inventories and cost of sales  — we state inventories at the lower of historical cost or fair value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 144 in addition to the costs of direct land acquisition land development and home construction inventory costs include interest real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and home construction applicable direct overhead costs that we incur after development projects or homes are substantially complete such as utilities maintenance and cleaning are charged to selling general and administrative sga expense as incurred all indirect overhead costs such as compensation of construction superintendents sales personnel and division and region management advertising and builder’s risk insurance are charged to sga expense as incurred 13   we use the specific identification method for the purpose of accumulating home construction costs cost of sales for homes closed includes the specific construction costs of each home and all applicable land acquisition land development and related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each project any changes to the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial home closings in a project are generally allocated on a prorata basis to the remaining homes in the project   when a home is closed we generally have not yet paid and recorded all incurred costs necessary to complete the home each month we record as a liability and as a charge to cost of sales the amount we estimate will ultimately be paid related to completed homes that have been closed as of the end of that month we compare our home construction budgets to actual recorded costs to estimate the additional costs remaining to be paid on each closed home we monitor the accuracy of each month’s accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on closed homes in subsequent months to the amount we accrued although actual costs to be paid on closed homes in the future could differ from our current estimate our method has historically produced consistently accurate estimates of actual costs to complete closed homes   each quarter we review all components of our inventory for the purpose of determining whether recorded costs and costs required to complete each home or project are recoverable if our review indicates that an impairment loss is required under the sfas no 144 guidelines we estimate and record such loss to cost of sales in that quarter to date such impairment losses have been insignificant in the aggregate fair value estimation under sfas no 144 involves management estimates of future revenues and costs and due to uncertainties in the estimation process actual results could differ from such estimates   consolidation of variable interest entities  — in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” as amended “fin 46” fin 46 provides guidance for the financial accounting and reporting of interests in certain variable interest entities which fin 46 defines as certain business entities that either have equity investors with no voting rights or have equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entities to support their activities fin 46 requires consolidation of such entities by any company that is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the entities’ activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entities’ residual returns or both defined as the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity   in the ordinary course of business we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts in order to procure land or lots for the construction of homes under such option purchase contracts we will fund a stated deposit in consideration for the right but not the obligation to purchase land or lots at a future point in time with predetermined terms under the terms of the option purchase contracts many of our option deposits are nonrefundable certain nonrefundable deposits are deemed to create a variable interest in a variable interest entity under the requirements of fin 46 as such certain of our option purchase contracts result in the acquisition of a variable interest in the entity holding the land parcel under option   in applying the provisions of fin 46 we evaluate those land and lot option purchase contracts with variable interest entities to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary based upon analysis of the variability of the expected gains and losses of the entity based on this evaluation if we are the primary beneficiary of an entity with which we have entered into a land or lot option purchase contract the variable interest entity is consolidated   since we own no equity interest in any of the unaffiliated variable interest entities that we must consolidate pursuant to fin 46 we generally have little or no control or influence over the operations of these entities or their owners when our requests for financial information are denied by the land sellers certain assumptions about the assets and liabilities of such entities are required in most cases the fair value of the assets of the consolidated entities have been assumed to be the remaining contractual purchase price of the land or lots we are purchasing in these cases it is assumed that the entities have no debt obligations and the only asset recorded is the land or lots we have the option to buy with a related offset to minority interest for the assumed third party investment in the variable interest entity creditors if any of these variable interest entities have no recourse against us 14   warranty costs  — we have established warranty reserves by charging cost of sales and crediting a warranty liability for each home closed we estimate the amounts charged to be adequate to cover expected warrantyrelated costs for materials and labor required under one and tenyear warranty obligation periods the oneyear warranty is comprehensive for all parts and labor the tenyear period is for major construction defects our warranty cost accruals are based upon our historical warranty cost experience in each market in which we operate and are adjusted as appropriate to reflect qualitative risks associated with the type of homes we build and the geographic areas in which we build them actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts   insurance claim costs  — we have and require the majority of our subcontractors to have general liability and workers compensation insurance these insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims subject to certain selfinsured retentions deductibles and other coverage limits we reserve for costs to cover our selfinsured and deductible amounts under those policies and for any estimated costs of claims and lawsuits in excess of our coverage limits or not covered by our policies based on an analysis of our historical claims which includes an estimate of construction defect claims incurred but not yet reported projection of losses related to these liabilities is subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends in construction defect claims relative to our markets and the types of products we build claim settlement patterns insurance industry practices and legal interpretations among others because of the high degree of judgment required in determining these estimated reserve amounts actual future costs could differ significantly from our currently estimated amounts   interest rate swaps  — we have two interest rate swap agreements with a major united states bank under which we receive each quarter the london interbank offered rate libor and pay a fixed amount that averages 51 on a total notional amount of 200 million we entered into both of the tenyear swap contracts in 1998 because we were unwilling to “buy out” the bank’s current right to cancel each swap during any quarter in which libor exceeds 7 we chose not to designate the swaps as cashflow hedges under sfas no 133 as a result even though they still protect us to some extent from increases in variable interest rates associated with our revolving credit facility we are required to record the changes in their market value in our income statement each quarter at the end of each quarter the swaps’ market value will have changed depending upon the market’s current anticipation of quarterly libor rate levels from the present until the swaps’ maturity in 2008 the swaps’ market values generally vary directly with changes in anticipated future libor rates any future reductions in anticipated libor rates could result in corresponding future reductions in their market value and charges to our income statements similarly any future increases in anticipated libor rates could result in corresponding future increases in their market value and increases in our reported earnings we cannot predict the changes in either future libor rates or the market values of our swaps   goodwill  — we adopted sfas no 142 at the beginning of fiscal 2002 under its provisions we are no longer permitted to amortize goodwill to earnings such amounts are recorded on our balance sheet under the caption “goodwill” sfas no 142 requires companies to periodically assess recorded goodwill amounts for the purpose of determining whether any impairments have occurred and need to be recorded we have measured the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model and determined that the fair value of our reporting units is greater than their book value and therefore no impairment of goodwill exists we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining balance of goodwill may not be recoverable the goodwill assessment procedures required by sfas no 142 require management to make comprehensive estimates of future revenues and costs due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates actual results could differ from such estimates   stockbased compensation  — with the approval of a committee consisting of independent members of our board of directors we occasionally issue to employees options to purchase our common stock the committee approves grants only out of amounts remaining available for grant from amounts formally authorized by our common stockholders we grant approved options with strike prices equal to the market price of the common stock on the date of the option grant the majority of the options granted vest ratably over a tenyear period we account for options under the provisions of accounting principles board 15 apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and accordingly recognize no compensation expense for the grants sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” “sfas no 123” and sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation — transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 123” “sfas no 148” require us to disclose the effects on net income and diluted net income per share had we recorded compensation expense in accordance with sfas no 123 the sfas no 123 requirements applied only to options granted after its effective date 

  in march 2004 the fasb issued a proposed statement of financial accounting standard which would amend sfas no 123 and require companies that issue sharebased payments to record compensation expense based on the fair value of the sharebased payment we will adopt the proposed statement when it becomes effective and we do not expect this change in accounting principle to materially affect our results of operations in future periods 

results of operations — overview   we experienced significant increases in revenues and earnings during the fiscal years ended september 30 2004 and 2003 driven primarily by the continued growth of our homebuilding operations and by significant improvements in homebuilding profit margins   the demand from firsttime and moveup homebuyers has remained favorable population growth demographics immigration household formations and changes in home ownership rates were the primary longterm factors driving this housing demand with particular strength in our southeast southwest and west regions low mortgage rates were a positive influence on housing demand during 2004 and 2003 during a period of generally weak employment levels in addition because the homebuilding industry in the united states is highly fragmented we have been able to capitalize on the benefits of our size such as our capital strength and access to lower material labor and capital costs to generate continued growth by increasing market share   the mortgage industry was negatively impacted by a decline in loan refinancing activity during 2004 this resulted in increased competitive conditions and lower margins in the mortgage markets including the market for mortgage loans for new home construction   key financial highlights for our fiscal years ended september 30 2004 and 2003 were as follows

    our operating strategy for fiscal 2005 and future years is to take advantage of opportunities to grow our homebuilding business while continuing to generate profitability improvements and maintaining a strong balance sheet we plan to execute our growth strategy primarily by investing our available capital in our existing homebuilding markets through our capital allocation process

   the following tables set forth key operating and financial data for our homebuilding operations as of and for the fiscal years ended september 30 2004 and 2003   17  homebuilding operating margin analysis    net new sales orders represent the number and dollar value of new sales contracts executed with customers net of sales contract cancellations during the year the value of net new sales orders increased 24 to 114062 million 45263 homes in 2004 from 91623 million 38725 homes in 2003 the average price of a net new sales order in 2004 was 252000 up 7 from the 236600 average in 2003 the number of homes sold value and the average price of net new sales orders increased in each of our market regions during 2004 due to the successful execution of our growth strategies and generally strong demand for our homes in all of our market regions the largest increases in the value of net new sales orders occurred in the southeast and midatlantic regions which is a result of our efforts to significantly increase our presence in our florida virginia and maryland markets where housing demand is strong the increase in our average selling price reflects our ability to increase prices in the markets where demand for our homes is strongest while we continue our efforts to ensure that our product offerings and prices remain affordable for our target customers typically firsttime and moveup homebuyers in most of our markets   sales backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period some of which are subject to contingencies including mortgage loan approval that can result in cancellations in the past our backlog has been a reliable indicator of the level of future closings although contracts in backlog may not all result in closings at september 30 2004 the value of our backlog of sales orders was 45685 million 17184 homes up 25 from 36534 million 15488 homes at september 30 2003 the average sales price of homes in backlog was 265900 at september 30 2004 up 13 from the 235900 average at september 30 2003 the value of our sales backlog increased in four of our five market regions led by a 92 increase in the southeast region which is a result of our efforts to significantly increase our presence in our florida markets the average selling price of homes in backlog increased in all of our market regions reflecting the generally strong demand for our homes in fiscal 2004 which allowed us to increase prices   revenues from home sales increased 26 to 104911 million 43567 homes closed in 2004 from 83341 million 35934 homes closed in 2003 revenues from home sales increased by more than 20 18 in all of our five market regions and the number of homes closed increased by 15 or more in all market regions as well reflecting the successful execution of our growth strategies and our homebuilding divisions’ ability to efficiently deliver homes in backlog to homebuyers the average selling price of homes we closed during 2004 was 240800 up 4 from 231900 in 2003 the average selling price of homes closed increased in four of our five market regions with the largest increases occurring in the southeast and midatlantic regions 

  total homebuilding gross profit increased by 41 to 24607 million in 2004 from 17463 million in 2003 including sales of both homes and landlots total homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding revenues increased 27 percentage points to 231 in 2004 from 204 in 2003 gross profit from home sales as a percentage of home sales revenues increased 22 percentage points to 228 in 2004 from 206 in 2003 which is attributable to our ability to increase home prices due to strong demand for our homes in many of our markets and our ongoing efforts to control and reduce construction costs as we achieve greater economies of scale   selling general and administrative sga expenses from homebuilding activities increased by 17 to 9590 million in 2004 from 8170 million in 2003 as a percentage of revenues sga expenses decreased 06 percentage points to 90 in 2004 from 96 in 2003 the improvement in sga expenses as a percentage of revenues is attributable to our ongoing cost control efforts and our ability to generate higher revenue levels that better leverage our existing fixed sga costs   interest incurred related to homebuilding debt decreased by 1 to 2367 million in 2004 from 2395 million in 2003 our average homebuilding debt increased 5 in 2004 from 2003 however during the past two years we have replaced certain of our higher interest rate notes with notes bearing lower interest rates and we have restructured and amended our unsecured revolving credit facility which lowered our interest costs resulting in this slight decrease in interest incurred in 2004   we capitalize interest costs only to inventory under construction or development during both years our inventory under construction or development exceeded our interest bearing debt therefore we capitalized all interest from homebuilding debt except for the unamortized discounts and fees related to debt we paid off prior to maturity interest amortized to cost of sales increased by 13 to 2490 million in 2004 from 2194 million in 2003 this increase was attributable to a 20 increase in total cost of sales partially offset by the effects of the decline in interest incurred   other income associated with homebuilding activities was 99 million in 2004 compared to other expense of 94 million in 2003 the major component of other income in 2004 was an increase in the fair value of our interest rate swaps of 81 million the major component of other expense in 2003 was 118 million of minority interests in the income of our consolidated joint ventures

market regions with the largest percentage increases occurring in the west and southeast regions the overall increase in the value of net new sales orders was due to generally strong housing demand

new sales orders increased 23 to 84529 million and the number of net new sales orders increased 17 to 36706 homes the average price of a net new sales order in 2003 was 236600 up 8 over the 218700 average in 2002 the increase in average selling price was due primarily to the increase in net new sales orders in the west region to 33 of the total net new sales orders in 2003 from 31 of net new sales orders in 2002 in the west region average selling prices are higher than in any of our other market regions 20   at september 30 2003 the value of our backlog of sales orders was 36534 million

majority of our markets   revenues from home sales increased 28 to 83341 million 35934 homes closed in 2003 from 65296 million 29761 homes closed in 2002 revenues from home sales increased in all of our five market regions with the largest percentage increases occurring in the west and southeast regions the increases in both revenues and homes closed were due to generally strong housing demand throughout the majority of our markets and the acquisition of schuler excluding the fiscal 2003 activities of schuler prior to the february 21 2003 anniversary date of the acquisition home sales revenues increased 20 to 78560 million 34410 homes closed in 2003 from 65296 million 29761 homes closed in 2002   the average selling price of homes we closed during 2003 was 231900 up 6 from 219400 in 2002 the increase in average selling price was due primarily to the increase in homes closed in the west region to 34 of total homes closed in 2003 from 32 of homes closed in 2002 in the west region average selling prices are higher than in any of our other market regions   total homebuilding gross profit increased by 39 to 17463 million in 2003 from 12608 million in 2002 including sales of both homes and landlots total homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding revenues increased 14 percentage points to 204 in 2003 from 190 in 2002 gross profit from home sales as a percentage of home sales revenues increased 15 percentage points to 206 in 2003 from 191 in 2002 most of the costs associated with the sales of inventory acquired in the schuler acquisition with lower gross margins as a result of purchase accounting adjustments that increased the acquired inventory to its fair value as of the date of acquisition was recognized in 2002   selling general and administrative sga expenses from homebuilding activities increased by 26 to 8170 million in 2003 from 6468 million in 2002 as a percentage of revenues sga expenses decreased 02 percentage points to 96 in 2003 from 98 in 2002 the improvement in sga expenses as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to our cost control efforts and the increased leverage of fixed sga expenses achieved by the increase in homebuilding revenues   interest incurred related to homebuilding debt increased by 20 to 2395 million in 2003 from 1988 million in 2002 our average homebuilding debt increased 14 in 2003 from 2002 during 2003 we incurred a full year of interest associated with the homebuilding debt acquired in the schuler acquisition which is fixed rate debt with higher interest rates than most of our other debt   we capitalize interest costs only to inventory under construction or development during 2003 our inventory under construction or development exceeded our interest bearing debt therefore we capitalized all interest from homebuilding debt except for the unamortized discounts and fees related to debt we paid off prior to maturity during 2002 we expensed the portion of the interest related to interest bearing debt in excess of our inventory under construction or development interest amortized to cost of sales increased by 61 to 2194 million in 2003 from 1362 million in 2002 while total cost of sales increased only 27 in 2003 the disproportionately large increase in interest to total cost of sales in 2003 as compared to 2002 was attributable to the 2002 closings related to the schuler acquisition that had little or no capitalized interest associated with them   other expense associated with homebuilding activities was 94 million in 2003 compared to 169 million in 2002 the expense in 2003 is primarily due to 118 million of minority interests in the income of our consolidated joint ventures additionally 42 million of expense was recorded to writedown to estimated fair value the carrying amounts of our investments in startup and emerging growth companies which was offset by 36 million in interest income and a 18 million increase in the fair value of our interest rate swaps the expense in 2002 was primarily due to a 123 million decline in the fair 21 value of our interest rate swaps and a 66 million writedown to estimated fair value of the carrying amounts of our investments in startup and emerging growth companies 

results of operations — financial services 

 

     revenues from the financial services segment increased 4 to 1828 million in 2004 from 1760 million in 2003 the increase in financial services revenues was primarily due to an increase in the number of mortgage loan originations to customers of our homebuilding operations offset by a decline in the average mortgage revenues earned per loan the decrease in the average mortgage revenues earned per loan was primarily due to a shift in the product mix of mortgage loans originated and sold from higher margin fixedrate loans to lower margin adjustablerate loans and increased competition due to excess capacity in the mortgage industry which has reduced the margins on all mortgage loans   general and administrative expenses associated with financial services increased 23 to 1210 million in 2004 from 983 million in 2003 as a percentage of financial services revenues general and administrative expenses increased by 103 percentage points to 662 in 2004 from 559 in 2003 the increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of financial services revenue and the related decrease in income before income taxes were due primarily to the decline in average mortgage revenues earned per loan and increased costs associated with strengthening our financial services infrastructure to support our growing homebuilding business and expanding our mortgage operations into california 22 

 

     revenues from the financial services segment increased 55 to 1760 million in 2003 from 1136 million in 2002 the increase in financial services revenues was primarily due to an increase in the number of mortgage loan originations to customers of our homebuilding operations and an increase in the average mortgage revenues earned per loan   general and administrative expenses associated with financial services increased 45 to 983 million in 2003 from 678 million in 2002 as a percentage of financial services revenues general and administrative expenses decreased by 38 percentage points to 559 in 2003 from 597 in 2002 the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of financial services revenue and the related increase in income before income taxes were due primarily to efficiencies realized with the increase in revenues generated from the increase in mortgage loans originated and the increase in revenues earned per loan capital resources and liquidity   we fund our homebuilding and financial services operations with cash flows from operating activities borrowings under our bank credit facilities and the issuance of new debt or equity securities as we utilize our capital resources and liquidity to fund the growth of our operations we focus on maintaining strong balance sheet leverage ratios   at september 30 2004 our ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital was 389 an improvement of 11 percentage points from 400 at september 30 2003 homebuilding debt to total capital consists of homebuilding notes payable net of cash divided by total capital homebuilding notes payable net of cash 23 plus stockholders’ equity our stockholders’ equity to total assets ratio increased 25 percentage points to 441 at september 30 2004 from 416 at september 30 2003 

  we believe that we will be able to continue to fund our homebuilding and financial services operations and our future cash needs including debt maturities through a combination of our existing cash resources cash flows from operating activities our existing credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities through the public debt markets 

 

   cash  — at september 30 2004 our available homebuilding cash and cash equivalents amounted to 4801 million   bank credit facility — in march 2004 we restructured and amended our existing unsecured revolving credit facility increasing it to 10 billion and extending its maturity to march 25 2008 the new facility included a 350 million letter of credit subfacility and an uncommitted 250 million accordion feature that permitted an increase in the facility in june 2004 we exercised the accordion feature and obtained commitments from our lenders that increased the total size of the facility to 121 billion the facility is guaranteed by substantially all of our whollyowned subsidiaries other than our financial services subsidiaries   we had no outstanding cash borrowings on our homebuilding revolving credit facility at september 30 2004 and 2003 under the debt covenants associated with our revolving credit facility our additional homebuilding borrowing capacity under the facility is limited to the lesser of the unused portion of the facility 11 billion at september 30 2004 or an amount determined under a borrowing base arrangement under the borrowing base limitation the sum of our senior debt and the amount drawn on our revolving credit facility may not exceed certain percentages of the various categories of our unencumbered inventory at september 30 2004 the borrowing base arrangement would have limited our additional borrowing capacity from any source to 22 billion at september 30 2004 we were in compliance with all of the covenants limitations and restrictions that form a part of our public debt obligations and our bank revolving credit facility   shelf registration statements  — at september 30 2004 we had the capacity to issue new debt or equity securities amounting to 175 billion under our universal shelf registration statement after the october 2004 issuance of 250 million of 4 78 senior notes due 2010 our remaining capacity to issue new debt or equity securities was 15 billion also at september 30 2004 we had the capacity to issue approximately 225 million shares of common stock under our acquisition shelf registration statement to effect in whole or in part possible future business acquisitions 

 

   cash  — at september 30 2004 we had available financial services cash and cash equivalents of 379 million   mortgage warehouse loan facility  — in april 2004 our whollyowned mortgage company restructured and amended its mortgage warehouse loan facility increasing the facility to 300 million and extending its maturity to april 8 2005 this loan facility was amended on september 28 2004 for a 30day period temporarily increasing the facility to 350 million to provide for increased yearend closing volume at september 30 2004 we had borrowings of 2677 million outstanding under the mortgage warehouse facility   commercial paper conduit facility  — our whollyowned mortgage company also has a 300 million commercial paper conduit facility the “cp conduit facility” which expires on june 29 2006 the terms of the facility are renewable annually by the sponsoring banks at september 30 2004 2250 million had been drawn under the cp conduit facility 24   the mortgage warehouse loan facility and the cp conduit facility are not guaranteed by either the parent company or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt borrowings under both facilities are secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale the mortgage loans pledged to secure the cp conduit facility are used as collateral for asset backed commercial paper issued by multiseller conduits in the commercial paper market at september 30 2004 our total mortgage loans held for sale were 6233 million all mortgage company activities are financed with the mortgage warehouse facility the cp conduit facility or internally generated funds both of the financial services’ credit facilities contain financial covenants with which we are in compliance 

 

   during the year ended september 30 2004 we used 4225 million of cash in our operating activities as compared to 4233 million of cash provided by operations during the prior year resulting in net cash provided from operating activities of 08 million for the two years ended september 30 2004   both the net cash used in operations in fiscal 2004 and the net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2003 were the result of cash provided from net income and increases in accounts payable and other liabilities offset by cash used to increase inventories mortgage loans held for sale and other assets reflecting the growth of our homebuilding and financial services operations the variance in operating cash flows from 2003 to 2004 is a direct result of our decision to invest 14 billion of cash to fund inventory growth in fiscal 2004 versus a 05 billion cash investment in inventory growth in fiscal 2003   a large portion of our cash invested in inventories represents purchases of land and lots that will be used to generate revenues and cash flows in future years since we control the amounts and timing of our investments in land and lots based on our inventory growth goals and our market opportunities we believe that cash flows from operating activities before inventory additions is currently a better indicator of our liquidity 

 

   in fiscal 2004 and 2003 cash used in investing activities represented net purchases of property and equipment primarily model home furniture and office equipment such purchases are not significant relative to our total assets or cash flows and they typically do not vary significantly from year to year 

 

   the majority of our shortterm financing needs are funded with cash generated from operations and funds available under our homebuilding and financial services credit facilities longterm financing needs are generally funded with the issuance of new senior unsecured debt securities through the public capital markets our homebuilding senior and senior subordinated notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our whollyowned subsidiaries other than our financial services subsidiaries   in january 2004 we issued 200 million of 5 senior notes due 2009 on june 15 2004 we used the majority of the proceeds of the issue to repay at maturity the 150 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 8 38 senior notes   in july 2004 we issued 200 million of 6 18 senior notes due 2014 in september 2004 we issued 250 million of 5 58 senior notes due 2014 we used the proceeds from both of these offerings to reduce borrowings under our revolving credit facility   in october 2004 we issued 250 million of 4 78 senior notes due 2010 we used the proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes including land acquisition and development home construction and homebuilding operations and other working capital needs   during fiscal 2004 our board of directors declared one quarterly cash dividend of 0047 per common share splitadjusted and three quarterly cash dividends of 008 per common share the last of which was paid on august 20 2004 to stockholders of record on august 6 2004 on october 14 2004 25 our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 008 per common share which was paid on november 2 2004 to stockholders of record on october 26 2004 

 

   on december 1 2003 our board of directors declared a threefortwo common stock split effected as a 50 stock dividend which was paid on january 12 2004 to stockholders of record on december 22 2003   on july 31 2003 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 200 million of our common stock and up to 200 million of our outstanding debt securities as market conditions warrant as of september 30 2004 and 2003 we had 1756 million remaining of the board of directors’ authorization for repurchases of common stock and 200 million remaining of the authorization for repurchases of debt securities 

 

   our primary contractual cash obligations for our homebuilding and financial services segments are payments under shortterm and longterm debt agreements and lease payments under operating leases purchase obligations of our homebuilding segment represent specific performance requirements under lot option purchase agreements that may require us to purchase land contingent upon the land seller meeting certain obligations we expect to fund our contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business through our operating cash flows our homebuilding and financial services credit facilities and by issuing senior notes   our future cash requirements for contractual obligations as of september 30 2004 are presented below    at september 30 2004 our homebuilding operations had outstanding letters of credit of 1338 million and surety bonds of 13677 million issued by third parties to secure performance under various contracts we expect that our performance obligations secured by these letters of credit and bonds will generally be completed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms when we complete our performance obligations the related letters of credit and bonds are generally released shortly thereafter leaving us with no continuing obligations we have no material thirdparty guarantees   to meet the financing needs of our customers our mortgage operations extend interest rate lock commitments “irlcs” to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and meet defined credit and underwriting criteria typically the irlcs have a duration of less than six months some irlcs are 26 committed immediately to a specific investor through the use of bestefforts whole loan delivery commitments while other irlcs are funded prior to being committed to thirdparty investors 

  we manage interest rate risk related to our uncommitted irlcs through the use of forward sales of mortgagebacked securities “fmbs” and the infrequent purchase of options on financial instruments as of september 30 2004 our irlcs totaled 5628 million and we had approximately 1170 million outstanding of fmbs and 4326 million of best efforts whole loan delivery commitments related to our irlcs offbalance sheet arrangements   in the ordinary course of business we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts in order to procure land or lots for the construction of homes lot option contracts enable us to control significant lot positions with a minimal capital investment and substantially reduce the risks associated with land ownership and development at september 30 2004 we had 2514 million in deposits to purchase land and lots with a total remaining purchase price of 49 billion of which only 1281 million is subject to specific performance clauses which may require us to purchase the land or lots upon the land seller meeting certain obligations pursuant to fin 46 we consolidated certain variable interest entities with assets of 1537 million land and lot position and homes in inventory   at september 30 2004 we controlled approximately 268000 lots 59 of which were lots under option or similar contracts the following is a summary of our landlot position at september 30    the percentage of our lots controlled under option contracts increased during 2004 as our operating divisions used our position as a large national homebuilder to negotiate favorable land acquisition terms that utilize our capital efficiently and mitigate our land ownership risks   at september 30 2004 we had a total of approximately 24000 homes under construction including approximately 1600 model homes and less than 200 unsold homes that had been completed for more than six months at september 30 2003 we had a total of approximately 21000 homes under construction including approximately 1450 model homes and less than 300 unsold homes that had been completed for more than six months inflation   we and the homebuilding industry in general may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation primarily because of higher land financing labor and material construction costs in addition higher mortgage interest rates can significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers we attempt to pass through to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices and to date inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations however there is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations 27 safe harbor statement and risks   certain statements contained in this report as well as in other materials we have filed or will file with the securities and exchange commission statements made by us in periodic press releases and oral statements we make to analysts stockholders and the press in the course of presentations about us may be construed as “forwardlooking statements” as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 these forwardlooking statements typically include the words “anticipate” “believe” “estimate” “expect” “forecast” “goal” “intend” “objective” “plan” “projection” “seek” “strategy” or other words of similar meaning any or all of the forwardlooking statements included in this report and in any other of our reports or public statements may not approximate actual experience and the expectations derived from them may not be realized due to known or unknown risks and uncertainties as a result actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in and anticipated by the forwardlooking statements the following cautionary discussion of risks and uncertainties relevant to our business includes factors we believe could adversely affect us other factors beyond those listed below could also adversely affect us  28    we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise however any further disclosures made on related subjects in subsequent reports on forms 10k 10q and 8k should be consulted

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   we are subject to interest rate risk on our long term debt we monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and utilize both fixed and variable rate debt for fixed rate debt changes in interest rates generally affect the value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows conversely for variable rate debt changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument but may affect our future earnings and cash flows we have mitigated our exposure to changes in interest rates on our variable rate bank debt by entering into interest rate swap agreements to obtain a fixed interest rate for a portion of the variable rate borrowings we generally do not have an obligation to prepay fixedrate debt prior to maturity and as a result interest rate risk and changes in fair value would not have a significant impact on our fixedrate debt until such time as we are required to refinance repurchase or repay such debt 29   our interest rate swaps were not designated as hedges under sfas no 133 when it was adopted on october 1 2000 we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in the fair values of the swaps and such changes must be reflected in our income statements   our mortgage company is exposed to interest rate risk associated with its mortgage loan origination services interest rate lock commitments irlcs are extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and who meet defined credit and underwriting criteria typically the irlcs have a duration of less than six months some irlcs are committed immediately to a specific investor through the use of bestefforts whole loan delivery commitments while other irlcs are funded prior to being committed to thirdparty investors forward sales of mortgagebacked securities “fmbs” are used to protect uncommitted irlcs against the risk of changes in interest rates fmbs related to irlcs are classified and accounted for as nondesignated derivative instruments with gains and losses recorded in current earnings fmbs related to funded uncommitted loans are designated as fair value hedges with changes in the value of the derivative instruments recognized in current earnings along with changes in the value of the funded uncommitted loans the effectiveness of the fair value hedges is continuously monitored and any ineffectiveness which for the years ended september 30 2004 2003 and 2002 was not significant is recognized in current earnings at september 30 2004 total fmbs to mitigate interest rate risk related to uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale and uncommitted irlcs totaled 1440 million uncommitted irlcs totaled approximately 1301 million the duration of which was less than six months and uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale totaled approximately 276 million at september 30 2004 the fair value of the fmbs and irlcs was an insignificant amount   the following table sets forth as of september 30 2004 for our debt obligations principal cash flows by scheduled maturity weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value in addition the table sets forth the notional amounts weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value of our interest rate swaps  30 index to consolidated financial statements  31 report of independent registered public accounting firm the board of directors dr horton inc

   from 1978 to late 1987 excluding locations acquired in our 1998 merger with continental homes our homebuilding activities were conducted in the dallas fort worth area we then instituted a strategy of diversifying geographically entering the following of our current markets both through startup operations and acquisitions in the years shown    we continually monitor the sales and margins achieved in each of the subdivisions in which we operate as part of our evaluation of the use of our capital while we believe there are significant growth opportunities in our existing markets we also intend to continue our policy of diversification by seeking to enter new markets we believe our diversification strategy mitigates the effects of local and regional economic cycles and enhances our growth potential typically we will not invest material amounts in real estate including raw land developed lots models and speculative homes or overhead in startup operations in new markets until such markets demonstrate significant growth potential and acceptance of our products 

 

   we are currently focusing on internal growth however as an integral component of our operational strategy of continued expansion we are continuing our historical approach of evaluating opportunities for strategic acquisitions in the future we believe that expanding our operations through the acquisition of 2 existing homebuilding companies has afforded us several benefits not found in startup operations such benefits include 

   in evaluating potential acquisition candidates we have sought homebuilding companies that have an excellent reputation a track record of profitability and a strong management team with an entrepreneurial orientation we have limited the risks associated with acquiring a going concern by conducting extensive operational financial and legal due diligence on each acquisition and by only acquiring homebuilding companies that we believe will have an immediate positive impact on our earnings in the last ten fiscal years we have made 17 acquisitions in the future we may resume acquisitions of homebuilders that satisfy our acquisition criteria in existing or new markets 

 

   we decentralize our homebuilding activities to give more operating flexibility to our local division presidents we have 43 separate operating divisions some of which operate in the same market area and some of which operate in more than one market area generally each operating division consists of a division president a land acquisition manager a sales manager and sales personnel a construction manager and construction superintendents a controller a purchasing manager and office staff we believe that division presidents who are intimately familiar with local conditions make better decisions regarding local operations our division presidents receive performance bonuses based upon achieving targeted operating levels in their operating divisions 

 

   each operating division is responsible for    — a feasibility study   — soil and environmental reviews   — review of existing zoning and other governmental requirements and   — review of the need for and extent of offsite work required to meet local building codes  

 

   the corporate office controls key risk elements through centralized  3  

 

   we control our overhead costs by centralized administrative and accounting functions and by limiting the number of field administrative personnel and middle level management positions we also minimize advertising costs by participating in promotional activities publications and newsletters sponsored by local real estate brokers mortgage companies utility companies and trade associations   we control construction costs through the efficient design of our homes and by obtaining favorable pricing from certain subcontractors and national vendors based on the high volume of services and products they provide us we also control construction costs by monitoring costs on each house through our purchase order system we control capital and overhead costs by monitoring our inventory levels through our management information systems markets   we conduct homebuilding activities in five geographic regions consisting of    when entering new markets or conducting operations in existing markets among the things we consider are  4   our homebuilding revenues which include land and lot sales by geographic region are  land policies   typically we acquire land only after necessary “entitlements” have been obtained ie when we have the right to begin development or construction before we acquire lots or tracts of land we will among other things complete a feasibility study which includes soil tests independent environmental studies and other engineering work and determine that all necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements required to develop and use the property for home construction have been acquired although we purchase and develop land primarily to support our own homebuilding activities occasionally we sell lots and land to other developers and homebuilders   we also use lot option contracts in which we purchase the right but not the obligation to buy building lots at predetermined prices on a takedown schedule commensurate with anticipated home closings lot option contracts generally are on a nonrecourse basis thereby limiting our financial exposure to earnest money deposits given to property sellers this enables us to control significant lot positions with a minimal capital investment and substantially reduces the risks associated with land ownership and development at september 30 2003 about 51 of our total lot position of 179370 lots was under option contracts   the following is a summary of our landlot positions at september 30 2003    we limit our exposure to real estate inventory risks by  5 construction   our home designs are prepared by architects in each of our markets to appeal to local tastes and preferences of the community we also offer optional interior and exterior features to enhance the basic home design and to promote our sales efforts   substantially all of our construction work is performed by subcontractors our construction supervisors monitor the construction of each home participate in important design and building decisions coordinate the activities of subcontractors and suppliers subject the work of subcontractors to quality and cost controls and monitor compliance with zoning and building codes subcontractors typically are retained for a specific subdivision pursuant to a contract that obligates the subcontractor to complete construction at a fixed price agreements with our subcontractors and suppliers generally are negotiated for each subdivision we compete with other homebuilders for qualified subcontractors raw materials and lots in the markets where we operate   construction time for our homes depends on the weather availability of labor materials and supplies size of the home and other factors we typically complete the construction of a home within four months   we do not maintain significant inventories of construction materials except for work in process materials for homes under construction typically the construction materials used in our operations are readily available from numerous sources we have contracts exceeding one year with certain suppliers of our building materials that are cancellable at our option with a 30 day notice in recent years we have not experienced any significant delays in construction due to shortages of materials or labor marketing and sales   we market and sell our homes through commissioned employees and independent real estate brokers we typically conduct home sales from sales offices located in furnished model homes in each subdivision at september 30 2003 we owned 1453 model homes which we generally do not offer for sale until the completion of a subdivision our sales personnel assist prospective home buyers by providing them with floor plans price information tours of model homes and the selection of options and other custom features we train and inform our sales personnel as to the availability of financing construction schedules and marketing and advertising plans   in addition to using model homes we typically build a limited number of speculative homes in each subdivision to enhance our marketing and sales activities construction of these speculative homes also is necessary to satisfy the requirements of relocated personnel and independent brokers who often represent home buyers requiring a completed home within 60 days we sell a majority of these speculative homes while they are under construction or immediately following completion the number of speculative homes is influenced by local market factors such as new employment opportunities significant job relocations growing housing demand and the length of time we have built in the market depending upon the seasonality of each market we attempt to limit our speculative homes in each subdivision at september 30 2003 we averaged less than six speculative homes in various stages of construction in each subdivision   we advertise on a limited basis in newspapers and in real estate broker mortgage company and utility publications brochures newsletters and on billboards in addition we use our internet website to market the location price range and availability of our homes to minimize advertising costs we attempt to operate in subdivisions in conspicuous locations that permit us to take advantage of local traffic patterns we also believe that model homes play a significant role in our marketing efforts consequently we expend significant effort in creating an attractive atmosphere in our model homes   our sales contracts require a down payment of at least 500 the contracts include a financing contingency which permits customers to cancel if they cannot obtain mortgage financing at prevailing interest rates within a specified period typically four to six weeks and may include other contingencies such as the sale of an existing home we include a home sale in our sales backlog when the sales contract is signed and we have received the initial down payment we recognize revenue from the sale of a home only when it is closed and title passes to the home buyer the average period between the signing of a sales contract for a home and closing is approximately three to five months 6 customer service and quality control   our operating divisions are responsible for preclosing quality control inspections and responding to customers’ postclosing needs we believe that prompt and courteous response to home buyers’ needs during and after construction reduces postclosing repair costs enhances our reputation for quality and service and ultimately leads to significant repeat and referral business from the real estate community and home buyers we provide our home buyers with a limited oneyear warranty on workmanship and building materials the subcontractors who perform most of the actual construction also provide us with warranties on workmanship and are generally prepared to respond to us and the homeowner promptly upon request in addition we provide a supplemental tenyear limited warranty that covers major construction defects customer financing   we provide mortgage financing services principally to purchasers of homes we build and sell ch mortgage a whollyowned subsidiary provides mortgage banking services in arizona california colorado florida georgia hawaii illinois maryland minnesota nevada new mexico north carolina oregon south carolina texas virginia and washington during the year ended september 30 2003 in the markets served our combined mortgage banking entities provided mortgage financing services for approximately 73 of the homes closed that required mortgage financing an increase from 72 during the year ended september 30 2002   in other markets where we currently do not provide mortgage financing we work with a variety of mortgage lenders that make available to home buyers a range of conventional mortgage financing programs by making information about these programs available to prospective home buyers and maintaining a relationship with such mortgage lenders we are able to coordinate and expedite the entire sales transaction by ensuring that mortgage commitments are received and that closings take place on a timely and efficient basis title services   through our subsidiaries century title custom title drh title company of texas ltd drh title company of florida inc drh title company of minnesota inc grande title agency llc metro title company and travis county title company we serve as a title insurance agent by providing title insurance policies examination and closing services to purchasers of homes we build in the atlanta austin dallas fort worth houston marylanddc miami west palm beach minneapolis new jersey orlando phoenix san antonio and virginiadc markets we assume no underwriting risk associated with these title policies employees   at september 30 2003 we employed 6348 persons of whom 1345 were sales and marketing personnel 2138 were executive administrative and clerical personnel 1767 were involved in construction and 1098 worked in mortgage and title operations the company had fewer than 25 employees covered by collective bargaining agreements employees of some of the subcontractors which we use are represented by labor unions or are subject to collective bargaining agreements we believe that our relations with our employees and subcontractors are good competition   the single family residential housing industry is highly competitive and we compete in each of our markets with numerous other national regional and local homebuilders our homes compete on the basis of quality price design mortgage financing terms and location governmental regulation and environmental matters   the housing mortgage and title insurance industries are subject to extensive and complex regulations we and our subcontractors must comply with various federal state and local laws and regulations including 7 zoning density and development requirements building environmental advertising and consumer credit rules and regulations as well as other rules and regulations in connection with our development homebuilding sales and financial services activities these include requirements affecting the development process as well as building materials to be used building designs and minimum elevation of properties our homes are inspected by local authorities where required and homes eligible for insurance or guarantees provided by the fha and va are subject to inspection by them these regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities this can delay or increase the cost of development or homebuilding 

  we also are subject to a variety of local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning protection of health and the environment the particular environmental laws for each site vary greatly according to location environmental condition and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties these environmental laws may result in delays may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas   our internal mortgage activities and title insurance agencies must also comply with various federal and state laws consumer credit rules and regulations and other rules and regulations unique to such activities additionally mortgage loans and title activities originated under the fha va fnma and gnma are subject to rules and regulations imposed by those agencies

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition tableend critical accounting policies   general  — a comprehensive enumeration of the significant accounting policies of dr horton inc and subsidiaries is presented in note a to the accompanying financial statements as of september 30 2003 and 2002 and for the years ended september 30 2003 2002 and 2001 each of our accounting policies has been chosen based upon current authoritative literature that collectively comprises generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” for public companies operating in the united states of america in instances where alternative methods of accounting are permissible under gaap we have chosen the method that most appropriately reflects the nature of our business the results of our operations and our financial condition and have consistently applied those methods over each of the periods presented in the financial statements the audit committee of our board of directors has reviewed and approved the accounting policies selected   basis of presentation  — our financial statements include the accounts of dr horton inc and all of its majorityowned or controlled subsidiaries all significant intercompany accounts transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation we have also consolidated certain variable interest entities from which we are purchasing lots under option purchase contracts under the requirements of interpretation no 46 issued by the financial accounting standards board “fasb”   segment information  — our reportable business segments consist of homebuilding and financial services our homebuilding segment derives the majority of its revenue from constructing and selling singlefamily housing in 20 states and 47 markets throughout the united states the financial services segment generates revenue by originating and selling mortgage loans and by collecting fees for title insurance and closing services in many of the same markets we have no foreign subsidiaries or operations   revenue recognition  — we recognize homebuilding revenues when a home closes and title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer virtually all of our homebuilding revenues are received in cash within a day or two of closing we include amounts in transit from title companies at the end of each reporting period in homebuilding cash when we execute a sales contract with our home buyers or when we require advance payment from home buyers for custom changes upgrades or options related to their homes we record the cash deposits as liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are canceled we either retain or refund to the home buyer deposits on canceled sales contracts depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract   we recognize financial services revenues associated with our title operations as homes are closed closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued all of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed we recognize the majority of the revenues associated with our mortgage loan operations when the mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to thirdparty investors we earn mortgage loan origination fees when we close and fund the loans associated with the homes financed we defer the earned origination fees net of direct origination costs and recognize them as revenues along with the associated gains or losses on the sales of the loans and related servicing rights when the loans are sold to thirdparty investors all of the financial services mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to thirdparty investors all of the underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies is transferred to thirdparty insurers   inventories  — we use the specific identification method for the purpose of accumulating costs associated with home construction we state inventories at the lower of historical cost or fair value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 144 in addition to the costs of direct land acquisition land development and home construction inventory costs include interest real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and home construction applicable direct overhead costs that we incur after development projects or homes are substantially complete are charged to selling general and administrative sga expense as incurred all indirect overhead costs such as construction superintendents’ compensation advertising and builder’s risk insurance are either charged to sga expense as incurred or in the case of builder’s risk insurance amortized to sga expense over the applicable policy periods 11   we amortize to cost of sales for homes closed all applicable land acquisition land development and related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each project any changes to the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial home closings in a project are generally allocated on a prorata basis to the remaining homes in the project   when a home is closed we usually have not yet recorded and paid all incurred costs necessary to complete the home each month we record as a liability and as a charge to cost of sales the amount we estimate will ultimately be paid related to completed homes that have been closed as of the end of that month we compare our home construction budgets to actual recorded costs to estimate the additional costs needed to complete each closed home we monitor the accuracy of each month’s accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on closed homes in subsequent months to the amount we accrued although actual costs to complete in the future could differ from our current estimate our method has historically produced consistently accurate estimates of actual costs to complete closed homes   each quarter we review all components of our inventory for the purpose of determining whether recorded costs and costs required to complete each home or project are recoverable if our review indicates that an impairment loss is required under the sfas no 144 guidelines we estimate and record such loss to cost of sales in that quarter to date such impairment losses have occurred primarily in markets that we have chosen to abandon and have been insignificant in the aggregate fair value estimation under sfas no 144 involves management estimates of future revenues and costs and due to uncertainties in the estimation process actual results could differ from such estimates   warranty costs  — warranty reserves have been established by charging cost of sales and crediting a warranty liability for each home closed the amounts charged are estimated by management to be adequate to cover expected warrantyrelated costs for materials and labor required under one and tenyear warranty obligation periods the oneyear warranty is comprehensive for all parts and labor the tenyear period is for major construction defects our warranty cost accruals are based upon our historical warranty cost experience in each market in which we operate and are adjusted as appropriate to reflect qualitative risks associated with the type of homes we build and the geographic areas in which we build them actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts   litigation reserves  — litigation reserves have been established for estimated amounts based on an actuarial analysis of our past history of claims we have and require the majority of our subcontractors to have general liability insurance that protects us against a portion of our risk of loss from constructionrelated claims we reserve for costs to cover our selfinsured retentions and deductible amounts under those policies and for any costs in excess of our coverage limits because of the high degree of judgment required in determining these estimated reserve amounts actual future litigation costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts   interest rate swaps  — we have two interest rate swap agreements with a major united states bank under which we receive each quarter the london interbank offered rate libor and pay a fixed amount that averages 51 on a total notional amount of 200 million we entered into both of the tenyear swap contracts in 1998 because we were unwilling to “buy out” the bank’s current right to cancel each swap during any quarter in which libor exceeds 7 we chose not to designate the swaps as cashflow hedges under sfas no 133 which we adopted on october 1 2000 as a result even though they still protect us to some extent from increases in variable interest rates associated with our revolving credit facility we are required to record the changes in their market value in our income statement each quarter at the end of each quarter the swaps’ market value will have changed depending upon the market’s current anticipation of quarterly libor rate levels from the present until the swaps’ maturity in 2008 the swaps’ market values generally vary directly with changes in anticipated future libor rates we recorded a gain of 18 million during this fiscal year which reduced the liability associated with our interest rate swaps to 208 million at september 30 2003 from 226 million at september 30 2002 the liability is a result of declines in short term interest rates in past years that resulted in a decline in the swaps’ market value we cannot predict the changes in either future libor rates or the market values of our swaps any future reductions in anticipated libor rates could result in corresponding future reductions in their market value and charges to our income statements 12 similarly any future increases in anticipated libor rates could result in corresponding future increases in their market value and increases in our reported earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 due to increases in anticipated libor rates their market value increased by 41 million requiring us to record an increase in earnings before income taxes of that amount by their maturity in 2008 the swaps’ market values will be zero so all of the current 208 million liability will have been added back to earnings by then offsetting at least partially any amounts we will have been required to pay to the counterparty during that time 

  goodwill  — we adopted sfas no 142 at the beginning of fiscal 2002 under its provisions we are no longer permitted to amortize goodwill to earnings such amounts are recorded on our balance sheet under the caption “excess of cost over net assets acquired” and in our homebuilding segment totaled 5789 million at september 30 2003 sfas no 142 requires companies to periodically assess recorded goodwill amounts for the purpose of determining whether any impairments have occurred and need to be recorded we have measured the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model and determined that the fair value of our reporting units was greater than their book value and therefore no impairment of goodwill existed we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining balance of goodwill may not be recoverable the goodwill assessment procedures required by sfas no 142 require management to make comprehensive estimates of future revenues and costs and due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates actual results could differ from such estimates   stockbased compensation  — with the approval of a committee consisting of independent members of our board of directors we occasionally issue to employees options to purchase our common stock the committee approves grants only out of amounts remaining available for grant from amounts formally authorized by our common stockholders we grant approved options with strike prices equal to the market price of the common stock on the date of the option grant the majority of the options granted vest ratably over a tenyear period we account for options under the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and accordingly recognize no compensation expense for the grants sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” “sfas no 123” and sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation — transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 123” “sfas no 148” require us to disclose the effects on net income and diluted net income per share had we recorded compensation expense in accordance with sfas no 123 the sfas no 123 requirements applied only to options granted after its effective date if we had used the blackscholes formula for valuing option grants made after our adoption of sfas no 123 our net income would have been 23 million 27 million and 43 million less than reported amounts for fiscal 2001 2002 and 2003 respectively and diluted net income per share would have been 002 less than the reported amounts for fiscal 2001 and 2002 and 003 less in fiscal 2003 for the present we have chosen to continue our current method of accounting for stock options until the fasb andor the securities and exchange commission “sec” have formalized and revised requirements for accounting for stock options when they do we will promptly adopt whatever new accounting methods are required   consolidation of variable interest entities  — in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” “fin 46” fin 46 provides guidance for the financial accounting and reporting of interests in certain variable interest entities fin 46 clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 51 “consolidated financial statements” to certain business entities that either have equity investors with no voting rights or have equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entities to support their activities fin 46 requires consolidation of such entities by any company that is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the entities’ activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entities’ residual returns or both we have chosen to fully adopt the provisions of fin 46 for all variable interest entities as of september 30 2003   in the ordinary course of business we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts in order to procure land or lots for the construction of homes under such option purchase contracts we will fund a stated deposit in consideration for the right to purchase land or lots at a future point in time with predetermined terms under the terms of the option purchase contracts most of our option deposits are nonrefundable certain nonrefundable deposits are deemed to create a variable interest in a variable interest entity under the 13 requirements of fin 46 as such certain of our option purchase contracts result in the acquisition of a variable interest in the entity holding the land parcel under option 

  the land sellers are not required to provide to us the financial information of the variable interest entities therefore when our requests for financial information are denied by the land sellers certain assumptions about the assets and liabilities are required in most cases the fair value of the assets of the consolidated entities have been assumed to be the contractual purchase price of the land or lots we are buying in these cases the only asset the entity is assumed to hold is the land or lots that we are buying with the related offset being recorded as minority interest for the assumed third party investment in the variable interest entity creditors if any of these variable interest entities have no recourse against us results of operations — consolidated   we provide homebuilding services in 20 states and 47 markets through our 43 homebuilding divisions through our financial services operations we also provide mortgage banking and title agency services in many of these same markets on february 21 2002 schuler homes inc “schuler” merged into dr horton inc with dr horton inc continuing as the surviving corporation 

 

   consolidated revenues increased 295 to 87281 million in 2003 from 67388 million in 2002 primarily due to increases in both home sales and financial services revenues approximately 4988 million of the increase in homebuilding revenues was attributable to fiscal 2003 revenues generated by schuler prior to the february 21 2003 anniversary date of the acquisition   income before income taxes increased 557 to 10082 million in 2003 from 6475 million in 2002 as a percentage of revenues income before income taxes increased 20 percentage points to 116 from 96 in 2002 factors contributing to that improvement were a 14 percentage point increase in homebuilding gross margins a 02 percentage point improvement in homebuilding sga expenses as a percentage of revenues and improved operating margins in our financial services segment   the consolidated provision for income taxes increased 574 to 3822 million in 2003 from 2428 million in 2002 due to the corresponding increase in income before income taxes the effective income tax rate for fiscal year 2003 was 379 04 percentage points higher than the 375 rate of fiscal 2002 due primarily to increases in pretax income in states with higher tax rates 

 

   consolidated revenues increased 512 to 67388 million in 2002 from 44555 million in 2001 primarily due to increases in both home sales and financial services revenues the increase in home sales revenues was attributable in part to 15072 million in revenues generated by fortressflorida acquired in may 2001 emerald builders acquired in july 2001 and schuler homes inc acquired in february 2002 during the periods in 2002 that were less than one year after each was acquired   income before income taxes increased 588 to 6475 million in 2002 from 4078 million in 2001 as a percentage of revenues income before income taxes increased 04 percentage points to 96 from 92 in 2001 factors contributing to that improvement were reductions in homebuilding other expense a 01 percentage point improvement in homebuilding sga expenses as a percentage of revenues a significantly improved operating margin in our financial services segment all offset in part by a 05 percentage point decline in our homebuilding gross margins the decline in the homebuilding gross margin was due primarily to sales of inventory acquired in the schuler acquisition that had lower gross margins as a result of purchase accounting adjustments that increased the acquired inventory to its fair value as of the date of the acquisition if the acquired inventory had been recorded at schuler’s historical cost rather than adjusted to its fair value at acquisition and to conform to our inventory accounting policies reported homebuilding gross profit would have been greater by approximately 611 million 09 of homebuilding revenues 14   the consolidated provision for income taxes increased 588 to 2428 million in 2002 from 1529 million in 2001 due to the corresponding increase in income before income taxes the effective income tax rate of 375 remained the same in both periods results of operations — homebuilding   we currently conduct our homebuilding operations in five market regions consisting of the following markets    the following tables set forth certain operating and financial data for the company’s homebuilding activities

    sales backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period some of which are subject to contingencies including mortgage loan approval in the past our backlog has been a reliable indicator of future closings 

 

   revenues from home sales increased 276 to 83341 million 35934 homes closed in 2003 from 65296 million 29761 homes closed in 2002 revenues from home sales increased in all of our five market regions with percentage increases ranging from 50 in the midwest region to 414 in the west region the increases in both revenues and homes closed were due to strong housing demand throughout the majority of our markets and the acquisition of schuler excluding the fiscal 2003 activities of schuler prior to the february 21 2003 anniversary date of the acquisition home sales revenues increased 203 to 78560 million 34410 homes closed in 2003 from 65296 million 29761 homes closed in 2002 revenues from the sale of land and lots increased 1280 to 2180 million in 2003 from 956 million in 2002   the average selling price of homes we closed during 2003 was 231900 up 57 from 219400 in 2002 the increase in average selling price was due primarily to the increase in homes closed in the west region to 337 of total homes closed in 2003 from 320 of homes closed in 2002 in the west region average selling prices are higher than in any of our other market regions   the value of net new sales orders increased 331 to 91623 million 38725 homes in 2003 from 68859 million 31491 homes in 2002 the value of net new sales orders increased in all of our five market regions with percentage increases ranging from 115 in the midatlantic to 463 in the west the overall increase in the value of net new sales orders was due to strong housing demand throughout the majority of our markets excluding the fiscal 2003 activities of schuler prior to the february 21 2003 anniversary date of the acquisition the value of net new sales orders increased 228 to 84529 million and the number of net new sales orders increased 166 to 36706 homes the average price of a net new sales order in 2003 was 16 236600 up 82 over the 218700 average in 2002 the increase in average selling price was due primarily to the increase in net new sales orders in the west region to 331 of the total net new sales orders in 2003 from 309 of net new sales orders in 2002 in the west region average selling prices are higher than in any of our other market regions 

  at september 30 2003 our backlog of sales orders was 36534 million 15488 homes up 293 from 28252 million 12697 homes at september 30 2002 the average sales price of homes in backlog was 235900 at september 30 2003 up 60 from the 222500 average at september 30 2002 as with the average selling prices of homes closed and sold the increase in the average selling price of homes in backlog was primarily due to the effect of the increase in homes sold in the west region which has the highest average sales price of all of our market regions   cost of sales increased by 269 to 68058 million in 2003 from 53644 million in 2002 the increase in cost of sales was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues cost of home sales as a percentage of home sales revenues decreased 15 percentage points to 794 in 2003 from 809 in 2002 most of the costs associated with the sales of inventory acquired in the schuler acquisition with lower gross margins as a result of purchase accounting adjustments that increased the acquired inventory to its fair value as of the date of acquisition was recognized in 2002   selling general and administrative sga expenses from homebuilding activities increased by 263 to 8171 million in 2003 from 6468 million in 2002 as a percentage of revenues sga expenses decreased to 96 in 2003 from 98 in 2002 the 02 percentage point decline in sga expenses as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to the increased leverage of fixed sga expenses achieved by the increase in homebuilding revenues   interest expense associated with homebuilding activities decreased to 52 million in 2003 from 60 million in 2002 due to the declining interest rate environment experienced in 2003 our total interest costs as a percentage of average interestbearing debt declined also throughout 2003 inventory under construction or development grew at a more rapid pace than interestbearing debt therefore a larger proportion of total interest incurred was capitalized to inventory than in 2002 we follow a policy of capitalizing interest only on inventory under construction or development during both years we expensed the portion of incurred interest and other financing costs which could not be charged to inventory capitalized interest and other financing costs are included in cost of sales at the time homes are closed   other expense associated with homebuilding activities was 94 million in 2003 compared to 169 million in 2002 the expense in 2003 is primarily due to a 42 million writedown to estimated fair value of the carrying amounts of our investments in startup and emerging growth companies and 118 million of minority interests in the income of our consolidated joint ventures the expense was offset in part by 36 million in interest income and a 18 million increase in the fair value of our interest rate swaps the expense in 2002 was primarily due to a 123 million decline in the fair value of our interest rate swaps and a 66 million writedown to estimated fair value of the carrying amounts of our investments in startup and emerging growth companies 

 

   revenues from home sales increased 522 to 65296 million 29761 homes closed in 2002 from 42898 million 21371 homes closed in 2001 revenues from home sales increased in all of our five market regions with percentage increases ranging from 30 in the midatlantic region to 1258 in the west region the increases in both revenues and homes closed were due to strong housing demand throughout the majority of our markets an increase in the average selling price of homes closed and the increases attributable to the acquisition of fortressflorida in may 2001 emerald builders in july 2001 and schuler homes inc in february 2002 in markets where we operated throughout both twelvemonth periods home sales revenues increased by 174 to 50224 million 24478 homes closed in 2002 from 42793 million 21328 homes closed in 2001 17   the average selling price of homes closed during 2002 was 219400 up 93 from 200700 in 2001 the increase in average selling price was primarily due to the higher average selling price 334400 of the 3662 homes closed by the former schuler divisions which operate in the western part of the united states with higher prevailing home prices excluding schuler closings the average selling price of homes we closed was 203300 up 13 from 2001   the value of net new sales orders increased 529 to 68859 million 31491 homes in 2002 from 45026 million 22179 homes in 2001 the value of net new sales orders increased in four of our five market regions with percentage increases ranging from 162 in the southeast to 1179 in the west the value of net new sales orders declined 35 in the midwest although our two primary markets in the midwest chicago and minneapolis st paul remained strong we ceased operations in cincinnati louisville and st louis in 2002 which contributed to the slight decline in net new sales orders in that region the overall increase in the value of net new sales orders was due to strong housing demand throughout the majority of our markets as well as sales achieved by fortressflorida emerald builders and schuler homes in markets where we operated throughout both fiscal years the value of net new sales orders increased 189 to 53435 million and the number of net new sales orders increased 163 to 25762 homes the average price of a net new sales order in 2002 was 218700 up 77 over the 203000 average in 2001 the increase in average selling price was primarily due to the higher average selling price 327100 of the 3666 net new sales orders by the former schuler divisions which operate in the western part of the united states with higher prevailing home prices excluding the schuler net new sales orders our average selling price of net new sales orders in 2002 was 204400 up 07 from 2001   at september 30 2002 our backlog of sales orders was 28252 million 12697 homes up 461 from 19338 million 9263 homes at september 30 2001 in markets where we operated at the end of both fiscal years our backlog of sales orders increased 207 to 23337 million 11070 homes the average sales price of homes in backlog was 222500 at september 30 2002 up 66 from the 208800 average at september 30 2001 as with the average selling prices of homes closed and sold the increase in the average selling price of homes in backlog was primarily due to the effect of homes in the backlogs of the former schuler divisions which operate in the western part of the united states with higher prevailing home prices excluding the schuler amounts the average price of homes in backlog was 210800 up 10 from 2001   cost of sales increased by 521 to 53644 million in 2002 from 35271 million in 2001 the increase in cost of sales was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues cost of home sales as a percentage of home sales revenues increased 05 percentage points to 809 in 2002 from 804 in 2001 the benefits we achieved in 2002 from our continuing ability to raise prices in selected markets and reduce costs through our national purchasing program were offset by sales of inventory acquired in the schuler acquisition that had lower gross margins as a result of purchase accounting adjustments that increased the acquired inventory to its fair value as of the date of the acquisition if the acquired inventory had been recorded at schuler’s historical cost rather than adjusted to its fair value at acquisition and to conform to our inventory accounting policies reported gross profit from home sales would have been greater by approximately 540 million 08 of home sales revenues all of the significant purchase accounting adjustments associated with the schuler acquisition were recorded in 2002 for essentially the same reasons total homebuilding cost of sales was 810 of total homebuilding revenue up 06 percentage points from 804 in 2001   selling general and administrative sga expenses from homebuilding activities increased by 497 to 6468 million in 2002 from 4320 million in 2001 as a percentage of revenues sga expenses decreased to 98 in 2002 from 99 in 2001 the 01 percentage point decline in sga expenses as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to the increased leverage of fixed sga expenses achieved by the increases in homebuilding revenues   interest expense associated with homebuilding activities decreased to 60 million in 2002 from 88 million in 2001 as a percentage of homebuilding revenues homebuilding interest expense decreased to 01 in 2002 from 02 in 2001 due to the declining interest rate environment experienced in 2002 our total interest costs as a percentage of average interestbearing debt declined also throughout 2002 inventory under construction or development grew at a more rapid pace than interestbearing debt therefore a larger 18 proportion of total interest incurred was capitalized to inventory than in 2001 we follow a policy of capitalizing interest only on inventory under construction or development during both years we expensed the portion of incurred interest and other financing costs which could not be charged to inventory capitalized interest and other financing costs are included in cost of sales at the time homes are closed 

  other expense associated with homebuilding activities was 169 million in 2002 as compared to 347 million in 2001 the expense in 2002 is primarily due to a 123 million decline in the fair value of our interest rate swaps and a 66 million writedown to estimated fair value of the carrying amounts of our investments in startup and emerging growth companies the expense in 2001 was primarily due to a 138 million decline in the fair value of our interest rate swaps and a 229 million writedown of the carrying amounts of our investments in startup and emerging growth companies results of operations — financial services   financial services include mortgage financing and title insurance agency and closing services primarily related to purchases of homes we build and sell mortgage services are provided in arizona california colorado florida georgia hawaii illinois maryland minnesota nevada new mexico north carolina oregon south carolina texas virginia and washington title agency and closing services are provided in arizona florida georgia maryland minnesota new jersey texas and virginia the following table summarizes financial and other information for the company’s financial services operations  

 

   revenues from the financial services segment increased 549 to 1760 million in 2003 from 1136 million in 2002 the increase in financial services revenues was primarily due to the increase in homes closed and the continued expansion of our mortgage loan and title services provided to customers of our homebuilding segment general and administrative expenses associated with financial services increased 450 to 983 million in 2003 from 678 million in 2002 as a percentage of financial services revenues general and administrative expenses decreased by 38 percentage points to 559 in 2003 from 597 in 2002 due primarily to efficiencies realized with the increase in revenues generated from the increase in homes closed 

 

   revenues from the financial services segment increased 578 to 1136 million in 2002 from 720 million in 2001 the increase in financial services revenues was due to the rapid expansion of our 19 mortgage loan and title services provided to customers of our homebuilding segment and the effects of the fortressflorida and emerald builders acquisitions general and administrative expenses associated with financial services increased 430 to 678 million in 2002 from 474 million in 2001 as a percentage of financial services revenues general and administrative expenses decreased by 62 percentage points to 597 in 2002 from 659 in 2001 due primarily to efficiencies realized with the increase in revenues generated in markets we entered in 2001

  on june 18 2003 we issued 100 million of 5 78 senior notes due 2013 the net proceeds from this offering were used to redeem the 100 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 9 senior notes due 2008 which we called for full redemption on june 25 2003 and redeemed on july 25 2003 at a redemption price of 1045 of the principal amount together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date the aggregate redemption price including accrued interest amounted to 1070 million concurrent with the redemption we recorded interest expense of approximately 25 million representing the difference between the redemption premium and the unamortized premium associated with the redeemed notes the 5 78 senior notes due 2013 are guaranteed by substantially all of our whollyowned subsidiaries other than our financial services subsidiaries   during fiscal 2003 we repurchased 2652800 shares of our common stock in open market transactions at an aggregate purchase price of 589 million on july 31 2003 our board of directors increased the authorizations for repurchases of our common stock and of our outstanding debt securities to 200 million each at september 30 2003 1756 million remained of the stock repurchase authorization and 200 million remained of the debt securities repurchase authorization   we examine the carrying value of our excess cost over net assets acquired goodwill annually to determine whether there are any impairment losses impairment is determined to exist when the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value our consolidated goodwill amounted to 5789 million homebuilding and 12 million financial services at september 30 2003 we performed the required tests during the last two fiscal years and determined that no goodwill or other intangible asset impairments existed   at september 30 2003 our financial services segment had mortgage loans held for sale of 4855 million and loan commitments for 4587 million at fixed rates we hedge the interest rate risk on these mortgage loans and mortgage loan commitments through the use of bestefforts whole loan delivery commitments forward sales of mortgagebacked securities and the infrequent purchase of options on financial instruments changes in the value of the derivative instruments are recognized in current earnings as are the changes in the value of the funded loans such gains and losses have not significantly affected our financial services results of operations   currently our whollyowned mortgage company has a mortgage warehouse loan facility in the amount of 230 million which matures on february 12 2004 and which is secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale the mortgage warehouse facility is not guaranteed by either the parent company or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt and is expected to be renewed prior to maturity in the ordinary course of business at september 30 2003 1480 million had been drawn under the mortgage warehouse facility our whollyowned mortgage company completed a 100 million mortgagebacked commercial paper conduit facility the “cp conduit facility” in july 2002 the cp conduit facility was increased to 300 million on july 25 2003 although the current agreement governing the cp conduit facility expires on june 29 2006 maintenance of the facility beyond the first and subsequent anniversary dates must be annually approved by the sponsoring bank the cp conduit facility is also secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale and is not guaranteed by either the parent company or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt as of september 30 2003 2500 million had been drawn under the cp conduit facility the mortgage loans pledged to secure the cp conduit facility are used as collateral for mortgagebacked securities sold in the secondary commercial paper markets at rates that are more attractive than those applicable to the mortgage warehouse facility all mortgage company activities are financed with the mortgage warehouse facility the cp conduit facility or internally generated funds both of the financial services’ credit facilities contain financial covenants with which we are in compliance   our historical strategy of internal growth and growth by acquisitions has required significant amounts of cash if we are to achieve our future growth targets we expect that those cash requirements will continue we anticipate that future home construction lot and land purchases and any acquisitions will be funded through internally generated funds existing and future credit facilities and the issuance of new debt or equity securities at september 30 2003 under currently effective shelf registration statements we had approxi 21 mately 15 million shares of common stock issuable to effect in whole or in part possible future acquisitions and the capacity to issue new debt or equity securities amounting to 485 million 

  in the future we intend to continue to maintain effective shelf registration statements that will facilitate access to the capital markets we believe that our current cash position our cash generation capabilities the amounts available under our revolving line of credit agreements and our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner with our existing shelf registration statements are adequate to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable future   during fiscal 2003 our board of directors declared one quarterly cash dividend of 006 per common share and three quarterly cash dividends of 007 per common share the last of which was paid on august 22 2003 to stockholders of record on august 8 2003 on october 9 2003 our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 007 per common share which was paid on october 31 2003 to stockholders of record on october 20 2003   on december 1 2003 our board of directors declared a threefortwo common stock split to be effected as a 50 stock dividend which will be payable on january 12 2004 to holders of record on december 22 2003 cash will be paid in lieu of fractional shares   except for ordinary expenditures for the construction of homes the acquisition of land and lots for development and sale of homes at september 30 2003 we had no material commitments for capital expenditures offbalance sheet arrangements   in the ordinary course of business we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts in order to procure land or lots for the construction of homes lot option contracts enable us to control significant lot positions with a minimal capital investment and substantially reduces the risks associated with land ownership and development at september 30 2003 we had 1286 million in deposits to purchase land and lots with a total purchase price of 24 billion only 520 million of the 24 billion in land and lot option purchase contracts contain specific performance clauses which require us to purchase the land or lots pursuant to fin 46 we consolidated certain variable interest entities with assets of 1050 million   at september 30 2003 we had outstanding letters of credit of 1186 million and performance bonds of 11471 million issued by third parties to secure performance under various contracts we expect that the obligations secured by these letters of credit and performance bonds will generally be performed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms to the extent that the obligations are performed the related letters of credit and performance bonds will be released and we will not have any continuing obligations we have no material thirdparty guarantees inflation   we and the homebuilding industry in general may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation primarily because of higher land and construction costs inflation also increases our financing labor and material costs in addition higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers we attempt to pass through to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices and to date inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations however there is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations safe harbor statement   certain statements contained in this report as well as in other materials we have filed or will file with the securities and exchange commission statements made by us in periodic press releases and oral statements we make to analysts stockholders and the press in the course of presentations about us may be construed as “forwardlooking statements” as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 these forwardlooking statements typically include the words “anticipate” “believe” “expect” “estimate” “pro 22 ject” and “future” any or all of the forwardlooking statements included in this report and in any other of our reports or public statements may turn out to be inaccurate due to known or unknown risks and uncertainties as a result actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in and anticipated by the forwardlooking statements the following cautionary discussion of risks and uncertainties relevant to our business includes factors we believe could adversely affect us other factors beyond those listed below could also adversely affect us

operating strategy 

  

we believe that the following operating strategies have enabled us to achieve consistent growth and profitability 

  

geographic diversity 

  

from 1978 to late 1987 excluding locations acquired in our 1998 merger with continental homes our homebuilding activities were conducted in the dallasfort worth area we then instituted a policy of diversifying geographically entering the following of our current markets both through startup operations and acquisitions in the years shown 

  

 

  

we continually monitor the sales and margins achieved in each of the subdivisions in which we operate as part of our evaluation of the use of our capital while we believe there are significant growth opportunities in our existing markets we also intend to continue our policy of diversification by seeking to enter new markets we believe our diversification strategy mitigates the effects of local and regional economic cycles and enhances our growth potential typically we will not invest material amounts in real estate including raw land developed lots models and speculative homes or overhead in startup operations in new markets until such markets demonstrate significant growth potential and acceptance of our products 

  

acquisitions 

  

we are currently focusing on internal growth however as an integral component of our operational strategy of continued expansion we are continuing our historical approach of evaluating opportunities for strategic acquisitions in the future we believe that expanding our operations through the acquisition of existing homebuilding companies has afforded us several benefits not found in startup operations such benefits include 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

in evaluating potential acquisition candidates we have sought homebuilding companies that have an excellent reputation a track record of profitability and a strong management team with an entrepreneurial orientation we have limited the risks associated with acquiring a going concern by conducting extensive operational financial and legal due diligence on each acquisition and by only acquiring homebuilding companies that we believe will have an immediate positive impact on our earnings in the last nine fiscal years we have made 17 acquisitions in the future we may resume acquisitions of homebuilders that satisfy our acquisition criteria in existing or new markets 

  

decentralized operations 

  

we decentralize our homebuilding activities to give more operating flexibility to our local division presidents we have 48 separate operating divisions some of which are in the same market area generally each operating division consists of a division president an office manager and staff a sales manager and sales personnel and a construction manager and construction superintendents we believe that division presidents who are intimately familiar with local conditions make better decisions regarding local operations our division presidents receive performance bonuses based upon achieving targeted operating levels in their operating divisions 

  

operating division responsibilities 

  

each operating division is responsible for

the corporate office controls key risk elements through centralized 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

cost management 

  

we control our overhead costs by centralized administrative and accounting functions and by limiting the number of field administrative personnel and middle level management positions we also minimize advertising costs by participating in promotional activities publications and newsletters sponsored by local real estate brokers mortgage companies utility companies and trade associations 

  

we control construction costs through the efficient design of our homes and by obtaining favorable pricing from certain subcontractors and national vendors based on the high volume of services and products they provide us we also control construction costs by monitoring expenses on each house through our purchase order system we control capital and overhead costs by monitoring our inventory levels through our management information systems

our homebuilding revenues by geographic region are 

  

 

  

land policies 

  

typically we acquire land only after necessary “entitlements” have been obtained ie when we have the right to begin development or construction before we acquire lots or tracts of land we will among other things 

complete a feasibility study which includes soil tests independent environmental studies and other engineering work and determine that all necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements required to develop and use the property for home construction have been acquired although we purchase and develop land primarily to support our own homebuilding activities occasionally we sell lots and land to other developers and homebuilders 

  

we also use lot option contracts in which we purchase the right but not the obligation to buy building lots at predetermined prices on a takedown schedule commensurate with anticipated home closings lot option contracts generally are on a nonrecourse basis thereby limiting our financial exposure to earnest money deposits given to property sellers this enables us to control significant lot positions with a minimal capital investment and substantially reduces the risks associated with land ownership and development at september 30 2002 about 47 of our total lot position of 150763 lots was under option contracts 

  

a summary of our landlot position at september 30 2002 is 

  

 

  

we limit our exposure to real estate inventory risks by 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

construction 

  

our home designs are prepared by architects in each of our markets to appeal to local tastes and preferences of the community we also offer optional interior and exterior features to enhance the basic home design and to promote our sales efforts 

  

substantially all of our construction work is performed by subcontractors our construction supervisors monitor the construction of each home participate in important design and building decisions coordinate the activities of subcontractors and suppliers subject the work of subcontractors to quality and cost controls and monitor compliance with zoning and building codes subcontractors typically are retained for a specific subdivision pursuant to a contract that obligates the subcontractor to complete construction at a fixed price agreements with our subcontractors and suppliers generally are negotiated for each subdivision we compete with other homebuilders for qualified subcontractors raw materials and lots in the markets where we operate 

  

construction time for our homes depends on the weather availability of labor materials and supplies size of the home and other factors we typically complete the construction of a home within four months 

  

we do not maintain significant inventories of construction materials except for work in process materials for homes under construction typically the construction materials used in our operations are readily available from numerous sources we have contracts exceeding one year with certain suppliers of our building materials that are cancellable at our option with a 30 day notice in recent years we have not experienced any significant delays in construction due to shortages of materials or labor 

  

marketing and sales 

  

we market and sell our homes through commissioned employees and independent real estate brokers we typically conduct home sales from sales offices located in furnished model homes in each subdivision at september 30 2002 we owned 1207 model homes which we generally do not offer for sale until the completion of a subdivision our sales personnel assist prospective home buyers by providing them with floor plans price information tours of model homes and the selection of options and other custom features we train and inform our sales personnel as to the availability of financing construction schedules and marketing and advertising plans 

  

in addition to using model homes we typically build a limited number of speculative homes in each subdivision to enhance our marketing and sales activities construction of these speculative homes also is necessary to satisfy the requirements of relocated personnel and independent brokers who often represent home buyers requiring a completed home within 60 days we sell a majority of these speculative homes while they are under construction or immediately following completion the number of speculative homes is influenced by local market factors such as new employment opportunities significant job relocations growing housing demand and the length of time we have built in the market depending upon the seasonality of each market we attempt to limit our speculative homes in each subdivision at september 30 2002 we averaged less than five speculative homes in various stages of construction in each subdivision 

  

we advertise on a limited basis in newspapers and in real estate broker mortgage company and utility publications brochures newsletters and on billboards in addition we use our internet website to market the location price range and availability of our homes to minimize advertising costs we attempt to operate in subdivisions in conspicuous locations that permit us to take advantage of local traffic patterns we also believe that model homes play a significant role in our marketing efforts consequently we expend significant effort in creating an attractive atmosphere in our model homes 

  

our sales contracts require a down payment of at least 500 the contracts include a financing contingency which permits customers to cancel if they cannot obtain mortgage financing at prevailing interest rates within a specified period typically four to six weeks and may include other contingencies such as the sale of an existing home we include a home sale in our sales backlog when the sales contract is signed and we have received the initial down payment we do not recognize revenue upon the sale of a home until it is closed and title passes to the home buyer the average period between the signing of a sales contract for a home and closing is approximately three to five months 

  

customer service and quality control 

  

our operating divisions are responsible for preclosing quality control inspections and responding to customers’ postclosing needs we believe that prompt and courteous response to home buyers’ needs during and after construction reduces postclosing repair costs enhances our reputation for quality and service and ultimately leads to significant repeat and referral business from the real estate community and home buyers we provide our home buyers with a limited oneyear warranty on workmanship and building materials the subcontractors who perform most of the actual construction also provide us with warranties on workmanship and are generally prepared to respond to us and the homeowner promptly upon request in addition we provide a supplemental tenyear limited warranty that covers major construction defects to cover our potential warranty obligations we accrue an estimated amount for future warranty costs 

  

customer financing 

  

we provide mortgage financing services principally to purchasers of homes we build and sell ch mortgage a whollyowned subsidiary provides mortgage banking services in arizona california colorado florida georgia illinois maryland minnesota nevada new mexico north and south carolina oregon texas virginia and washington drh mortgage llc a joint venture formed in 1998 with a third party has until recently provided mortgage origination services in california during the year ended september 30 2002 in the markets served our combined mortgage banking entities provided mortgage financing services for approximately 72 of the homes closed that required mortgage financing an increase from 64 during the year ended september 30 2001 we anticipate expanding these mortgage activities to other markets in which we conduct homebuilding operations 

  

in other markets where we currently do not provide mortgage financing we work with a variety of mortgage lenders that make available to home buyers a range of conventional mortgage financing programs by making information about these programs available to prospective home buyers and maintaining a relationship with such mortgage lenders we are able to coordinate and expedite the entire sales transaction by ensuring that mortgage commitments are received and that closings take place on a timely and efficient basis 

  

title services 

  

through our subsidiaries century title custom title drh title company of texas ltd drh title company of florida inc drh title company of minnesota inc metro title company principal title and travis county title company we serve as a title insurance agent by providing title insurance policies examination and closing services to purchasers of homes we build in the austin dallas fort worth houston marylanddc miamiwest palm beach minneapolis orlando phoenix san antonio and virginiadc markets we assume no underwriting risk associated with these title policies 

  

employees 

  

at september 30 2002 we employed 5701 persons of whom 1317 were sales and marketing personnel 1975 were executive administrative and clerical personnel 1654 were involved in construction and 755 worked in mortgage and title operations the company had fewer than 20 employees covered by collective bargaining agreements employees of some of the subcontractors which we use are represented by labor unions or are subject to collective bargaining agreements we believe that our relations with our employees and subcontractors are good 

  

competition 

  

the single family residential housing industry is highly competitive and we compete in each of our markets with numerous other national regional and local homebuilders often with larger subdivisions designed planned and developed by such homebuilders our homes compete on the basis of quality price design mortgage financing terms and location 

  

governmental regulation and environmental matters 

  

the housing mortgage and title insurance industries are subject to extensive and complex regulations we and our subcontractors must comply with various federal state and local laws and regulations including zoning density and development requirements building environmental advertising and consumer credit rules and regulations as well as other rules and regulations in connection with our development homebuilding sales and financial services activities these include requirements affecting the development process as well as building materials to be used building designs and minimum elevation of properties our homes are inspected by local 

authorities where required and homes eligible for insurance or guarantees provided by the fha and va are subject to inspection by them these regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities this can delay or increase the cost of development or homebuilding 

  

we also are subject to a variety of local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning protection of health and the environment the particular environmental laws for each site vary greatly according to location environmental condition and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties these environmental laws may result in delays may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas 

  

our internal mortgage activities and title insurance agencies must also comply with various federal and state laws consumer credit rules and regulations and other rules and regulations unique to such activities additionally mortgage loans and title activities originated under the fha va fnma and gnma are subject to rules and regulations imposed by those agencies

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

general — a comprehensive enumeration of the significant accounting policies of dr horton inc and subsidiaries is presented in note a to the accompanying financial statements as of september 30 2002 and 2001 and for the years ended september 30 2002 2001 and 2000 each of our accounting policies has been chosen based upon current authoritative literature that collectively comprises generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” for public companies operating in the united states of america in instances where alternative methods of accounting for a given economic phenomenon are permissible under gaap we have chosen the method that most appropriately reflects the nature of our business the results of our operations and our financial condition and have consistently applied those methods over each of the periods presented in the financial statements the audit committee of our board of directors has reviewed and approved the accounting policies selected 

  

basis of presentation — our financial statements include the accounts of dr horton inc and all of its majorityowned or controlled subsidiaries all significant intercompany accounts transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation except for insignificant amounts remaining from our venture capital investments of fiscal 1999 and 2000 and a few inconsequential joint ventures we inherited with the schuler acquisition we owned no minority interests in unconsolidated entities at september 30 2002 based upon currently available information we believe that none of them will qualify for consolidation in our financial statements under the financial accounting standards board’s “fasb” proposed new accounting rules on consolidations 

  

segment information— our reportable business segments consist of homebuilding and financial services our homebuilding segment derives the majority of its revenue from constructing and selling singlefamily housing in 20 states and 44 markets throughout the united states the financial services segment generates revenue by originating and selling mortgage loans and by collecting fees for title insurance and closing services in many of the same markets we have no foreign subsidiaries or operations 

  

revenue recognition — we recognize homebuilding revenues when homes close and title to and possession of the property is formally transferred to the buyer virtually all of our homebuilding revenues are received in cash within a day or two of closing we include amounts in transit from title companies at the end of each reporting period in homebuilding cash when we execute a sales contract with our home buyers or when we require advance payment from home buyers for custom changes upgrades or options related to their homes we record the cash deposits as liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are canceled we either retain or refund to the home buyer deposits on canceled sales contracts depending upon the provisions of the contracts 

  

we recognize financial services revenues associated with our title operations as homes are closed closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued all of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed we recognize the majority of the revenues associated with our mortgage loan operations when the mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to thirdparty investors we earn mortgage loan origination fees when we close and fund the loans associated with the homes financed we defer the earned origination fees net of direct origination costs and recognize them as revenues along with the associated gains or losses on the sales of the loans and related servicing rights when the loans are sold to thirdparty investors all of the financial services mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to thirdparty investors all of the underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies is transferred to thirdparty insurers 

  

inventories — we use the specific identification method for the purpose of accumulating costs associated with home construction we state inventories at the lower of historical cost or fair value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 121 in addition to the costs of direct land 

acquisition land development and home construction inventory costs include interest real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and home construction applicable direct overhead costs that we incur after development projects or homes are substantially complete are charged to selling general and administrative sga expense as incurred all indirect overhead costs such as construction superintendents’ compensation advertising and builder’s risk insurance are either charged to sga expense as incurred or in the case of builder’s risk insurance amortized to sga expense over the applicable policy periods 

  

we amortize to cost of sales for homes closed all applicable land acquisition land development and related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each project any changes to the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial home closings in a project are generally allocated on a prorata basis to the remaining homes in the project 

  

when a home is closed we usually have not yet recorded and paid all incurred costs necessary to complete the home each month we record as a liability and as a charge to cost of sales the amount we will ultimately pay related to completed homes that have been closed as of the end of that month we compare our home construction budgets to actual recorded costs to estimate the additional costs needed to complete each closed home we monitor the accuracy of each month’s accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on closed homes in subsequent months to the amount we accrued although actual costs to complete in the future could differ from our current estimate our method has historically produced consistently accurate estimates of actual costs to complete closed homes 

  

each quarter we review all components of our inventory for the purpose of determining whether recorded costs and costs required to complete each home or project are recoverable if our review indicates that an impairment loss is required under the sfas no 121 guidelines we estimate and record such loss to cost of sales in that quarter to date such impairment losses have occurred primarily in markets that we have chosen to abandon and have been insignificant in the aggregate fair value estimation under sfas no 121 involves management estimates of future revenues and costs and due to uncertainties in the estimation process it is at least reasonably possible that actual results could differ from such estimates 

  

warranty costs — warranty reserves have been established by charging cost of sales and crediting a warranty liability for each home closed the amounts charged are estimated by management to be adequate to cover expected warrantyrelated costs for materials and labor required under one and tenyear warranty obligation periods the oneyear warranty is comprehensive for all parts and labor the tenyear period is for major construction defects we have and require all of our subcontractors to have general liability insurance that protects us against a portion of our risk of loss from construction product defects but accrue the warranty costs liability to cover our selfinsured retentions and deductible amounts under those policies our warranty cost accruals are based upon our historical warranty cost experience in each market in which we operate and are adjusted as appropriate to reflect qualitative risks associated with the type of homes we build and the geographic areas in which we build them actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts 

  

interest rate swaps — we have two interest rate swap agreements with a major united states bank under which we receive each quarter the london interbank offered rate libor and pay a fixed amount that averages 51 on a total notional amount of 200 million we entered into both of the tenyear swap contracts in 1998 because we were unwilling to “buy out” the bank’s current right to cancel each swap during any quarter in which libor exceeds 7 we chose not to designate the swaps as cashflow hedges under sfas no 133 which we adopted on october 1 2000 as a result even though they still protect us to some extent from increases in variable interest rates associated with our revolving credit facility we are required to record the changes in their market value in our income statement each quarter at the end of each quarter the swaps’ market value will have changed depending upon the market’s current anticipation of quarterly libor rate levels from the present until the swaps’ maturity in 2008 the swaps’ market values generally vary directly with changes in anticipated future libor rates the declines in short term interest rates in the past two years have resulted in a decline in the swaps’ market value to a liability of approximately 226 million at september 30 2002 we cannot predict the 

changes in either future libor rates or the market values of our swaps any future reductions in anticipated libor rates could result in corresponding future reductions in their market value and charges to our income statements 

  

goodwill — we adopted sfas no 142 at the beginning of fiscal 2002 under its provisions we are no longer permitted to amortize goodwill to earnings such amounts are recorded on our balance sheet under the caption “excess of cost over net assets acquired” and in our homebuilding segment totaled 5792 million at september 30 2002 sfas no 142 requires companies to periodically assess recorded goodwill amounts for the purpose of determining whether any impairments have occurred and need to be recorded we performed such assessments as of october 1 2001 and september 30 2002 and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed the goodwill assessment procedures required by sfas no 142 require management to make comprehensive estimates of future revenues and costs and due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates it is at least reasonably possible that actual results could differ from such estimates 

  

stockbased compensation— with the approval of the board of directors we occasionally issue to employees options to purchase our common stock our board of directors approves grants only out of amounts remaining available for grant from amounts formally authorized by our common stockholders we grant approved options with strike prices equal to the market price of the common stock on the date of the option grant the majority of the options granted vest ratably over a tenyear period we account for options under the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and accordingly recognize no compensation expense for the grants at the time of issuance sfas no 123 requires us to disclose the effects on net income and diluted net income per share had we recorded compensation expense for the estimated value of the options when granted and the changes in their values over their terms the sfas no 123 requirements applied only to options granted after its effective date if we had used the blackscholes formula for valuing option grants made after our adoption of sfas no 123 our net income would have been 19 million 23 million and 27 million less than reported amounts for fiscal 2000 2001 and 2002 respectively and diluted net income per share would have been 002 less than the reported amounts for each of those years for the present we have chosen to continue our current method of accounting for stock options until the fasb andor the securities and exchange commission sec have formalized and revised requirements for accounting for them in the future when they do we will promptly adopt whatever new accounting methods are required 

  

results of operations—consolidated 

  

we provide homebuilding services in 20 states and 44 markets through our 48 homebuilding divisions through our financial services operations we also provide mortgage banking and title agency services in many of these same markets 

  

year ended september 30 2002 compared to year ended september 30 2001 

  

consolidated revenues increased 512 to 67388 million in 2002 from 44555 million in 2001 primarily due to increases in both home sales and financial services revenues the increase in home sales revenues was attributable in part to 15072 million in revenues generated by fortressflorida acquired in may 2001 emerald builders acquired in july 2001 and schuler homes inc acquired in february 2002 during the periods in 2002 that were less than one year after each was acquired 

  

income before income taxes increased 588 to 6475 million in 2002 from 4078 million in 2001 as a percentage of revenues income before income taxes increased 04 percentage points to 96 from 92 in 2001 factors contributing to that improvement were reductions in homebuilding other expense a 01 percentage point improvement in homebuilding sga expenses as a percentage of revenues a significantly improved operating margin in our financial services segment all offset in part by a 05 percentage point decline in our homebuilding gross margins the decline in the homebuilding gross margin was due primarily to sales of 

inventory acquired in the schuler acquisition that had lower gross margins as a result of purchase accounting adjustments that increased the acquired inventory to its fair value as of the date of the acquisition if the acquired inventory had been recorded at schuler’s historical cost rather than adjusted to its fair value at acquisition and to conform to our inventory accounting policies reported homebuilding gross profit would have been greater by approximately 611 million 09 of homebuilding revenues 

  

the consolidated provision for income taxes increased 588 to 2428 million in 2002 from 1529 million in 2001 due to the corresponding increase in income before income taxes the effective income tax rate of 375 remained the same in both periods 

  

year ended september 30 2001 compared to year ended september 30 2000 

  

consolidated revenues increased 219 to 44555 million in 2001 from 36537 million in 2000 primarily due to increases in both home sales and financial services revenues the increase in home sales revenues was attributable in part to 1030 million in revenues generated by fortressflorida acquired in may 2001 and emerald builders acquired in july 2001 

  

income before income taxes increased 319 to 4078 million in 2001 from 3092 million in 2000 as a percentage of revenues income before income taxes increased 07 percentage points to 92 from 85 in 2000 primarily due to the increase in gross profit percentage achieved by the homebuilding segment which was offset in part by writedowns to estimated fair value of the carrying amounts of our investments in startup and emerging growth companies and the decline in the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements during the year 

  

the consolidated provision for income taxes increased 301 to 1529 million in 2001 from 1175 million in 2000 due to the corresponding increase in income before income taxes the effective income tax rate decreased 05 percentage points to 375 in 2001 from 380 in 2000 primarily due to changes in the overall effective state income tax rate 

  

results of operations—homebuilding 

  

we currently conduct our homebuilding operations in five market regions consisting of the following markets 

  

 

  

the following tables set forth certain operating and financial data for the company’s homebuilding activities 

  

 

  

homes closed 

  

 

  

new net sales contracts 

  

 

  

sales backlog 

  

 

  

sales backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period some of which are subject to contingencies including mortgage loan approval in the past our backlog has been a reliable indicator of future closings 

  

year ended september 30 2002 compared to year ended september 30 2001 

  

revenues from home sales increased 522 to 65296 million 29761 homes closed in 2002 from 42898 million 21371 homes closed in 2001 revenues from home sales increased in all of our five market regions with percentage increases ranging from 30 in the midatlantic region to 1258 in the west region the increases in both revenues and homes closed were due to strong housing demand throughout the majority of our markets an increase in the average selling price of homes closed and the increases attributable to the acquisition of fortressflorida in may 2001 emerald builders in july 2001 and schuler homes inc in february 2002 in markets where we operated throughout both twelvemonth periods home sales revenues increased by 174 to 50224 million 24478 homes closed in 2002 from 42793 million 21328 homes closed in 2001 

  

the average selling price of homes we closed during 2002 was 219400 up 93 from 200700 in 2001 the increase in average selling price was primarily due to the higher average selling price 334400 of the 3662 homes closed by the former schuler divisions which operate in the western part of the united states with higher prevailing home prices excluding schuler closings the average selling price of homes we closed was 203300 up 13 from 2001 

  

the value of new net sales contracts increased 529 to 68859 million 31491 homes in 2002 from 45026 million 22179 homes in 2001 the value of new net sales contracts increased in four of our five market regions with percentage increases ranging from 162 in the southeast to 1179 in the west the value of new net sales contracts declined 35 in the midwest although our two primary markets in the midwest chicago and minneapolisst paul remain strong we ceased operations in cincinnati louisville and st louis in 2002 which contributed to the slight decline in new net sales contracts in that region the overall increase in the value of new net sales contracts was due to strong housing demand throughout the majority of our markets as well as sales achieved by fortressflorida emerald builders and schuler homes in markets where we operated throughout both fiscal years the value of new net sales contracts increased 189 to 53435 million and the number of new net sales contracts increased 163 to 25762 homes the average price of a new net sales contract in 2002 was 218700 up 77 over the 203000 average in 2001 the increase in average selling price was primarily due to the higher average selling price 327100 of the 3666 homes sold by the former schuler divisions which operate in the western part of the united states with higher prevailing home prices excluding the schuler sales our average selling price of homes sold in 2002 was 204400 up 07 from 2001 

  

at september 30 2002 our backlog of sales contracts was 28252 million 12697 homes up 461 from 19338 million 9263 homes at september 30 2001 in markets where we operated at the end of both fiscal years our backlog of sales contracts increased 207 to 23337 11070 homes the average sales price of homes in backlog was 222500 at september 30 2002 up 66 from the 208800 average at september 30 2001 as with the average selling prices of homes closed and sold the increase in the average selling price of homes in backlog was primarily due to the effect of homes in the backlogs of the former schuler divisions which operate in the western part of the united states with higher prevailing home prices excluding the schuler amounts the average price of homes in our backlog was 210800 up 10 from 2001 

  

cost of sales increased by 521 to 53644 million in 2002 from 35271 million in 2001 the increase in cost of sales was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues cost of home sales as a percentage of home sales revenues increased 05 percentage points to 809 in 2002 from 804 in 2001 the benefits we achieved in 2002 from our continuing ability to raise prices in selected markets and reduce costs through our national purchasing program were offset by sales of inventory acquired in the schuler acquisition that had lower gross margins as a result of purchase accounting adjustments that increased the acquired inventory to its fair value as of the date of the acquisition if the acquired inventory had been recorded at schuler’s historical cost rather than adjusted to its fair value at acquisition and to conform to our inventory accounting policies reported gross profit from home sales would have been greater by approximately 540 million 08 of home sales revenues all of the significant purchase accounting adjustments associated with the schuler acquisition were recorded in 2002 for essentially the same reasons as mentioned total homebuilding cost of sales was 810 of total homebuilding revenue up 06 percentage points from 804 in 2001 we do not expect future cost of sales to be materially affected by charges associated with the schuler merger 

  

selling general and administrative sga expenses from homebuilding activities increased by 497 to 6468 million in 2002 from 4320 million in 2001 as a percentage of revenues sga expenses decreased to 98 in 2002 from 99 in 2001 the 01 percentage point decline in sga expenses as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to the increased leverage of fixed sga expenses achieved by the increases in homebuilding revenues 

  

interest expense associated with homebuilding activities decreased to 60 million in 2002 from 88 million in 2001 as a percentage of homebuilding revenues homebuilding interest expense decreased to 01 in 2002 from 02 in 2001 due to the declining interest rate environment experienced in 2002 our total interest costs as 

a percentage of average interestbearing debt declined also throughout 2002 inventory under construction or development grew at a more rapid pace than interestbearing debt therefore a larger proportion of total interest incurred was capitalized to inventory than in 2001 we follow a policy of capitalizing interest only on inventory under construction or development during both years we expensed the portion of incurred interest and other financing costs which could not be charged to inventory capitalized interest and other financing costs are included in cost of sales at the time homes are closed 

  

other expense associated with homebuilding activities was 169 million in 2002 as compared to 347 million in 2001 the expense in 2002 is primarily due to a 123 million decline in the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements and a 66 million writedown to estimated fair value of the carrying amounts of our investments in startup and emerging growth companies the expense in 2001 was primarily due to a 138 million decline in the fair value of our interest rate swaps and a 229 million writedown of the carrying amounts of our investments in startup and emerging growth companies

revenues from home sales increased 227 to 42898 million 21371 homes closed in 2001 from 34961 million 19144 homes closed in 2000 revenues from home sales increased in four of our five market regions with percentage increases ranging from 08 in the midwest region to 534 in the west region home sales revenues declined 07 in the midatlantic region the increases in both revenues and homes closed were due to strong housing demand throughout the majority of our markets and an increase in the average selling price of homes closed as well as the increases attributable to the acquisition of fortressflorida in may 2001 and emerald builders in july 2001 in markets where we operated throughout both twelvemonth periods home sales revenues increased by 199 to 41887 million 20748 homes closed in 2001 from 34949 million 19138 homes closed in 2000 

  

the average selling price of homes closed during 2001was 200700 up 99 from 182600 in 2000 the increase in average selling price was due to changes in the mix of homes closed and with the strong housing demand our ability to sell more custom features with our homes and to raise prices in some of our markets 

  

the value of new net sales contracts increased 225 to 45026 million 22179 homes in 2001 from 36764 million 19223 homes in 2000 the value of new net sales contracts increased in all of our five market regions with percentage increases ranging from 24 in the midatlantic to 457 in the west the overall increase in the value of new net sales contracts was due to strong housing demand throughout the majority of our markets as well as sales achieved by fortressflorida and emerald builders in markets where we operated throughout both fiscal years the value of new net sales contracts increased 195 to 43910 million and the number of new net sales contracts increased 120 to 21518 homes the average price of a new net sales contract in 2001 was 203000 up 61 over the 191300 average in 2000 the increase in average selling price was due to changes in the mix of homes sold and with the strong housing demand our ability to sell more custom features with our homes and to raise prices in some of our markets 

  

at september 30 2001 our backlog of sales contracts was 19338 million 9263 homes up 258 from 15369 million 7388 homes at september 30 2000 in markets where we operated at the end of both fiscal years our backlog of sales contracts increased 144 to 17581 8229 homes the average sales price of homes in backlog was 208800 at september 30 2001 up 04 from the 208000 average at september 30 2000 

  

cost of sales increased by 199 to 35271 million in 2001 from 29411 million in 2000 the increase in cost of sales was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues cost of home sales as a percentage of home sales revenues declined 10 percentage point to 804 in 2001 from 814 in 2000 as we continued to benefit from increased prices savings achieved in our national purchasing program and lower material costs total homebuilding cost of sales was 804 of total homebuilding revenue down 12 percentage points from 816 in 2000 

  

selling general and administrative sga expenses from homebuilding activities increased by 199 to 4320 million in 2001 from 3604 million in 2000 as a percentage of revenues sga expenses decreased to 99 in 2001 from 100 in 2000 primarily as a result of a 02 percentage point decline in salaries and benefits expense as a percentage of revenues 

  

interest expense associated with homebuilding activities decreased to 88 million in 2001 from 102 million in 2000 as a percentage of homebuilding revenues homebuilding interest expense decreased to 02 in 2001 from 03 in 2000 throughout 2001 inventory under construction or development grew at a more rapid pace than interestbearing debt therefore a larger proportion of total interest incurred was capitalized to inventory than in 2000 we follow a policy of capitalizing interest only on inventory under construction or development during both years we expensed the portion of incurred interest and other financing costs which could not be charged to inventory capitalized interest and other financing costs are included in cost of sales at the time of home closings 

  

other expense associated with homebuilding activities was 347 million in 2001 compared to 21 million of other income in 2000 the expense in 2001 is primarily due to a 229 million writedown to estimated fair value of the carrying amounts of our investments in startup and emerging growth companies and a 138 million decline in the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

  

at september 30 2002 we had available cash and cash equivalents of 1043 million inventories including finished homes construction in progress and developed residential lots and other land at september 30 2002 had increased by 15387 million from september 30 2001 due to a general increase in business activity the acquisition of schuler homes inc and the expansion of operations in our market areas the inventory increase was financed largely by issuing senior notes and by retaining earnings our revolving credit facility had no amounts outstanding at september 30 2002 and 2001 our ratio of homebuilding notes payable net of cash to total capital at september 30 2002 improved 27 percentage points to 513 from 540 at september 30 2001 the stockholders’ equity to total assets ratio increased 35 percentage points to 377 at september 30 2002 from 342 at september 30 2001 

  

we refinanced our existing unsecured revolving credit facility in fiscal 2002 with a new replacement facility the new 805 million facility includes 125 million which may be used for letters of credit the new facility matures in january 2006 and is guaranteed by substantially all of our whollyowned subsidiaries other than those that make up our financial services segment at september 30 2002 we had outstanding homebuilding debt of 24870 million under the debt covenants associated with the revolving credit facility our additional homebuilding borrowing capacity under it is limited to the lesser of the unused portion of the facility 6971 million at september 30 2002 or an amount determined under a borrowing base arrangement under the borrowing base limitation the sum of our senior debt and the amount drawn on our revolving credit facility may not exceed certain percentages of the various categories of our inventory at september 30 2002 the borrowing base arrangement would have limited our additional borrowing capacity from any source to 12421 million at september 30 2002 we were in compliance with all of the covenants limitations and restrictions that form a part of our public debt obligations and our bank revolving credit facility we have entered into multiyear interest rate swap agreements aggregating a notional amount of 200 million that have the effect of fixing the interest rate on a portion of the variable rate revolving credit facility at 51 

  

on february 21 2002 schuler homes inc merged with and into dr horton inc with dr horton the surviving corporation at the time of the merger schuler’s assets amounted to 13933 million mostly inventory the total merger consideration consisted of the issuance of 20079532 shares of dr horton inc common stock valued at 3093 per share the average closing price of dr horton common stock for a period of ten trading days from december 4 2001 to december 17 2001 the payment of 1687 million in cash the assumption of 8022 million of schuler’s debt 2382 million of which was paid at closing the assumption of trade payables and other liabilities amounting to 2276 million and the assumption of 108 million of obligations to the schuler entities’ minority interest holders also dr horton issued options to purchase approximately 527000 shares of dr horton common stock to schuler employees to replace outstanding schuler stock options the fair value of the options issued was 104 million and was recorded as additional capital the fair value of the unvested options issued was 60 million and was recorded as unearned compensation the unearned compensation is being amortized over the remaining vesting period of the stock options the fair value of the options was estimated using the blackscholes option pricing model 

  

the schuler merger was accounted for as a purchase accordingly schuler’s assets and liabilities including identifiable intangibles were initially recorded at their fair values as of the date of the merger the excess of the 

total consideration paid over the net assets’ fair value approximately 4419 million was recorded as an addition to goodwill 

  

on april 11 2002 we issued 250 million of 8½ senior notes due 2012 the net proceeds from this offering were used to repay borrowings under the unsecured revolving credit facility these notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our whollyowned subsidiaries other than those that make up our financial services segment 

  

on february 21 2002 we assumed the outstanding debt of schuler homes inc as part of schuler’s merger with us the debt assumed included 9 senior notes due 2008 9 3  8  senior notes due 2009 and 10½ senior subordinated notes due 2011 all of which we recorded at their respective market values as of february 21 2002 as required by their indentures in the event of a change of control we offered to redeem all of the schuler notes at 101 of their par amount plus accrued interest in connection with that offer we redeemed 202 million in principal amount of the schuler senior and senior subordinated notes 

  

we examine the carrying value of our excess cost over net assets acquired goodwill annually to determine whether there are any impairment losses impairment is determined to exist when the estimated fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value our consolidated goodwill amounted to 5792 million homebuilding and 12 million financial services at september 30 2002 we performed the required tests at october 1 2001 and september 30 2002 and determined that no goodwill or other intangible asset impairments existed 

  

at september 30 2002 the financial services segment had mortgage loans held for sale of 4641 million and loan commitments for 2793 million at fixed rates we hedge the interest rate market risk on these mortgage loans held for sale and loan commitments through the use of bestefforts whole loan delivery commitments forward sales of mortgagebacked securities and the infrequent purchase of options on financial instruments we record gains or losses related to such hedging instruments in other income as their market value changes such gains and losses have not significantly affected our financial services results of operations 

  

as of september 30 2002 the financial services segment had a 300 million oneyear mortgage warehouse bank facility that matures on august 12 2003 and is secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale the mortgage warehouse facility is not guaranteed by either the parent company or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt at september 30 2002 2424 million had been drawn under the mortgage warehouse facility our whollyowned mortgage company completed a new 100 million mortgagebacked commercial paper conduit facility “cp conduit facility” in july 2002 the facility was increased to 150 million in august 2002 although the agreement governing the cp conduit facility expires on july 3 2005 maintenance of the facility beyond the first and subsequent anniversary dates must be annually approved by the sponsoring bank the cp conduit facility is also secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale and is not guaranteed by either the parent company or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt as of september 30 2002 1490 million had been drawn under the new facility the mortgage loans pledged to secure the new facility are used as collateral for mortgagebacked securities sold by the sponsoring bank in the secondary commercial paper markets at rates that are more attractive than those applicable to the mortgage warehouse facility all mortgage company activities are financed under the mortgage warehouse and cp conduit facilities both of the financial services’ credit facilities contain financial covenants with which we are in compliance subsequent to september 30 2002 the mortgage warehouse facility was reduced to 200 million and the cp conduit facility was increased to 200 million 

  

our historical strategy of internal growth and growth by acquisitions has required significant amounts of cash if we are to achieve our future growth targets we expect that those cash requirements will continue we anticipate that future home construction lot and land purchases and any acquisitions will be funded through internally generated funds existing and future credit facilities and the issuance of new debt or equity securities at september 30 2002 under currently effective shelf registration statements we had approximately 15 million shares of common stock issuable to effect in whole or in part possible future acquisitions and the capacity to issue new debt or equity securities amounting to 10 billion on december 3 2002 we used the 10 billion 

shelf registration statement to issue 215 million 75 senior notes due 2007 leaving the unused shelf registration statement amount at 785 million the 2142 million net proceeds of the december senior note offering were used to pay down amounts borrowed under our bank revolving credit facility 

  

on may 11 2003 the holders of our zero coupon convertible senior notes due 2021 will have an opportunity to require us to purchase their notes for cash at their accreted value of 55973 per note on that date if all of the note holders elect to require us to purchase all of their notes we will be required to purchase notes having a total accreted value of 2133 million on that date 

  

in the future we intend to continue to maintain effective shelf registration statements that will facilitate access to the capital markets we believe that our current cash position our cash generation capabilities the amounts available under our revolving line of credit agreements and our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner with our existing shelf registration statement are adequate to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable future 

  

during fiscal 2002 our board of directors declared one quarterly cash dividend of 005 per common share and three quarterly cash dividends of 006 per common share the last of which was paid on august 23 2002 to stockholders of record on august 9 2002 at september 30 2002 we had 631 million remaining on a board of directors’ authorization for repurchases of our common stock on november 21 2002 our board of directors increased the amount authorized for repurchases of our debt from 100 million to 150 million 

  

in 1999 and 2000 we entered into three separate limited partnership agreements with the purpose of investing in startup and emerging growth companies whose technology and business plans had the potential of permitting us to leverage our size expertise and customer base in the homebuilding industry we originally authorized investment of up to 125 million in such companies over a fouryear period in january 2001 the original 125 million authorization was reduced to the 313 million that had been invested in such companies as of that date the investments are concentrated in ecommerce businesses that serve the homebuilding real estate and financial service industries as well as in businesses whose strategic focus allowed for the diversification of our operations as of september 30 2002 the carrying value of our investments in such companies all accounted for under the cost method and reported in homebuilding other assets amounted to 49 million 

  

except for ordinary expenditures for the construction of homes the acquisition of land and lots for development and sale of homes at september 30 2002 we had no material commitments for capital expenditures 

  

inflation 

  

we and the homebuilding industry in general may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation primarily because of higher land and construction costs inflation also increases our financing labor and material costs in addition higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers we attempt to pass through to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices and to date inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations however there is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we are subject to interest rate risk on our long term debt we monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and utilize both fixed and variable rate debt for fixed rate debt changes in interest rates generally affect the value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows conversely for variable rate debt changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument but may affect our future earnings and cash flows we have mitigated our exposure to changes in interest rates on our variable rate bank debt by entering into interest rate swap agreements to obtain a fixed interest rate for a portion of the variable rate borrowings we generally do not have an obligation to prepay fixedrate debt prior to maturity and as a result interest rate risk and changes in fair value would not have a significant impact on our fixedrate debt until such time as we are required to refinance repurchase or repay such debt 

  

our interest rate swaps were not designated as hedges under statement of financial accounting standards no 133 when it was adopted on october 1 2000 we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in the fair values of the swaps and such changes must be reflected in our income statements 

  

our financial services segment is exposed to interest rate risk associated with its mortgage loan origination services most mortgage loans are funded at fixed interest rates before they are committed to thirdparty investors interest rate lock commitments irlc’s are extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and who meet certain defined credit and underwriting criteria typically irlc’s will have a duration of less than six months forward sales of mortgagebacked securities are designated as fair value hedges against the risk of changes to the overall fair value of funded loans accordingly changes in the value of the derivative instruments are recognized in current earnings as are the changes in the value of the funded loans the effectiveness of the fair value hedge is continuously monitored and any ineffectiveness which for the years ended september 30 2001 and 2002 was not significant is recognized in current earnings interest rate risk associated with irlc’s is managed through the use of bestefforts whole loan delivery commitments forward sales of mortgagebacked securities and the infrequent purchase of options on financial instruments both the irlc’s and these instruments are considered nondesignated derivatives and are accounted for at fair market value with gains and losses recorded in current earnings at september 30 2002 forward sales of mortgage backed securities related to uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale and irlc’s totaled approximately 2295 million at september 30 2002 the fair value of the net forward sales and irlc’s was 02 million

 item 1 business   dr horton inc the “company” is a national homebuilder as such we construct and sell singlefamily homes in metropolitan areas of the midatlantic midwest southeast southwest and west regions of the united states we offer high quality homes designed principally for firsttime and moveup home buyers our homes generally range in size from 1000 to 5000 square feet and range in price from 80000 to 900000 for the year ended september 30 2001 we closed 21371 homes with an average sales price approximating 200700   we are one of the largest and most geographically diversified homebuilders in the united states with operating divisions in 20 states and 38 markets as of september 30 2001 the markets we operate in include albuquerque atlanta austin birmingham charleston charlotte chicago columbia dallas denver fort myers naples fort worth greensboro greenville hilton head houston jacksonville killeen las vegas los angeles louisville marylanddc miami west palm beach minneapolis st paul myrtle beach new jersey orlando phoenix portland raleigh durham richmond sacramento salt lake city san antonio san diego tucson virginiadc and williamsburg   we build homes under the following names dr horton arappco cambridge continental dietz crane dobson emerald mareli milburn regency sgs torrey and trimark   our financial reporting segments consist of homebuilding and financial services our homebuilding operations comprise the most substantial part of our business with more than 98 of consolidated revenues in fiscal 1999 2000 and 2001 the homebuilding operations segment generates the majority of its revenues from the sale of completed homes with a lesser amount from the sale of land and lots the financial services segment generates its revenues from originating and selling mortgages and collecting fees for title insurance and closing services financial information including revenue pretax income and identifiable assets of both of our reporting segments are included in the consolidated financial statements   we were incorporated in delaware on july 1 1991 to acquire all of the assets and businesses of 25 predecessor companies which were residential home construction and development companies owned or controlled by donald r horton   our principal executive offices are located at 1901 ascension blvd suite 100 arlington texas 76006 our telephone number is 817 8568200 and our internet website address is wwwdrhortoncom 1 operating strategy   we believe that the following operating strategies have enabled us to achieve consistent growth and profitability 

 

   from 1978 to late 1987 excluding locations acquired in our 1998 merger with continental homes our homebuilding activities were conducted in the dallas fort worth area we then instituted a policy of diversifying geographically entering the following of our current markets both through startup operations and acquisitions in the years shown    we continually monitor the sales and margins achieved in each of the subdivisions in which we operate as part of our evaluation of the use of our capital while we believe there are significant growth opportunities in our existing markets we also intend to continue our policy of diversification by seeking to enter new markets we believe our diversification strategy mitigates the effects of local and regional economic cycles and enhances our growth potential typically we will not invest material amounts in real estate including raw land developed lots models and speculative homes or overhead in startup operations in new markets until such markets demonstrate significant growth potential and acceptance of our products 

 

   as an integral component of our operational strategy of continued expansion we continually evaluate opportunities for strategic acquisitions we believe that expanding our operations through the acquisition of existing homebuilding companies affords us several benefits not found in startup operations such benefits include    in evaluating potential acquisition candidates we seek homebuilding companies that have an excellent reputation a track record of profitability and a strong management team with an entrepreneurial orientation 2 we limit the risks associated with acquiring a going concern by conducting extensive operational financial and legal due diligence on each acquisition and by only acquiring homebuilding companies that we believe will have an immediate positive impact on our earnings during the last eight fiscal years we have made 16 acquisitions including the assets of fortressflorida inc fortress and emerald builders emerald in may and july 2001 respectively for the year ended december 31 2000 fortress which operates in the jacksonville florida market closed 711 homes generating revenues of approximately 99 million for the year ended december 31 2000 emerald with operations primarily in houston texas and phoenix arizona closed 1394 homes generating revenues of approximately 236 million in october 2001 we signed a definitive agreement under which schuler homes nasdaqshlr will merge into dr horton inc through a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately 12 billion including the assumption of debt we will continue to evaluate potential future acquisition opportunities that satisfy our acquisition criteria in both existing and new markets 

 

   we decentralize our homebuilding activities to give more operating flexibility to our local division presidents we have 45 separate operating divisions some of which are in the same market area generally each operating division consists of a division president an office manager and staff a sales manager and sales personnel and a construction manager and construction superintendents we believe that division presidents who are intimately familiar with local conditions make better decisions regarding local operations our division presidents receive performance bonuses based upon achieving targeted operating levels in their operating divisions 

 

   each operating division is responsible for    

 

   the corporate office controls key risk elements through centralized  3  

 

   we control our overhead costs by centralized administrative and accounting functions and by limiting the number of field administrative personnel and middle level management positions we also minimize advertising costs by participating in promotional activities publications and newsletters sponsored by local real estate brokers mortgage companies utility companies and trade associations   we control construction costs through the efficient design of our homes and by obtaining favorable pricing from certain subcontractors and national vendors based on the high volume of services and products they provide us we also control construction costs by monitoring expenses on each house through our purchase order system we control capital and overhead costs by monitoring our inventory levels through our management information systems markets   we conduct homebuilding activities in five geographic regions consisting of    when entering new markets or conducting operations in existing markets among the things we consider are  4   our homebuilding revenues by geographic region are  land policies   typically we acquire land and enter into lot option contracts to acquire developed building lots only after necessary “entitlements” have been obtained ie when we have the right to begin development or construction before we acquire lots or tracts of land we will among other things complete a feasibility study which includes soil tests independent environmental studies and other engineering work and determine that all necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements required to develop and use the property for home construction have been acquired although we purchase and develop land primarily to support our own homebuilding activities occasionally we sell lots and land to other developers and homebuilders   we also use lot option contracts in which we purchase the right but not the obligation to buy building lots at predetermined prices on a takedown schedule commensurate with anticipated home closings lot option contracts generally are on a nonrecourse basis thereby limiting our financial exposure to earnest money deposits given to property sellers this enables us to control significant lot positions with a minimal capital investment and substantially reduces the risks associated with land ownership and development at september 30 2001 about 46 of our total lot position of 115655 lots was under option contracts   a summary of our landlot position at september 30 2001 is    we limit our exposure to real estate inventory risks by  5 construction   our home designs are prepared by architects in each of our markets to appeal to local tastes and preferences of the community we also offer optional interior and exterior features to enhance the basic home design and to promote our sales efforts   substantially all of our construction work is performed by subcontractors our construction supervisors monitor the construction of each home participate in material design and building decisions coordinate the activities of subcontractors and suppliers subject the work of subcontractors to quality and cost controls and monitor compliance with zoning and building codes subcontractors typically are retained for a specific subdivision pursuant to a contract that obligates the subcontractor to complete construction at a fixed price agreements with our subcontractors and suppliers generally are negotiated for each subdivision we compete with other homebuilders for qualified subcontractors raw materials and lots in the markets where we operate   construction time for our homes depends on the weather availability of labor materials and supplies size of the home and other factors we typically complete the construction of a home within four months   we do not maintain significant inventories of construction materials except for work in process materials for homes under construction typically the construction materials used in our operations are readily available from numerous sources we have contracts exceeding one year with certain suppliers of our building materials that are cancellable at our option with a 30 day notice in recent years we have not experienced any significant delays in construction due to shortages of materials or labor marketing and sales   we market and sell our homes through commissioned employees and independent real estate brokers we typically conduct home sales from sales offices located in furnished model homes in each subdivision at september 30 2001 we owned 942 model homes which we generally do not offer for sale until the completion of a subdivision our sales personnel assist prospective home buyers by providing them with floor plans price information tours of model homes and the selection of options and other custom features we train and inform our sales personnel as to the availability of financing construction schedules and marketing and advertising plans   in addition to using model homes we typically build a limited number of speculative homes in each subdivision to enhance our marketing and sales activities construction of these speculative homes also is necessary to satisfy the requirements of relocated personnel and independent brokers who often represent home buyers requiring a completed home within 60 days we sell a majority of these speculative homes while they are under construction or immediately following completion the number of speculative homes is influenced by local market factors such as new employment opportunities significant job relocations growing housing demand and the length of time we have built in the market depending upon the seasonality of each market we attempt to limit our speculative homes in each subdivision at september 30 2001 we averaged less than five speculative homes in various stages of construction in each subdivision   we advertise on a limited basis in newspapers and in real estate broker mortgage company and utility publications brochures newsletters and on billboards in addition we use our internet web site to market the location price range and availability of our homes to minimize advertising costs we attempt to operate in subdivisions in conspicuous locations that permit us to take advantage of local traffic patterns we also believe that model homes play a significant role in our marketing efforts consequently we expend significant effort in creating an attractive atmosphere in our model homes   our sales contracts require a down payment of at least 500 the contracts include a financing contingency which permits customers to cancel if they cannot obtain mortgage financing at prevailing interest rates within a specified period typically four to six weeks and may include other contingencies such as the sale of an existing home we include a home sale in our sales backlog when the sales contract is signed and we have received the initial down payment we do not recognize revenue upon the sale of a home until it is closed and title passes to the home buyer the average period between the signing of a sales contract for a home and closing is approximately three to five months 6 customer service and quality control   our operating divisions are responsible for preclosing quality control inspections and responding to customers’ postclosing needs we believe that prompt and courteous response to home buyers’ needs during and after construction reduces postclosing repair costs enhances our reputation for quality and service and ultimately leads to significant repeat and referral business from the real estate community and home buyers we provide our home buyers with a limited oneyear warranty on workmanship and building materials the subcontractors who perform most of the actual construction also provide us with warranties on workmanship and are generally prepared to respond to us and the homeowner promptly upon request in most cases we supplement our oneyear warranty by purchasing a tenyear limited warranty from a third party to cover our potential warranty obligations we accrue an estimated amount for future warranty costs
