investments 

providing highquality and affordable health care to an aging global population requires vast investments and infrastructure development we invest in seniors housing and health care real estate primarily through acquisitions developments and joint venture partnerships for additional information regarding acquisition and development activity please see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements our portfolio creates opportunities to connect partners across the continuum of care and drive efficiency we seek to diversify our investment portfolio by property type relationship and geographic location in determining whether to invest in a property we focus on the following 1 the experience of the obligor’spartner’s management team 2 the historical and projected financial and operational performance of the property 3 the credit of the obligorpartner 4 the security for any lease or loan 5 the real estate attributes of the building and its location 6 the capital committed to the property by the obligorpartner and 7 the operating fundamentals of the applicable industry 

we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property our asset management process for seniors housing properties generally includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each property review of obligorpartner creditworthiness property inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure real estate taxes letters of credit and other collateral our internal property management division manages and monitors the outpatient medical portfolio with a comprehensive process including review of among other things tenant relations lease expirations the mix of health service providers hospitalhealth system relationships property performance capital improvement needs and market conditions 

investment types   

real property our properties are primarily comprised of land buildings improvements and related rights our triplenet properties are generally leased to operators under longterm operating leases the leases generally have a fixed contractual term of 12 to 15 years and contain one or more five to 15year renewal options certain of our leases also contain purchase options a portion of which could result in the disposition of properties for less than full market value if the options were to be exercised most of our rents are received under triplenet leases requiring the operator to pay rent and all additional charges incurred in the operation of the leased property the tenants are required to repair rebuild and maintain the leased properties substantially all these operating leases are designed with escalating rent structures leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straightline basis over the initial lease period subject to a collectability assessment rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period 

at december 31 2021 approximately 94 of our triplenet properties were subject to master leases a master lease is a lease of multiple properties to one tenant entity under a single lease agreement from time to time we may acquire additional properties that are then leased to the tenant under the master lease the tenant is required to make one monthly payment that represents rent on all the properties that are subject to the master lease typically the master lease tenant can exercise its right to purchase the properties or to renew the master lease only with respect to all leased properties at the same time we believe this bundling feature benefits us because the tenant cannot limit the purchase or renewal to better performing properties and terminate the leasing arrangement with respect to poorer performing properties this spreads our risk among the entire group of properties within the master lease the bundling feature should provide a similar advantage to us if the master lease tenant is in bankruptcy subject to certain restrictions a debtor in bankruptcy has the right to assume or reject its unexpired leases and executory contracts in the context of integrated master leases such as ours our tenants in bankruptcy would be required to assume or reject the master lease as a whole rather than deciding on a property by property basis 

our outpatient medical portfolio is primarily selfmanaged and consists mainly of multitenant properties leased to health care providers our leases typically include increasers and some form of operating expense reimbursement by the tenant as of december 31 2021 65 of our portfolio included leases with full pass through 30 with a partial expense reimbursement modified gross and 5 with no expense reimbursement gross our outpatient medical leases are noncancellable operating leases that have a weightedaverage remaining term of five years at december 31 2021 and are often credit enhanced by security deposits guarantees andor letters of credit 

construction we provide for the construction of properties for tenants primarily as part of longterm operating leases we capitalize certain interest costs associated with funds used for the construction of properties owned by us the amount capitalized is based upon the amount advanced during the construction period using the rate of interest that approximates our companywide cost of financing our interest expense is reduced by the amount capitalized the construction period commences upon funding and terminates upon the earlier of the completion of the applicable property or the end of a specified period during the construction period we advance funds to the tenants in accordance with agreed upon terms and conditions which require among other things periodic site visits by a company representative during the construction period we generally require an additional credit enhancement in the form of payment and performance bonds andor completion guarantees at december 31 2021 we had outstanding construction investments of 651389000 and were committed to provide additional funds of approximately 1208913000 to complete construction for consolidated investment properties we also provide for construction loans which depending on the terms and conditions could be treated as loans real property or investments in unconsolidated entities 

loans our real estate loans are typically structured to provide us with interest income principal amortization and transaction fees real estate loans consist of mortgage loans and other real estate loans which are primarily collateralized by a first second or third mortgage lien a leasehold mortgage on or an assignment of the partnership interest in the related properties corporate guarantees andor personal guarantees nonreal estate loans are generally corporate loans with no real estate backing at december 31 2021 we had outstanding loans net of allowances of 1292308000 with an interest yield of approximately 112 per annum our yield on loans depends upon a number of factors including the stated interest rate average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments the loans outstanding at december 31 2021 are generally subject to one to 15year terms with principal amortization schedules andor balloon payments of the outstanding principal balances at the end of the term 

investments in unconsolidated entities investments in entities that we do not consolidate but for which we can exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are reported under the equity method of accounting at december 31 2021 we had investments in unconsolidated entities of 1039043000 our investments in unconsolidated entities generally represent interests ranging from 10 to 65 in real estate assets under the equity method of accounting our share of the investee’s earnings or losses is included in our consolidated results of operations the initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated entities is based on the amount paid to purchase the entity interest inclusive of transaction costs we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the equity method investment to its carrying value when we determine a decline in the estimated fair value of such an investment below its carrying value is otherthantemporary an impairment is recorded 

in substance real estate additionally we provide loans to third parties for the acquisition development and construction of real estate under these arrangements it is possible that we will participate in the expected residual profits of the project through the sale refinancing or acquisition of the property we evaluate the characteristics of each arrangement including its risks and rewards to determine whether they are more similar to those associated with a loan or an investment in real estate arrangements with characteristics implying real estate joint ventures are treated as in substance real estate investments accounted for using the equity method and are presented as investments in unconsolidated entities we have made loans related to twelve properties with a carrying value of 317647000 as of december 31 2021 which are classified as in substance real estate investments 

principles of consolidation 

the consolidated financial statements are in conformity with us general accepted accounting principles “us gaap” and include the accounts of our whollyowned subsidiaries and joint venture entities that we control through voting rights or other means all material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation 

at inception of joint venture transactions we identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights “variable interest entities” or “vies” and determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of its operations a vie is broadly defined as an entity where either i the equity investors as a group if any do not have a controlling financial interest or ii the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support we consolidate investments in vies when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary accounting standards codification topic 810 consolidations requires enterprises to perform a qualitative approach to determining whether or not a vie will need to be consolidated this evaluation is based on an enterprise’s ability to direct and influence the activities of a vie that most significantly impact that entity’s economic performance 

for investments in joint ventures us gaap may preclude consolidation by the sole general partner in certain circumstances based on the type of rights held by the limited partners we assess the limited partners’ rights and their impact on our consolidation conclusions and we reassess if there is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights of the limited partners the sole general partner increases or decreases its ownership of limited partnership interests or there is an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding limited partnership interests we similarly evaluate the rights of managing members of limited liability companies 

borrowing policies 

we utilize a combination of debt and equity to fund investments generally we intend to issue unsecured fixedrate public debt with longterm maturities to approximate the maturities on our triplenet leases and investment strategy for shortterm purposes we may borrow on our primary unsecured credit facility or issue commercial paper we replace these borrowings with longterm capital such as senior unsecured notes or common stock when terms are deemed favorable we may invest in properties subject to existing mortgage indebtedness in addition we may obtain secured financing for unleveraged properties in which we have invested or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis in certain agreements with our lenders we are subject to restrictions with respect to secured and unsecured indebtedness 

competition 

we compete with other real estate investment trusts real estate partnerships private equity and hedge fund investors banks insurance companies financeinvestment companies governmentsponsored agencies taxable and taxexempt bond funds health care operators developers and other investors in the acquisition development leasing and financing of health care and seniors housing properties we compete for investments based on a number of factors including relationships certainty of execution investment structures and underwriting criteria our ability to successfully compete is impacted by economic and demographic trends availability of acceptable investment opportunities our ability to negotiate beneficial investment terms availability and cost of capital construction and renovation costs and applicable laws and regulations 

the operatorstenants of our properties compete with properties that provide comparable services in the local markets operatorstenants compete for patients and residents based on a number of factors including quality of care reputation physical appearance of properties location services offered family preferences including a preference for home health services instead of residing in one of our communities physicians staff and price throughout the covid19 pandemic seniors housing operators have experienced broadbased occupancy declines and as a result we expect competition to continue in 2022 and beyond as operators attempt to fill unoccupied units we also face competition from other health care facilities for tenants such as physicians and other health care providers that provide comparable facilities and services

certain government regulations 

united states 

health law matters — generally 

typically operators of seniors housing facilities do not receive significant funding from government programs and are largely subject to state laws as opposed to federal laws operators of longtermpostacute care facilities and hospitals do receive significant funding from government programs and these facilities are subject to extensive regulation including federal and state laws covering the type and quality of medical andor nursing care provided ancillary services  eg  respiratory occupational physical and infusion therapies qualifications of the administrative personnel and nursing staff the adequacy of the physical plant and equipment reimbursement and rate setting and operating policies in addition as described below operators of these facilities are subject to extensive laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including but not limited to the federal antikickback statute “aks” the federal stark law “stark law” and the federal false claims act “fca” as well as comparable state laws hospitals physician group practice clinics and other health care providers that operate in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal state and local licensure registration certification and inspection laws regulations and industry standards as well as other conditions of participation in federal and state government programs such as medicare and medicaid further operators of longterm care facilities are required to have in place compliance and ethics programs that meet the requirements of federal laws and regulations our tenants’ failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in among other things loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension decertification or exclusion from federal and state health care programs loss of license or closure of the facility see risk factors “the requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid could have a material adverse effect on our obligors’ liquidity financial condition and results of operations which could adversely affect our obligors’ ability to meet their obligations to us” and “our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with federal state local and industryregulated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards could adversely affect such operators’ or tenants’ operations which could adversely affect our operators’ and tenants’ ability to meet their obligations to us” in “item 1a – risk factors” below moreover in light of certain arrangements that welltower may pursue with healthcare entities who are directly subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse and given that certain of our arrangements are structured under the provisions of the reit investment diversification and empowerment act of 2007 ridea certain health care fraud and abuse laws and data privacy laws could apply directly to welltower see risk factor we assume operational and legal risks with respect to our properties managed in ridea structures that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in item 1a  risk factors below 

licensing and certification 

the primary regulations that affect seniors housing facilities are state licensing and certification laws for example certain health care facilities are subject to a variety of licensure and certificate of need “con” laws and regulations where applicable con laws generally require among other requirements that a facility demonstrate the need for 1 constructing a new facility 2 adding beds or expanding an existing facility 3 investing in major capital equipment or adding new services 4 changing the ownership or control of an existing licensed facility or 5 terminating services that have been previously approved through the con process certain state con laws and regulations may restrict the ability of operators to add new properties or expand an existing facility’s size or services in addition con laws may constrain the ability of an operator to transfer responsibility for operating a particular facility to a new operator 

with respect to licensure generally our longtermpostacute care facilities are required to be licensed by the applicable state regulatory authority and certified for participation in medicare medicaid and other federal and state health care programs the failure of our operators to maintain or renew any required license or regulatory approval as well as the failure of our operators to correct serious deficiencies identified in a compliance survey could require those operators to discontinue operations at a property in addition if a property is found to be out of compliance with medicare medicaid or other federal or state health care program conditions of participation the property operator may be excluded from participating in those government health care programs 

reimbursement 

the reimbursement methodologies applied to health care facilities continue to evolve federal and state authorities have considered and implemented and may continue seeking to implement new or modified reimbursement methodologies including valuebased reimbursement methodologies that may negatively impact health care property operations likewise thirdparty payors may continue imposing greater controls on operators including through changes in reimbursement rates and fee structures the impact of any such changes if implemented may result in a material adverse effect on our portfolio no assurance can be given that current revenue sources or levels will be maintained accordingly there can be no assurance that payments under a government health care program are currently or will be in the future sufficient to fully reimburse the property operators for their operating and capital expenses 

• seniors housing facilities the majority of the revenues received by the operators of us seniors housing facilities are from private pay sources the remaining revenue source is primarily medicaid provided under state waiver programs for home and communitybased care there can be no guarantee that a state medicaid program operating pursuant to a waiver will be able to maintain its waiver status rates paid by selfpay residents are set by the facilities and are determined by local market conditions and operating costs generally facilities receive a higher payment per day for a private pay resident than for a medicaid beneficiary who requires a comparable level of care the level of medicaid reimbursement varies from state to state thus the revenues generated by operators of our assisted living facilities may be adversely affected by payor mix acuity level or changes in medicaid eligibility and reimbursement levels 

• longtermpostacute care facilities   the majority of the revenues received by the operators of these facilities are from the medicare and medicaid programs with the balance representing reimbursement payments from private payors and patients consequently changes in federal or state reimbursement policies may adversely affect an operator’s ability to cover its expenses including our rent or debt service longtermpostacute care facilities are subject to periodic pre and postpayment reviews and other audits by federal and state authorities a review or audit of a property operator’s claims could result in recoupments denials or delay of payments in the future due to the significant judgments and estimates inherent in payor settlement accounting no assurance can be given as to the adequacy of any reserves maintained by our property operators to cover potential adjustments to reimbursements or to cover settlements made to payors 

◦ medicare reimbursement generally longtermpostacute care facilities are reimbursed by medicare under prospective payment systems which generally provide reimbursement based upon a predetermined fixed amount per episode of care and are updated by cms an agency of the department of health and human services “hhs” annually there is a risk under these payment systems that costs will exceed the fixed payments or that payments may be set below the costs to provide certain items and services further there is risk that medicare skilled nursing facility snf payment reforms may impact our tenants and operators in addition the hhs office of inspector general has released recommendations to address snf billing practices and medicare payment rates if followed these recommendations regarding snf payment reform may impact our tenants and operators 

◦ medicaid reimbursement   many states reimburse snfs using fixed daily rates which are applied prospectively based on patient acuity and the historical costs incurred in providing patient care in most states medicaid does not fully reimburse the cost of providing services certain states are attempting to slow the rate of medicaid growth by freezing rates or restricting eligibility and benefits in addition medicaid reimbursement rates may decline if state revenues in a particular state are not sufficient to fund budgeted expenditures 

• medicare reimbursement for physicians hospital outpatient departments “hopds” and ambulatory surgical centers “ascs” changes in reimbursement to physicians hopds and ascs may further affect our tenants and operators generally medicare reimburses physicians under the physician fee schedule while hopds and ascs are reimbursed under prospective payment systems the physician fee schedule and the hopd and asc prospective payment systems are updated annually by cms these annual medicare payment regulations have resulted in lower net pay increases than providers of those services have often expected in addition the medicare and children’s health insurance program reauthorization act of 2015 “macra” includes payment reductions for providers who do not meet government quality standards the implementation of payforquality models like those required under macra has the potential to produce funding disparities that could adversely impact some provider tenants in outpatient medical buildings and other health care properties changes in medicare advantage plan payments may also indirectly affect our operators and tenants that contract with medicare advantage plans 

• health reform laws the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the “health reform laws” dramatically altered how health care is delivered and reimbursed in the us and contained various provisions including medicaid expansion and the establishment of health insurance exchanges “hies” providing subsidized health insurance that may directly impact us or the operators and tenants of our properties the status of the health reform laws may be subject to change as a result of political legislative regulatory and administrative developments and judicial proceedings while there have been multiple attempts to repeal or amend the health reform laws through legislative action and legal challenges legislative attempts to completely repeal the health reform laws have been unsuccessful to date and on june 17 2021 the us supreme court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the health reform laws brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the health reform laws nevertheless the status of the health reform laws may be subject to change and other health reform measures could be implemented as a result of political legislative regulatory and administrative developments and judicial proceedings further the impact that the biden administration or us congress may have on health reform including through new legislative executive order or regulatory efforts remains uncertain and any changes will likely take time to unfold and could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for health care items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the health reform laws we cannot predict whether the existing health reform laws or future health care reform legislation executive order or regulatory changes will have a material impact on our operators’ or tenants’ property or business 

fraud  abuse enforcement 

longtermpostacute care facilities and seniors housing facilities that receive medicaid payments are subject to federal state and local laws regulations and applicable guidance that govern the operations and financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by health care providers certain of these laws such as the aks and stark law prohibit direct or indirect payments of any kind for the purpose of inducing or encouraging the referral of patients for medical products or services reimbursable by government health care programs other government health program laws require providers to furnish only medically necessary services and submit to the government valid and accurate statements for each service our operators and tenants that receive payments from federal health care programs such as medicare and medicaid are subject to substantial financial penalties under the civil monetary penalties act and the fca upon a finding of noncompliance with such laws in addition states may also have separate false claims acts which among other things generally prohibit health care providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payments federal and state fcas contain whistleblower provisions that permit private individuals to bring health care fraud enforcement claims on behalf of the government still other laws require providers to comply with a variety of safety health and other requirements relating to the condition of the licensed property and the quality of care provided sanctions for violations of these laws regulations and other applicable guidance may include but are not limited to criminal andor civil penalties and fines loss of licensure immediate termination of government payments exclusion from any government health care program damage assessments and imprisonment in certain circumstances violation of these rules such as those prohibiting abusive and fraudulent behavior with respect to one property may subject other facilities under common control or ownership to sanctions including exclusion from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs as well as other government health care programs and revocation of healthcare licenses in the ordinary course of its business a property operator is regularly subjected to inquiries investigations and audits by the federal and state agencies that oversee these laws and regulations 

prosecutions investigations or whistleblower actions could have a material adverse effect on a property operator’s liquidity financial condition and operations which could adversely affect the ability of the operator to meet its financial obligations to us in addition government investigations and enforcement actions brought against the health care industry have increased dramatically over the past several years and are expected to continue the costs for an operator of a health care property associated with both defending such enforcement actions and the undertakings in settling these actions can be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its obligations to us in addition welltower could potentially be directly subject to these health care fraud and abuse laws as well as potential investigation or enforcement as a result of our rideastructured arrangements and certain collaboration or other arrangements we may pursue with stakeholders who are directly subject to these laws 

federal and state data privacy and security laws 

the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” as amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act and numerous other state and federal laws govern the collection security dissemination use access to and confidentiality of personal information including individually identifiable health information violations of these laws may result in substantial civil andor criminal fines and penalties the costs to a business such as ours or to an operator of a health care property associated with developing and maintaining programs and systems to comply with data privacy and security laws defending against privacy and security related claims or enforcement actions and paying any assessed fines can be substantial moreover such costs could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its obligations to us finally data privacy and security laws and regulations continue to develop including with regard to hipaa and us state privacy laws such as the california consumer privacy act and the new california privacy rights act and other similar laws in colorado and virginia that will go into effect in 2023 as we use data to better inform our investments and the efficacy of care in our communities these developments may add potential uncertainty and costs towards compliance obligations business operations or transactions that depend on data these new privacy laws may create restrictions or requirements in our our operators and other business partners use sharing and securing of data new privacy and security laws could require substantial investment in resources to comply with regulatory changes as privacy and security laws proliferate in divergent ways or impose additional obligations and potentially create new privacy related legal risks

general 

we elected to be taxed as a reit commencing with our first taxable year we intend to continue to operate in such a manner as to qualify as a reit but there is no guarantee that we will qualify or remain qualified as a reit for subsequent years qualification and taxation as a reit depends upon our ability to meet a variety of qualification tests imposed under us federal income tax law with respect to our income assets distributions and share ownership as discussed below under “qualification as a reit” there can be no assurance that we will qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

in any year in which we qualify as a reit in general we will not be subject to us federal income tax on that portion of our reit taxable income or capital gain that is distributed to stockholders we may however be subject to tax at normal corporate rates on any taxable income or capital gain not distributed if we elect to retain and pay income tax on our net capital gain stockholders would be taxed on their proportionate share of our undistributed net capital gain and would receive a refundable credit for their share of any taxes paid by us on such gain 

despite the reit election we may be subject to us federal income and excise tax as follows 

• to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our “reit taxable income” as adjusted we will be subject to tax on the undistributed amount at regular corporate tax rates 

• if we have net income from the sale or other disposition of “foreclosure property” that is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business or other nonqualifying income from foreclosure property such income will be taxed at the highest corporate rate 

• any net income from prohibited transactions which are in general sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business other than dispositions of foreclosure property will be subject to a 100 tax 

• if we fail to satisfy either the 75 or 95 gross income tests as discussed below but nonetheless maintain our qualification as a reit because certain other requirements are met we will be subject to a 100 tax on an amount equal to 1 the gross income attributable to the greater of i 75 of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75 gross income test discussed below or ii 95 of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 95 gross income test discussed below multiplied by 2 a fraction intended to reflect our profitability 

• if we fail to distribute during each year at least the sum of 1 85 of our reit ordinary income for the year 2 95 of our reit capital gain net income for such year other than capital gain that we elect to retain and pay tax on and 3 any undistributed taxable income from preceding periods we will be subject to a 4 excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over amounts actually distributed and 

• we will be subject to a 100 tax on certain amounts from certain transactions involving our “taxable reit subsidiaries” that are not conducted on an arm’s length basis see “qualification as a reit  investments in taxable reit subsidiaries 

if we acquire any assets from a corporation which is or has been a “c” corporation in a carryover basis transaction including where a “c” corporation elects reit status we could be liable for specified liabilities that are inherited from the “c” corporation a “c” corporation is generally defined as a corporation that is required to pay full corporate level us federal income tax if we recognize gain on the disposition of the assets during the fiveyear period beginning on the date on which the assets were acquired by us then to the extent of the assets’ “builtin gain” eg the excess of the fair market value of the asset over the adjusted tax basis of the asset in each case determined as of the beginning of the fiveyear period we will be subject to tax on the gain at the highest regular corporate rate applicable the results described in this paragraph with respect to the recognition of builtin gain assume that the “c” corporation did not make and was not treated as making an election to treat the builtin gain assets as sold to an unrelated party for those properties that are subject to the builtin gains tax the potential amount of builtin gains tax will be an additional factor when considering a possible sale of the properties within the fiveyear period beginning on the date on which the properties were acquired by us see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the builtin gains tax 

qualification as a reit 

a reit is defined as a corporation trust or association 

1 which is managed by one or more trustees or directors 

2 the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest 

3 which would be taxable as a domestic corporation but for the us federal income tax law relating to reits 

4 which is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company 

5 the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons in each taxable year of the reit except for its first 

taxable year 

6 not more than 50 in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned during the last half of each taxable year excluding its first taxable year directly indirectly or constructively by or for five or fewer individuals which includes certain entities the “five or fewer requirement” and 

7 which meets certain income and asset tests described below 

conditions 1 to 4 inclusive must be met during the entire taxable year and condition 5 must be met during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months for purposes of conditions 5 and 6 pension funds and certain other taxexempt entities are treated as individuals subject to a “lookthrough” exception in the case of condition 6 

based on publicly available information we believe we have satisfied the share ownership requirements set forth in 5 and 6 above in addition article vi of our bylaws provides for restrictions regarding ownership and transfer of shares these restrictions are intended to assist us in continuing to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in 5 and 6 above but may not ensure that we will in all cases be able to satisfy such requirements 

we have complied with and will continue to comply with regulatory rules to send annual letters to certain of our stockholders requesting information regarding the actual ownership of our stock if despite sending the annual letters we do not know or after exercising reasonable diligence would not have known whether we failed to meet the five or fewer requirement we will be treated as having met the five or fewer requirement if we fail to comply with these regulatory rules we will be subject to a monetary penalty if our failure to comply were due to intentional disregard of the requirement the penalty would be increased however if our failure to comply were due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect no penalty would be imposed 

we may own a number of properties through wholly owned subsidiaries a corporation will qualify as a “qualified reit subsidiary” if 100 of its stock is owned by a reit and the reit does not elect to treat the subsidiary as a taxable reit subsidiary a “qualified reit subsidiary” will not be treated as a separate corporation for us federal income tax purposes and all assets liabilities and items of income deductions and credits of a “qualified reit subsidiary” will be treated as assets liabilities and items as the case may be of the reit for us federal income tax purposes a “qualified reit subsidiary” is not subject to us federal income tax and our ownership of the voting stock of a qualified reit subsidiary will not violate the restrictions against ownership of securities of any one issuer which constitute more than 10 of the value or total voting power of such issuer or more than 5 of the value of our total assets as described below under “ asset tests” 

if we invest in an entity treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes we will be deemed to own a proportionate share of the entity’s assets likewise we will be treated as receiving our share of the income and loss of the entity and the gross income will retain the same character in our hands as it has in the hands of the entity these “lookthrough” rules apply for purposes of the income tests and assets tests described below 

the deduction of business interest is limited to 30 50 in the case of taxable years beginning in 2019 or 2020 of adjusted taxable income which may limit the deductibility of interest expense by us our taxable reit subsidiaries or our joint venture and partnership arrangements a “real property trade or business” may irrevocably elect out of the applicability of the limitation but if it does so it must use the less favorable alternative depreciation system to depreciate real property used in the trade or business regulations provide guidance on how to allocate interest deductions among multiple trades or businesses and contain special rules including a safe harbor regarding the allocation of a reit’s interest deductions to a “real property trade or business” 

income tests there are two separate percentage tests relating to our sources of gross income that we must satisfy each taxable year 

• at least 75 of our gross income excluding gross income from certain sales of property held primarily for sale generally must be directly or indirectly derived each taxable year from “rents from real property” other income from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property or certain income from qualified temporary investments 

• at least 95 of our gross income excluding gross income from certain sales of property held primarily for sale generally must be directly or indirectly derived each taxable year from any of the sources qualifying for the 75 gross income test and from dividends including dividends from taxable reit subsidiaries and interest 

income from hedging and foreign currency transactions is excluded from the 95 and 75 gross income tests if certain requirements are met but otherwise will constitute gross income which does not qualify under the 95 or 75 gross income tests 

rents received by us will qualify as “rents from real property” for purposes of satisfying the gross income tests for a reit only if several conditions are met 

• the amount of rent must not be based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person although rents generally will not be excluded merely because they are based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales 

• rents received from a tenant will not qualify as rents from real property if the reit or an owner of 10 or more of the reit also directly or constructively owns 10 or more of the tenant unless the tenant is our taxable reit subsidiary and certain other requirements are met with respect to the real property being rented 

• if rent attributable to personal property leased in connection with a lease of real property is greater than 15 of the total rent received under the lease then the portion of rent attributable to such personal property will not qualify as “rents from real property” 

• for rents to qualify as rents from real property we generally must not furnish or render services to tenants other than through a taxable reit subsidiary or an “independent contractor” from whom we derive no income except that we may directly provide services that are usually or customarily rendered in the geographic area in which the property is located in connection with the rental of real property for occupancy only or are not otherwise considered rendered to the occupant for his convenience 

• we may lease “qualified health care properties” on an arm’slength basis to a taxable reit subsidiary if the property is operated on behalf of such subsidiary by a person who qualifies as an “independent contractor” and who is or is related to a person who is actively engaged in the trade or business of operating health care facilities for any person unrelated to us or our taxable reit subsidiary such person an “eligible independent contractor” if this is the case the rent that the reit receives from the taxable reit subsidiary generally will be treated as “rents from real property” a “qualified health care property” includes any real property and any personal property that is or is necessary or incidental to the use of a hospital nursing facility assisted living facility congregate care facility qualified continuing care facility or other licensed facility that extends medical or nursing or ancillary services to patients and is operated by a provider of such services that is eligible for participation in the medicare program with respect to such facility 

a reit is permitted to render a de minimis amount of impermissible services to tenants and still treat amounts received with respect to that property as rent from real property the amount received or accrued by the reit during the taxable year for the impermissible services with respect to a property may not exceed 1 of all amounts received or accrued by the reit directly or indirectly from the property the amount received for any service or management operation for this purpose shall be deemed to be not less than 150 of the direct cost of the reit in furnishing or rendering the service or providing the management or operation furthermore impermissible services may be furnished to tenants by a taxable reit subsidiary subject to certain conditions which would permit us to still treat rents received with respect to the property as rent from real property 

the term “interest” generally does not include any amount if the determination of the amount depends in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person although an amount generally will not be excluded from the term “interest” solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage of receipts or sales 

if we fail to satisfy one or both of the 75 or 95 gross income tests for any taxable year we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for such year if we are eligible for certain relief provisions provided by the internal revenue code these relief provisions generally will be available if 1 following our identification of the failure we file a schedule for such taxable year describing each item of our gross income and 2 the failure to meet such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect it is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions if these relief provisions apply a 100 tax is imposed on an amount equal to 1 the gross income attributable to i 75 of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75 income test and ii 95 of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 95 income test multiplied by 2 a fraction intended to reflect our profitability the secretary of the treasury is given broad authority to determine whether particular items of income or gain qualify under the 75 and 95 gross income tests and to exclude items from the measure of gross income for such purposes 

asset tests   within 30 days after the close of each quarter of our taxable year we must also satisfy several tests relating to the nature and diversification of our assets determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles at least 75 of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets including interests in real property interests in mortgages on real property or on interests in real property shares in other reits and debt instruments issued by publicly offered reits cash cash items including receivables arising in the ordinary course of our operation government securities and qualified temporary investments although the remaining 25 of our assets generally may be invested without restriction we are prohibited from owning securities representing more than 10 of either the vote the “10 vote test” or value the “10 value test” of the outstanding securities of any issuer other than a qualified reit subsidiary another reit or a taxable reit subsidiary further no more than 20 of our total assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries the “20 asset test” and no more than 5 of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities of any nongovernmental issuer other than a qualified reit subsidiary the “5 asset test” another reit or a taxable reit subsidiary each of the 10 vote test the 10 value test and the 20 and 5 asset tests must be satisfied at the end of each quarter there are special rules which provide relief if the valuerelated tests are not satisfied due to changes in the value of the assets of a reit 

certain items are excluded from the 10 value test including 1 straight debt securities meeting certain requirements 2 any loan to an individual or an estate 3 any rental agreement described in section 467 of the internal revenue code other than with a “related person” 4 any obligation to pay rents from real property 5 certain securities issued by a state or any subdivision thereof the district of columbia a foreign government or any political subdivision thereof or the commonwealth of puerto rico 6 any security issued by a reit and 7 any other arrangement that as determined by the secretary of the treasury is excepted from the definition of security “excluded securities” if a reit or its taxable reit subsidiary holds 1 straight debt securities of a corporate or partnership issuer and 2 securities of such issuer that are not excluded securities and 

have an aggregate value greater than 1 of such issuer’s outstanding securities the straight debt securities will be included in the 10 value test 

a reit’s interest as a partner in a partnership is not treated as a security for purposes of applying the 10 value test to securities issued by the partnership further any debt instrument issued by a partnership that is not an excluded security will not be a security for purposes of applying the 10 value test 1 to the extent of the reit’s interest as a partner in the partnership or 2 if at least 75 of the partnership’s gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions would qualify for the 75 gross income test for purposes of the 10 value test a reit’s interest in a partnership’s assets is determined by the reit’s proportionate interest in any securities issued by the partnership other than the excluded securities described in the preceding paragraph 

if a reit or its “qualified business unit” uses a foreign currency as its functional currency the term “cash” includes such foreign currency but only to the extent such foreign currency is i held for use in the normal course of the activities of the reit or “qualified business unit” which give rise to items of income or gain that are included in the 95 and 75 gross income tests or are directly related to acquiring or holding assets qualifying under the 75 asset test and ii not held in connection with dealing or engaging in substantial and regular trading in securities 

with respect to corrections of failures as to violations of the 10 vote test the 10 value test or the 5 asset test a reit may avoid disqualification as a reit by disposing of sufficient assets to cure a violation due to the ownership of assets that do not exceed the lesser of 1 of the reit’s assets at the end of the relevant quarter or 10000000 provided that the disposition occurs within six months following the last day of the quarter in which the reit first identified the assets for violations of any of the reit asset tests due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that exceed the thresholds described in the preceding sentence a reit can avoid disqualification as a reit after the close of a taxable quarter by taking certain steps including disposition of sufficient assets within the six month period described above to meet the applicable asset test paying a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets during the period of time that the assets were held as nonqualifying assets and filing a schedule with the internal revenue service that describes the nonqualifying assets 

investments in taxable reit subsidiaries reits may own more than 10 of the voting power and value of securities in taxable reit subsidiaries unlike a qualified reit subsidiary other disregarded entity or partnership the income and assets of a taxable reit subsidiary are not attributable to the reit for purposes of satisfying the income and asset ownership requirements applicable to reit qualification we and any taxable corporate entity in which we own an interest are allowed to jointly elect to treat such entity as a “taxable reit subsidiary” 

certain of our subsidiaries have elected taxable reit subsidiary status taxable reit subsidiaries are subject to full corporate level us federal taxation on their earnings but are permitted to engage in certain types of activities that cannot be performed directly by reits without jeopardizing their reit status our taxable reit subsidiaries will attempt to minimize the amount of these taxes but there can be no assurance whether or the extent to which measures taken to minimize taxes will be successful to the extent our taxable reit subsidiaries are required to pay us federal state or local taxes the cash available for distribution as dividends to us from our taxable reit subsidiaries will be reduced 

the internal revenue service may redetermine amounts from transactions between a reit and its taxable reit subsidiary where there is a lack of arm’slength dealing between the parties any taxable income allocated to or deductible expenses allocated away from a taxable reit subsidiary would increase its tax liability further certain amounts from certain transactions involving a reit and its taxable reit subsidiaries could be subject to a 100 tax if not conducted on an arm’s length basis additional taxable reit subsidiary elections may be made in the future for additional entities in which we obtain an interest 

annual distribution requirements in order to avoid being taxed as a regular corporation we are required to make distributions other than capital gain distributions to our stockholders which qualify for the dividends paid deduction in an amount at least equal to 1 the sum of i 90 of our “reit taxable income” computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain and ii 90 of the aftertax net income if any from foreclosure property minus 2 a portion of certain items of noncash income these distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for that year and if paid on or before the first regular distribution payment after such declaration prior to 2014 with respect to all reits the amount distributed could not be preferential this means that every stockholder of the class of stock to which a distribution is made must be treated the same as every other stockholder of that class and no class of stock may be treated otherwise than in accordance with its dividend rights as a class the “preferential dividend rule” beginning in tax years after 2014 the preferential dividend rule no longer applies to publicly offered reits however the rule is still applicable to other entities taxed as reits which would include several of our subsidiaries to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our “reit taxable income” as adjusted we will be subject to tax on the undistributed amount at regular corporate tax rates as discussed above we may be subject to an excise tax if we fail to meet certain other distribution requirements we believe we have satisfied the annual distribution requirements for the year of our initial reit election and each year thereafter through the 

year ended december 31 2021 although we intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy these annual distribution requirements for subsequent years economic market legal tax or other factors could limit our ability to meet those requirements see “item 1a  risk factors” 

it is also possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90 distribution requirement or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation due to among other things 1 timing differences between i the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses and ii the inclusion of income and deduction of expenses in arriving at our taxable income or 2 the payment of severance benefits that may not be deductible to us in the event that timing differences occur we may find it necessary to arrange for borrowings or if possible pay dividends in the form of taxable stock dividends in order to meet the distribution requirement 

under certain circumstances including in the event of a deficiency determined by the internal revenue service we may be able to rectify a resulting failure to meet the distribution requirement for a year by paying “deficiency dividends” to stockholders in a later year which may be included in our deduction for distributions paid for the earlier year thus we may be able to avoid being disqualified as a reit andor taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends however we will be required to pay applicable penalties and interest based upon the amount of any deduction taken for deficiency dividend distributions 

failure to qualify as a reit 

if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to us federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates distributions to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify as a reit will not be deductible nor will any particular amount of distributions be required to be made in any year all distributions to stockholders will be taxable as dividends to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these distributions and subject to certain limitations will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporate stockholders unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions we also will be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to statutory relief failure to qualify for even one year could result in our need to incur indebtedness or liquidate investments in order to pay potentially significant resulting tax liabilities 

in addition to the relief described above under “income tests” and “asset tests” relief is available in the event that we violate a provision of the internal revenue code that would result in our failure to qualify as a reit if 1 the violation is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect 2 we pay a penalty of 50000 for each failure to satisfy the provision and 3 the violation does not include a violation described under “income tests” or “asset tests” above it is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions 

us federal income taxation of holders of our stock 

treatment of taxable us stockholders the following summary applies to you only if you are a “us stockholder” a “us stockholder” is a holder of shares of stock who for us federal income tax purposes is 

• a citizen or resident of the united states 

• an entity classified as a corporation or partnership created or organized in or under the laws of the united states or of any political subdivision of the united states including any state 

• an estate the income of which is subject to us federal income taxation regardless of its source or 

• a trust if in general a us court is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or more us persons within the meaning of the internal revenue code has the authority to control all of the trust’s substantial decisions 

so long as we qualify for taxation as a reit distributions on shares of our stock made out of the current or accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these distributions and not designated as capital gain dividends will be taxable as dividends for us federal income tax purposes none of these distributions will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for us corporate stockholders 

generally the current maximum marginal rate of tax payable by individuals on dividends received from corporations that are subject to a corporate level of tax is 20 except in limited circumstances this tax rate will not apply to dividends paid to you by us on our shares because generally we are not subject to us federal income tax on the portion of our reit taxable income or capital gains distributed to our stockholders the reduced maximum us federal income tax rate will apply to that portion if any of dividends received by you with respect to our shares that are attributable to 1 dividends received by us from nonreit corporations or other taxable reit subsidiaries 2 income from the prior year with respect to which we were required to pay us federal corporate income tax during the prior year if for example we did not distribute 100 of our reit taxable income for the prior year or 3 the amount of any earnings and profits distributed by us and accumulated in a nonreit year 

although the preferential 20 rate on qualified dividends is generally not applicable to dividends to our shareholders the internal revenue code provides for a deduction from income for individuals trusts and estates for 20 of taxable reit 

dividends not eligible for the preferential rate excluding capital gain dividends this deduction is not taken into account for purposes of determining the 38 tax on net investment income described below and unlike the preferential rate expires after 2025 

distributions that are designated as capital gain dividends will be taxed as longterm capital gains to the extent they do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year without regard to the period for which you held our stock however if you are a corporation you may be required to treat a portion of some capital gain dividends as ordinary income 

if we elect to retain and pay income tax on any net capital gain and designate such amount in a timely notice to you you would include in income as longterm capital gain your proportionate share of this net capital gain you would also receive a refundable tax credit for your proportionate share of the tax paid by us on such retained capital gains and you would have an increase in the basis of your shares of our stock in an amount equal to your includable capital gains less your share of the tax deemed paid 

you may not include in your us federal income tax return any of our net operating losses or capital losses us federal income tax rules may also require that certain minimum tax adjustments and preferences be apportioned to you in addition any distribution declared by us in october november or december of any year on a specified date in any such month shall be treated as both paid by us and received by you on december 31 of that year provided that the distribution is actually paid by us no later than january 31 of the following year 

we will be treated as having sufficient earnings and profits to treat as a dividend any distribution up to the amount required to be distributed in order to avoid imposition of the 4 excise tax discussed under “general” and “qualification as a reit  annual distribution requirements” above as a result you may be required to treat as taxable dividends certain distributions that would otherwise result in a taxfree return of capital moreover any “deficiency dividend” will be treated as a dividend an ordinary dividend or a capital gain dividend as the case may be regardless of our earnings and profits any other distributions in excess of current or accumulated earnings and profits will generally not be taxable to you to the extent these distributions do not exceed the adjusted tax basis of your shares of our stock you will be required to reduce the tax basis of your shares of our stock by the amount of these distributions until the basis has been reduced to zero after which these distributions will be taxable as capital gain if the shares of our stock are held as capital assets the tax basis as so reduced will be used in computing the capital gain or loss if any realized upon the sale of the shares of our stock any loss upon a sale or exchange of shares of our stock which were held for six months or less after application of certain holding period rules will generally be treated as a longterm capital loss to the extent you previously received capital gain distributions with respect to these shares of our stock 

upon the sale or exchange of any shares of our stock to or with a person other than us or a sale or exchange of all shares of our stock whether actually or constructively owned with us you will generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your adjusted tax basis in these shares of our stock this gain or loss will be capital gain or loss if you held these shares of our stock as a capital asset 

if we redeem any of your shares in us the treatment can only be determined on the basis of particular facts at the time of redemption in general you will recognize gain or loss as opposed to dividend income equal to the difference between the amount received by you in the redemption and your adjusted tax basis in your shares redeemed if such redemption 1 results in a “complete termination” of your interest in all classes of our equity securities 2 is a “substantially disproportionate redemption” or 3 is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” with respect to you in applying these tests you must take into account your ownership of all classes of our equity securities eg common stock preferred stock depositary shares and warrants you also must take into account any equity securities that are considered to be constructively owned by you 

if as a result of a redemption by us of your shares you no longer own either actually or constructively any of our equity securities or only own actually and constructively an insubstantial percentage of our equity securities then it is probable that the redemption of your shares would be considered “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” and thus would result in gain or loss to you however whether a distribution is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” depends on all of the facts and circumstances and if you rely on any of these tests at the time of redemption you should consult your tax advisor to determine their application to the particular situation 

generally if the redemption does not meet the tests described above then the proceeds received by you from the redemption of your shares will be treated as a distribution taxable as a dividend to the extent of the allocable portion of current or accumulated earnings and profits if the redemption is taxed as a dividend your adjusted tax basis in the redeemed shares will be transferred to any other shareholdings in us that you own if you own no other shareholdings in us under certain circumstances such basis may be transferred to a related person or it may be lost entirely 

gain from the sale or exchange of our shares held for more than one year is generally taxed at a maximum longterm capital gain rate of 20 in the case of stockholders who are individuals and 21 in the case of stockholders that are corporations pursuant to internal revenue service guidance we may classify portions of our capital gain dividends as eligible for specific treatment provided under the internal revenue code which depending on the nature of the capital gains may result in taxation of such portions at rates of either 20 or 25 capital losses recognized by a stockholder upon the disposition of our shares 

held for more than one year at the time of disposition will be considered longterm capital losses the deduction for capital losses is subject to limitations 

an additional tax of 38 generally will be imposed on the “net investment income” of us stockholders who meet certain requirements and are individuals estates or certain trusts among other items “net investment income” generally includes gross income from dividends and net gain attributable to the disposition of certain property such as shares of our common stock or warrants in the case of individuals this tax will only apply to the extent such individual’s modified adjusted gross income exceeds 200000 250000 for married couples filing a joint return and surviving spouses and 125000 for married individuals filing a separate return us stockholders should consult their tax advisors regarding the possible applicability of this additional tax in their particular circumstances 

treatment of taxexempt us stockholders taxexempt entities including qualified employee pension and profit sharing trusts and individual retirement accounts “exempt organizations” generally are exempt from us federal income taxation however they are subject to taxation on their unrelated business taxable income “ubti” the internal revenue service has issued a published revenue ruling that dividend distributions from a reit to an exempt employee pension trust do not constitute ubti provided that the shares of the reit are not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business of the exempt employee pension trust based on this ruling amounts distributed by us to exempt organizations generally should not constitute ubti however if an exempt organization finances its acquisition of the shares of our stock with debt a portion of its income from us will constitute ubti pursuant to the “debt financed property” rules likewise a portion of the exempt organization’s income from us would constitute ubti if we held a residual interest in a real estate mortgage investment conduit a taxexempt us stockholder that is subject to tax on its ubti will be required to segregate its taxable income and loss for each unrelated trade or business activity for purposes of determining its ubti 

backup withholding and information reporting under certain circumstances you may be subject to backup withholding at applicable rates on payments made with respect to or cash proceeds of a sale or exchange of shares of our stock backup withholding will apply only if you 1 fail to provide a correct taxpayer identification number which if you are an individual is ordinarily your social security number 2 furnish an incorrect taxpayer identification number 3 are notified by the internal revenue service that you have failed to properly report payments of interest or dividends or 4 fail to certify under penalties of perjury that you have furnished a correct taxpayer identification number and that the internal revenue service has not notified you that you are subject to backup withholding 

backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients such as corporations and taxexempt organizations you should consult with a tax advisor regarding qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining an exemption backup withholding is not an additional tax rather the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a stockholder will be allowed as a credit against such stockholder’s us federal income tax liability and may entitle such stockholder to a refund provided that the required information is provided to the internal revenue service 

taxation of foreign stockholders the following summary applies to you only if you are a foreign person a “foreign person” is a holder of shares of stock who for us federal income tax purposes is not a us stockholder the us federal taxation of foreign persons is a highly complex matter that may be affected by many considerations 

except as discussed below distributions to you of cash generated by our real estate operations in the form of ordinary dividends but not by the sale or exchange of our capital assets generally will be subject to us withholding tax at a rate of 30 unless an applicable tax treaty reduces that tax and you file with us the required form evidencing the lower rate 

in general you will be subject to us federal income tax on a graduated rate basis rather than withholding with respect to your investment in our stock if such investment is “effectively connected” with your conduct of a trade or business in the united states a corporate foreign stockholder that receives income that is or is treated as effectively connected with a united states trade or business may also be subject to the branch profits tax which is payable in addition to regular united states corporate income tax the following discussion will apply to foreign stockholders whose investment in us is not so effectively connected we expect to withhold united states income tax as described below on the gross amount of any distributions paid to you unless 1 you file an internal revenue service form w8eci with us claiming that the distribution is “effectively connected” or 2 certain other exceptions apply 

distributions by us that are attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a united states real property interest will be taxed to you under the foreign investment in real property tax act of 1980 “firpta” as if these distributions were gains “effectively connected” with a united states trade or business accordingly you will be taxed at the normal capital gain rates applicable to a us stockholder on these amounts subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals distributions subject to firpta may also be subject to a branch profits tax in the hands of a corporate foreign stockholder that is not entitled to treaty exemption we will be required to withhold tax at a rate of 21 from distributions subject to firpta we will be required to withhold from distributions subject to firpta and remit to the internal revenue service 21 of designated capital gain dividends or if greater 21 of the amount of any distributions that could be designated as capital gain dividends in addition if we designate prior distributions as 

capital gain dividends subsequent distributions up to the amount of the prior distributions not withheld against will be treated as capital gain dividends for purposes of withholding 

any capital gain dividend with respect to any class of stock that is “regularly traded” on an established securities market will be treated as an ordinary dividend if the foreign stockholder did not own more than 10 of such class of stock at any time during the taxable year foreign stockholders generally will not be required to report distributions received from us on us federal income tax returns and all distributions received by such stockholders treated as dividends for us federal income tax purposes including any such capital gain dividends will be subject to a 30 us withholding tax unless reduced under an applicable income tax treaty as discussed above in addition the branch profits tax will not apply to such distributions 

unless our shares constitute a “united states real property interest” within the meaning of firpta or are effectively connected with a us trade or business a sale of our shares by you generally will not be subject to united states taxation even if our shares were to constitute a “united states real property interest” nonus stockholders that are “qualified foreign pension funds” or are owned by a qualified foreign pension fund meeting certain requirements may be exempt from firpta withholding on the sale or disposition of our shares our shares will not constitute a united states real property interest if we qualify as a “domestically controlled reit” we believe that we qualify as and expect to continue to qualify as a domestically controlled reit a domestically controlled reit is a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50 in value of its shares is held directly or indirectly by foreign stockholders generally we are permitted to assume that holders of less than 5 of our shares at all times during a specified testing period are us persons however if you are a nonresident alien individual who is present in the united states for 183 days or more during the taxable year and certain other conditions apply you will be subject to a 30 tax on such capital gains in any event a purchaser of our shares from you will not be required under firpta to withhold on the purchase price if the purchased shares are “regularly traded” on an established securities market or if we are a domestically controlled reit otherwise under firpta the purchaser may be required to withhold 15 of the purchase price and remit such amount to the internal revenue service 

backup withholding tax and information reporting will generally not apply to distributions paid to you outside the united states that are treated as 1 dividends to which the 30 or lower treaty rate withholding tax discussed above applies 2 capital gains dividends or 3 distributions attributable to gain from the sale or exchange by us of us real property interests payment of the proceeds of a sale of stock within the united states or conducted through certain us related financial intermediaries is subject to both backup withholding and information reporting unless the beneficial owner certifies under penalties of perjury that he or she is not a us person and the payor does not have actual knowledge that the beneficial owner is a us person or otherwise establishes an exemption you may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for refund with the internal revenue service

current and prospective securities holders should recognize that the present us federal income tax treatment of an investment in us may be modified by legislative judicial or administrative action at any time and that any such action may affect investments and commitments previously made the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the internal revenue service and the department of the treasury resulting in revisions of regulations and revised interpretations of established concepts as well as statutory changes revisions in us federal tax laws and interpretations of these laws could adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in us 

state local and foreign taxes 

we and holders of our debt and equity securities may be subject to state local or foreign taxation in various jurisdictions including those in which we or they transact business own property or reside it should be noted that we own properties located in a number of state local and foreign jurisdictions and may be required to file tax returns in some or all of those jurisdictions the state local or foreign tax treatment of us and holders of our debt and equity securities may not conform to the us federal income tax consequences discussed above consequently you are urged to consult your advisor regarding the application and effect of state local and foreign tax laws with respect to any investment in our securities 

because the us generally maintains a worldwide corporate tax system the foreign and us tax systems are somewhat interdependent longstanding international tax norms that determine each country’s jurisdiction to tax crossborder international trade are evolving and could reduce the ability of our foreign subsidiaries to deduct for foreign tax purposes the interest they pay on loans from the company thereby increasing the foreign tax liability of the subsidiaries it is also possible that foreign countries could increase their withholding taxes on dividends and interest given the unpredictability of these 

possible changes and their potential interdependency it is very difficult to assess the overall effect of such potential tax changes on our earnings and cash flow but such changes could adversely impact our financial results

risks factors 

this section highlights significant factors events and uncertainties that could create risk with an investment in our securities the events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could in circumstances we may not be able to accurately predict recognize or control have a material adverse effect on our business growth reputation prospects financial condition operating results cash flows liquidity ability to pay dividends and stock price these risk factors do not identify all risks that we face our operations could also be affected by factors events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations we group these risk factors into three categories 

• risks arising from our business 

• risks arising from our capital structure and 

• risks arising from our status as a reit 

risks arising from our business 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic may continue to adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are unable to accurately predict the full impact that the covid19 pandemic will have on our results of operations financial condition liquidity and cash flows due to numerous factors that are not within our control these factors include the duration and severity of the outbreak including the impact of new variants the continued deployment of vaccines and boosters the effectiveness of vaccines and boosters over time and against new variants public health measures such as business closures and stayathome orders and other actions taken by governments businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic the availability of federal state local or nonus funding programs general economic disruption and uncertainty in key markets and financial market volatility and the impact of the covid19 pandemic on general macroeconomic conditions and the pace of recovery when the pandemic subsides 

the covid19 pandemic has subjected our business operations and financial condition to a number of risks including but not limited to those discussed below 

• risks related to revenue our revenues and our operators revenues are dependent on occupancy our seniors housing operating portfolio has experienced a decline in spot occupancy from 858 at february 29 2020 to 762 at december 31 2020 and 777 at december 31 2021 although the ongoing impact of the pandemic including new variants and vaccine and booster deployment on occupancy remain uncertain occupancy of our seniors housing operating and triplenet properties could further decrease including as a result of new variants or decreases in vaccine effectiveness over time such a decrease could affect the net operating income of our seniors housing operating properties and the ability of our triplenet operators to make contractual payments to us in addition 

although we collected virtually all rent due in the fourth quarter of 2021 rental income in our outpatient medical segment may decrease if our tenants do not renew leases or do not make timely or full lease payments as a result of medical practice closures or decreases in revenue due to government imposed restrictions on elective medical procedures or decisions by patients to delay treatments as a result of the financial impact of the covid19 pandemic on our operators and tenants we may offer certain tenants concessions such as rent deferrals or rent abatements across our triplenet and outpatient medical segments 

• risks related to operator and tenant financial condition in addition to decreased revenue from tenant and operator payments the impact of the covid19 pandemic creates a heightened risk of tenant operator borrower manager or other obligor bankruptcy or insolvency due to factors such as prolonged decreased occupancy medical practice disruptions resulting from stayathome orders increased health and safety and labor expenses or litigation resulting from developments related to the covid19 pandemic see  the insolvency or bankruptcy of our tenants operators borrowers managers and other obligors may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition for more information our ability to terminate our lease with a tenant or management agreement with an operator or manager and relet the property to another tenant or transition to a new operator or manager may be severely limited under current conditions due to the industry and macroeconomic effects of the covid19 pandemic and local ordinances if we cannot transition a leased property to a new tenant operator or manager due to the effects of the covid19 pandemic or for other reasons we may take possession of that property which may expose us to certain successor liabilities publicity about an operators financial condition and insolvency proceedings particularly in light of ongoing publicity related to the covid19 pandemic may also negatively impact their and our reputations decreasing customer demand and revenues additionally covid19 claims have been excluded from insurance policies resulting in uninsured claims and there has been an increase of covid19 class action lawsuits filed that may result in unfavorable verdicts should such events occur our revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely affected 

• risks related to operations across all of our properties we and our operators and tenants have incurred increased operational costs as a result of the introduction of public health measures and other regulations affecting our properties and operations as well as additional health and safety measures adopted by us and our operators and tenants related to the covid19 pandemic including increases in labor and property cleaning expenses and expenditures related to efforts to procure ppe and supplies such operational costs may increase in the future based on the duration and severity of the pandemic or the introduction of additional public health regulations in addition operators and tenants are subject to risks arising from the unique pressures on seniors housing and medical practice employees during the covid19 pandemic including labor shortages resulting from macroeconomic trends as a result of difficult conditions and stresses related to the covid19 pandemic employee morale and productivity may suffer and additional pay such as hazard pay may not be sufficient to retain key operator and tenant employees in addition our operations or those of our operators or tenants may be adversely impacted if a significant number of our employees or those of our operators or tenants contract covid19 although we continue to undertake extensive efforts to ensure the safety of our employees and residents and to provide operator and tenant support in this regard the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our facilities could result in additional operational costs and reputational and litigation risk to us and our operators and tenants as a result of the covid19 pandemic operator and tenant cost of insurance is expected to increase and such insurance may not cover certain claims related to covid19 our exposure to covid19 related litigation risk may be increased if the operators or tenants of the relevant facilities are subject to bankruptcy or insolvency in addition to varying degrees during the course of the pandemic we have experienced increased operational challenges and costs resulting from logistical challenges such as supply chain interruptions business closures and restrictions on the movement of people in response to stayathome orders and to support the health and wellbeing of our employees many of our employees are currently working remote or hybrid schedules the effects of such work arrangements for an extended period of time could impact employee productivity and morale and introduce additional operational risk including but not limited to cybersecurity risks 

• risks related to liquidity if our access to capital is restricted or our borrowing costs increase as a result of developments in financial markets relating to the pandemic our operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted in addition a prolonged period of decreased revenue may adversely affect our financial condition and longterm growth prospects and there can also be no assurance that we will not face credit rating downgrades future downgrades could adversely affect our cost of capital liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets 

the events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could in circumstances we may not be able to accurately predict recognize or control have a material adverse effect on our business growth reputation prospects financial condition operating results cash flows liquidity ability to pay dividends and stock price as the covid19 pandemic continues to adversely affect our operating and financial results it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the risk factors in this annual report on form 10k 

there remains uncertainty regarding the implementation and impact of the cares act and any future stimulus or other covid19 relief legislation there can be no assurance as to the amount of financial assistance we and our operators will receive or that we will be able to comply with the terms and conditions to keep such assistance 

in response to the covid19 pandemic the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act and the paycheck protection program and health care enhancement act ppphce act signed into law on march 20 2020 and april 24 2020 respectively authorized 175 billion in funding to be distributed to healthcare providers including assisted living facilities these funds distributed through the provider relief fund and administered by the department of health and human services are required to be used to prevent prepare for and respond to covid19 and reimburse expenses or lost revenues attributable the covid19 pandemic although these distributions are not subject to repayment attestation and compliance with certain terms and conditions including detailed reporting and auditing are required any funds that are ultimately received and retained by us are not expected to fully offset the losses incurred in our senior living portfolio that are attributable to the covid19 pandemic 

during the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 we received government grants under the cares act primarily to cover increased expenses and lost revenue during the covid19 pandemic as well as under similar programs in the uk and canada for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 we recognized 102575000 and 34941000 respectively of government grant income we have completed applications for grant income under phase 4 of the provider relief fund and expect to receive additional funding during 2022 however there can be no assurances that all of our applications will be approved or that additional funds will ultimately be received in full or in part 

our investments in and acquisitions of health care and seniors housing properties may be unsuccessful or fail to meet our expectations 

some of our acquisitions may not prove to be successful we could encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired properties including contingent liabilities and acquired properties might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business if we agree to provide construction funding to an operatortenant and the project is not completed we may need to take steps to ensure completion of the project such expenditures may negatively affect our results of operations investments in and acquisitions of seniors housing and health care properties entail risks associated with real estate investments generally including risks that the investment will not achieve expected returns that the cost estimates for necessary property improvements will prove inaccurate or that the tenant operator or manager will fail to meet performance expectations furthermore there can be no assurance that our anticipated acquisitions and investments the completion of which is subject to various conditions will be consummated in accordance with anticipated timing on anticipated terms or at all we may be unable to obtain or assume financing for acquisitions on favorable terms or at all health care properties are often highly customizable and the development or redevelopment of such properties may require costly tenantspecific improvements we have experienced delays and disruptions to property redevelopment as a result of supply chain issues and construction material and labor shortages and may experience additional or more significant such delays in the future we also may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties into our existing operations and this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition acquired properties may be located in new markets either within or outside the united states where we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy lack of business relationships in the area costs associated with opening a new regional office and unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures as a result we cannot assure you that we will achieve the economic benefit we expect from acquisitions investment development and redevelopment opportunities and may lead to impairment of such assets 

acquired properties may expose us to unknown liability 

we may acquire properties or invest in joint ventures that own properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse or with only limited recourse against the prior owners or other third parties with respect to unknown liabilities as a result if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties we might have to pay substantial sums to settle or contest it which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow unknown liabilities with respect to acquired properties might include liabilities for cleanup of undisclosed environmental contamination claims by tenants vendors or other persons against the former owners of the properties liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business and claims for indemnification by general partners directors and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties 

competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties 

we may face competition for acquisition opportunities from other wellcapitalized investors including publicly traded and privately held reits private real estate funds domestic and foreign financial institutions life insurance companies sovereign wealth funds pension trusts partnerships and individual investors this competition may adversely affect us by subjecting us to the following risks we may be unable to acquire a desired property because of competition from other wellcapitalized real estate investors and even if we are able to acquire a desired property competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price 

our investments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by our lack of exclusive control over these investments our partners’ insolvency or failure to meet their obligations and disputes between us and our partners   

we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into partnerships or joint ventures with other persons or entities joint venture investments involve risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership including the possibility that our partner might become insolvent refuse to make capital contributions when due or otherwise fail to meet its obligations which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments that our partner might at any time have economic or other business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our interests or goals that we could become engaged in a dispute with our partner which could require us to expend additional resources to resolve such dispute and could have an adverse impact on the operations and profitability of the joint venture that our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests and that our joint venture partners may be structured differently than us for tax purposes which could create conflicts of interest and risks to our reit status in some instances we andor our partner may have the right to trigger a buysell put right or forced sale arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest acquire our partner’s interest or sell the underlying asset at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction our ability to acquire our partner’s interest may be limited if we do not have sufficient cash available borrowing capacity or other capital resources in such event we may be forced to sell our interest in the joint venture when we would otherwise prefer to retain it on the other hand our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted and the market for our interest may be limited andor valued lower than fair market value joint ventures may require us to share decisionmaking authority with our partners which could limit our ability to control the properties in the joint ventures even when we have a controlling interest certain major decisions may require partner approval such as the sale acquisition or financing of a property 

we assume operational and legal risks with respect to our properties managed in ridea structures that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we have entered into various joint ventures that were structured under the provisions of the reit investment diversification and empowerment act of 2007 “ridea” which permits reits to own or partially own “qualified health care properties” in a structure through which we can participate directly in the cash flow of the properties’ operations as compared to receiving only contractual rent payments in compliance with reit requirements a “qualified health care property” includes real property and any personal property that is or is necessary or incidental to the use of a hospital nursing facility assisted living facility congregate care facility qualified continuing care facility or other licensed facility which extends medical or nursing or ancillary services to patients 

under a ridea structure we are required to rely on our operator to manage and operate the property including complying with laws and providing resident care however as the owner of the property under a ridea structure we are responsible for operational and legal risks and liabilities of the property including but not limited to those relating to employment matters of our operators compliance with health care fraud and abuse and other laws governmental reimbursement matters compliance with federal state local and industryrelated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards and litigation involving our properties or residentspatients even though we have limited ability to control or influence our operators’ management of these risks further our taxable reit subsidiary “trs” is generally required to hold the applicable health care license and enroll in the applicable government health care programs eg medicare and medicaid which subjects us to potential liability under various health care regulatory laws penalties for failure to comply with applicable laws may include loss or suspension of licenses and certificates of need certification or accreditation exclusion from government health care programs eg medicare and medicaid administrative sanctions and civil monetary penalties although we have some general oversight approval rights and the right to review operational and financial reporting information our operators are ultimately in control of the daytoday business of the property including clinical decisionmaking and we rely on them to operate the properties in a manner that complies with applicable law 

we are exposed to operational risks with respect to our seniors housing operating properties that could adversely affect our revenue and operations 

we are exposed to various operational risks with respect to our seniors housing operating properties that may increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to generate revenues in addition to operational challenges related to the covid19 pandemic these risks include fluctuations in occupancy experienced during the normal course of business medicare and medicaid reimbursement if applicable and private pay rates economic conditions competition federal state local and industryregulated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards the availability and increases in cost of general and professional liability insurance coverage increases in property taxes state regulation and rights of residents related to entrance fees federal and state housing laws and regulations including rent and eviction restrictions related to the covid19 pandemic and the availability and increases in the cost of labor as a result of unionization or otherwise any one or a combination of these factors may adversely affect our revenue and operations and could eventually lead to impairment of our properties 

we have rights to terminate our management agreements with operators in whole or with respect to specific properties under certain circumstances and we may be unable to replace if our management agreements are terminated or not renewed 

we are parties to longterm management agreements with our seniors housing operating managers pursuant to which they provide comprehensive property management accounting and other services with respect to our seniors housing operating properties we have the ability to terminate any of our management agreements upon the occurrence of certain events such as insolvency relating to such manager and in some cases the failure to meet specific noi targets without curing as well as the occurrence of other events or certain conditions 

we regularly monitor and review our rights and remedies under our management agreements when determining if we will take significant action under those agreements including terminating a manager we consider numerous legal contractual regulatory business and other relevant factors in exercising our rights to terminate or not renew a management agreement we would work with our existing seniors housing operators or potentially new operators to manage the properties however there is no assurance that we would be able to timely source a replacement or that any replacement manager would be effective any transition to a new manager would most likely require regulatory approval and potentially the approval of the holders of any liens on the property the failure to replace on a timely basis as well as the failure to receive these approvals either at all or in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on the properties and our revenue 

decreases in our operators’ or tenants revenues or increases in our operators’ or tenants expenses including as a result of increased labor costs could affect their ability to make payments to us 

we have very limited control over the success or failure of our operators or tenants businesses and at any time an operator or tenant may experience a downturn in their business that weakens their financial condition our operators’ and tenants revenues are primarily driven by occupancy private pay rates and medicare and medicaid reimbursement if applicable expenses are primarily driven by the costs of labor supplies food utilities taxes insurance and rent or debt service revenues from government reimbursement have and may continue to come under pressure due to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls operating costs continue to increase for our operators and tenants in particular our operators and tenants businesses are vulnerable to increases in labor costs resulting from shortages of medical and nonmedical staff a number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to our operators and tenants or labor costs including increased industry competition high employment levels federal unemployment subsidies including unemployment benefits offered in response to the covid19 pandemic increased wages offered by other employers including in other economic sectors vaccine mandates and other government regulations during the covid19 pandemic in many geographic areas the lack of availability of specialized medical personnel experienced senior care professionals and other workers has been a significant operating issue affecting a wide range of healthcare providers and senior care and housing facilities such shortages have and may continue to impact the operations of our operators and tenants resulting in increased labor and operating costs continued labor shortages or cost inflation may impact our operators and tenants abilities to comply with minimum staffing requirements under applicable federal and state regulations failure to comply with these requirements can among other things jeopardize a facilitys compliance with the conditions of participation under relevant state and federal healthcare programs in addition if a facility is determined to be out of compliance with these requirements it may be subject to fines and other regulatory penalties including the suspension of patient admissions the termination of medicaid participation or the suspension or revocation of licenses 

to the extent that any decrease in revenues andor any increase in operating expenses result in an operator or tenant not generating enough cash to make payments to us the credit of our operator or tenant and the value of other collateral would have to be relied upon to the extent the value of such property is reduced we may need to record an impairment for such asset furthermore if we determine to dispose of an underperforming property such sale may result in a loss any such impairment or loss on sale would negatively affect our financial results these risks are magnified where we lease multiple properties to a single operator or tenant under a master lease as a failure or default under a master lease would expose us to these risks across multiple properties although our lease agreements give us the right to exercise certain remedies in the event of default on the obligations owing to us we may determine not to do so if we believe that enforcement of our rights would be more detrimental to our business than seeking alternative approaches 

increased competition and oversupply may affect our operators’ and managers ability to meet their obligations to us   

the operators and managers of our properties compete on a local and regional basis with operators and managers of properties and other health care providers that provide comparable services for residents and patients including on the basis of the scope and quality of care and services provided reputation and financial condition physical appearance of the properties price and location in addition in light of labor shortages for medical and nonmedical workers in many geographic areas our operators and tenants increasingly compete to attract qualified and experienced employees our operators and managers are expected to encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to attract residents and employees or expand their businesses in addition we expect that there will continue to be a more than adequate inventory of seniors housing facilities we cannot be certain that the operators of all of our facilities will be able to achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels that meet our expected yields and fulfill their obligations to us including but not limited to the results of the covid19 pandemic if our operators and managers cannot compete effectively or if there is an oversupply of facilities their financial performance could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

a severe cold and flu season epidemics or any other widespread illnesses could adversely affect the occupancy of our seniors housing operating and triplenet properties 

in addition to the impact of the covid19 pandemic our business and operations are exposed to risks from severe cold and flu seasons or the occurrence of epidemics or any other widespread illnesses our revenues and our operators revenues are dependent on occupancy and the occupancy of our seniors housing operating and triplenet properties could significantly decrease in the event of a severe cold and flu season an epidemic or any other widespread illness such a decrease could affect the operating income of our seniors housing operating properties and the ability of our triplenet operators to make payments to us as experienced during the covid19 pandemic a future flu or other pandemic could significantly increase the cost burdens faced by our operators including if they are required to implement quarantines for residents and adversely affect their ability to meet their obligations to us which would have a material adverse effect on our financial results   

the insolvency or bankruptcy of our tenants operators borrowers managers and other obligors may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition   

we are exposed to the risk that our tenants operators borrowers managers or other obligors may not be able to meet the rent principal and interest or other payments due us which may result in a tenant operator borrower manager or other obligor bankruptcy or insolvency or that a tenant operator borrower manager or other obligor might become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings for other reasons although our operating lease agreements provide us with the right to evict a tenant demand immediate payment of rent and exercise other remedies and our loans provide us with the right to terminate any funding obligation demand immediate repayment of principal and unpaid interest foreclose on the collateral and exercise other remedies the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization a tenant operator borrower manager or other obligor in bankruptcy or subject to insolvency proceedings may be able to limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent in the case of a lease or to receive unpaid principal and interest in the case of a loan and to exercise other rights and remedies in addition if a lease is rejected in a tenant bankruptcy our claim against the tenant may be limited by applicable provisions of the bankruptcy law we may be required to fund certain expenses eg real estate taxes and maintenance to preserve the value of an investment property avoid the imposition of liens on a property andor transition a property to a new tenant in some instances we have terminated our lease with a tenant and relet the property to another tenant in some of those situations we have provided working capital loans to and limited indemnification of the new obligor if we cannot transition a leased property to a new tenant we may take possession of that property which may expose us to certain successor liabilities publicity about the operators financial condition and insolvency proceedings may also negatively impact their and our reputations decreasing customer demand and revenues should such events occur our revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely affected 

we may not be able to timely reinvest our sale proceeds on terms acceptable to us   

from time to time we will have cash available from the proceeds of sales of our securities principal payments on our loans receivable or the sale of properties including nonelective dispositions under the terms of master leases or similar financial support arrangements in order to maintain current revenues and continue generating attractive returns we expect to reinvest these proceeds in a timely manner we compete for real estate investments with a broad variety of potential investors including other health care reits real estate partnerships health care providers health care lenders and other investors including developers banks insurance companies pension funds governmentsponsored entities and private equity firms some of whom may have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do this competition for attractive investments may negatively affect our ability to make timely investments on terms acceptable to us   in addition our ability to execute on our real estate investment strategies may be temporarily disrupted during periods of financial market volatility or real estate and health care industry market uncertainty including as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

the properties managed by sunrise senior living llc “sunrise” account for a significant portion of our revenues and net operating income and any adverse developments in its business or financial condition could adversely affect us 

as of december 31 2021 sunrise managed 110 of our seniors housing operating properties these properties account for a significant portion of our revenues and net operating income under our management agreements we rely on sunrise’s personnel expertise technical resources and information systems proprietary information good faith and judgment to manage our seniors housing operating properties efficiently and effectively we also rely on sunrise to set appropriate resident fees to provide accurate propertylevel financial results for our properties in a timely manner and to otherwise operate them in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations any adverse developments in sunrise’s business or financial condition could impair its ability to manage our properties efficiently and effectively which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition for example we depend on sunrise’s ability to attract and retain skilled management personnel who are responsible for the daytoday operations of our seniors housing operating properties a shortage of nurses or other trained personnel or general inflationary pressures may force sunrise to enhance its pay and benefits packages to compete effectively for such personnel but it may not be able to offset these added costs by increasing the rates charged to residents any increase in labor costs and other property operating expenses any failure by sunrise to attract and retain qualified personnel or significant changes in sunrise’s senior management or equity ownership 

could adversely affect the income we receive from our seniors housing operating properties and have a material adverse effect on us also if sunrise experiences any significant financial legal accounting or regulatory difficulties such difficulties could result in among other things acceleration of its indebtedness impairment of its continued access to capital or the commencement of insolvency proceedings by or against it under the us bankruptcy code which in turn could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition if we determine to sell or transition properties currently managed by sunrise we may experience operational challenges andor significantly declining financial performance for those properties 

we depend on promedica health system promedica for a significant portion of our revenues and any failure inability or unwillingness by them to satisfy obligations under their agreements with us could adversely affect us   

as of december 31 2021 we lease 205 properties to promedica under triplenet leases which account for a significant portion of our revenues we depend on promedica to pay all insurance taxes utilities and maintenance and repair expenses in connection with the leased properties we cannot assure you that promedica will have sufficient assets income and access to financing to enable them to make rental payments to us or to otherwise satisfy their respective obligations under our leases and any failure inability or unwillingness by promedica to do so could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition promedica have also agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses and we cannot assure you that promedica will have sufficient assets income access to financing and insurance coverage to enable them to satisfy their respective indemnification obligations promedicas failure to effectively conduct their operations or to maintain and improve our properties could adversely affect their business reputations and their ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties which in turn could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

ownership of property outside the us may subject us to different or greater risks than those associated with our domestic operations   

we have operations in the uk and canada which represent 117 and 89 of total welltower revenues respectively as of december 31 2021 revera managed 85 of our seniors housing operating properties in canada representing a significant portion of our revenues and also owned a controlling interest in sunrise international development ownership and operating activities involve risks that are different from those we face with respect to our domestic properties and operations these risks include but are not limited to any international currency gain or loss recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates which may not qualify under the 75 gross income test or the 95 gross income test required for us to satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a reit challenges with respect to the repatriation of foreign earnings and cash impact from international trade disputes and the associated impact on our tenants supply chain and consumer spending levels changes in foreign political regulatory and economic conditions regionally nationally and locally including but not limited to challenges in managing international operations challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations including those relating to real estate corporate governance operations taxes employment and other civil and criminal legal proceedings foreign ownership restrictions with respect to operations in foreign countries local businesses and cultural factors that differ from our usual standards and practices differences in lending practices and the willingness of domestic or foreign lenders to provide financing regional or countryspecific business cycles and political and economic instability and failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations in the us that affect foreign operations including but not limited to the us foreign corrupt practices act additionally the covid19 pandemic may subject our international business and that of our operators and tenants to different or greater risks than those faced in the us these factors may include the duration and severity of the outbreak in a particular country due to the impact of new variants the distribution of vaccines and boosters or public health measures or other actions taken by governments businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic 

if our tenants do not renew their existing leases or if we are required to sell properties for liquidity reasons we may be unable to lease or sell the properties on favorable terms or at all 

we cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases at the end of their lease terms which expire at various times if these leases are not renewed we would be required to find other tenants to occupy those properties or sell them there can be no assurance that we would be able to identify suitable replacement tenants or enter into leases with new tenants on terms as favorable to us as the current leases or that we would be able to lease those properties at all our competitors may offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our customers we may lose potential customers and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge to retain customers when leases expire in addition our ability to reposition our properties with a suitable replacement tenant or operator could be significantly delayed or limited by state licensing receivership con or other laws as well as by the medicare and medicaid changeofownership rules and we could incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any licensing receivership or changeofownership proceedings even if tenants decide to renew or lease new space the terms of renewals or new leases including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants may be less favorable to us than current lease terms 

real estate investments are relatively illiquid and most of the property we own is highly customized for specific uses our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in operator economic and other conditions will be limited no assurances can be given that we will recognize full value for any property that we are required to sell our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition we are exposed to the risks inherent in concentrating investments in real estate and in particular the seniors housing and health care industries a downturn in the real estate industry could adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to sell properties for a price or on terms acceptable to us 

our tenants operators and managers may not have the necessary insurance coverage to insure adequately against losses   

we maintain or require our tenants operators and managers to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties and their operations with terms conditions limits and deductibles that we believe are customary for similarly situated companies in our industry and we frequently review our insurance programs and requirements our tenants operators and managers may not be able to maintain adequate levels of insurance and required coverages also we may not be able to require the same levels of insurance coverage under our lease management and other agreements which could adversely affect us in the event of a significant uninsured loss we cannot make any guarantee as to the future financial viability of the insurers that underwrite our policies and the policies maintained by our tenants operators and managers insurance may not be available at a reasonable cost in the future or policies may not be maintained at a level that will fully cover all losses on our properties upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event this may be especially the case due to increases in property insurance costs in addition in recent years longtermpostacute care and seniors housing operators and managers have experienced substantial increases in both the number and size of patient care liability claims as a result general and professional liability costs have increased in some markets due to the uncertainty of the long term effects of the covid19 pandemic general and professional liability insurance coverage may be restricted or very costly which may adversely affect the tenants’ operators’ and managers’ future operations cash flows and financial conditions and may have a material adverse effect on the tenants’ operators’ and managers’ ability to meet their obligations to us finally our use and the usage by some of our tenants operators and managers of selfinsurance andor use of a wholly owned captive insurance company if not adequately funded could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and that of our tenants operators and managers 

our ownership of properties through ground leases exposes us to the loss of such properties upon breach or termination of the ground leases   

we have acquired an interest in certain of our properties by acquiring a leasehold interest in the property on which the building is located and we may acquire additional properties in the future through the purchase of interests in ground leases many of these ground leases impose significant limitations on our uses of the subject properties restrict our ability to sell or otherwise transfer our interests in the properties or restrict the leasing of the properties these restrictions may limit our ability to timely sell or exchange the properties impair the properties’ value or negatively impact our ability to find suitable tenants for the properties as the lessee under a ground lease we are exposed to the possibility of losing the property upon termination of the ground lease or an earlier breach of the ground lease by us 

the requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare medicaid or government funding could have a material adverse effect on our obligors’ liquidity financial condition and results of operations which could adversely affect our obligors’ ability to meet their obligations to us   

some of our obligors’ businesses are affected by government reimbursement to the extent that an operatortenant receives a significant portion of its revenues from government payors primarily medicare and medicaid such revenues may be subject to statutory and regulatory changes retroactive rate adjustments recovery of program overpayments or setoffs court decisions administrative rulings policy interpretations payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers changeofownership rules government funding restrictions at a program level or with respect to specific facilities any lapse in congressional funding of the centers for medicare and medicaid services and interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing government investigations and audits at such property in recent years government payors have frozen or reduced payments to health care providers due to budgetary pressures federal and state authorities may continue seeking to implement new or modified reimbursement methodologies that may negatively impact health care property operations see “item 1  business  certain government regulations  united states  reimbursement” above for additional information health care reimbursement will likely continue to be of paramount importance to federal and state authorities we cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or effect any future legislative reforms may have on the financial condition of our obligors and properties there can be no assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will be available for services provided by any property operator whether the property receives reimbursement from medicare medicaid or private payors significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on an obligor’s liquidity financial condition and results of operations which could adversely affect the ability of an obligor to meet its obligations to us 

since january 1 2014 the health reform laws have provided those states that expand their medicaid coverage to otherwise eligible state residents with incomes at or below 138 of the federal poverty level with an increased federal medical assistance percentage effective january 1 2014 when certain conditions are met given that the federal government substantially funds the medicaid expansion it is unclear how many states will ultimately pursue this option although as of early january 2022 

more than 75 of the states have expanded medicaid coverage the participation by states in the medicaid expansion could have the dual effect of increasing our tenants’ revenues through new patients but further straining state budgets and their ability to pay our tenants 

while there have been multiple attempts to repeal or amend the health reform laws through legislative action and legal challenges legislative attempts to completely repeal the health reform laws have been unsuccessful to date and on june 17 2021 the us supreme court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the health reform laws brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the health reform laws nevertheless the status of the health reform laws may be subject to change and other health reform measures could be implemented as a result of political legislative regulatory and administrative developments and judicial proceedings further impact that the biden administration or us congress may have on health reform including through new legislative executive order or regulatory efforts remains uncertain and any changes will likely take time to unfold and could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for health care items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the health reform laws if the operations cash flows or financial condition of our operators and tenants are materially adversely impacted by the health reform laws or future legislation our revenue and operations may be adversely affected as well more generally and because of the dynamic nature of the legislative and regulatory environment for health care products and services and in light of existing federal deficit and budgetary concerns we cannot predict the impact that broadbased farreaching legislative or regulatory changes could have on the us economy our business or that of our operators and tenants 

if controls imposed on certain of our tenants who provide health care services that are reimbursed by medicare medicaid and other thirdparty payors to reduce admissions and length of stay affect inpatient volumes at our health care facilities the financial condition or results of operations of those tenants could be adversely affected 

controls imposed by medicare medicaid and commercial thirdparty payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay commonly referred to as “utilization reviews” have affected and are expected to continue to affect certain of our health care facilities specifically our acute care hospitals and postacute facilities utilization review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by managed care plans inpatient utilization average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payorrequired preadmission authorization and utilization review and by payor pressures to maximize outpatient and alternative health care delivery services for less acutely ill patients efforts to impose more stringent cost controls and reductions are expected to continue which could negatively impact the financial condition of our tenants who provide health care services in our hospitals and postacute facilities if so this could adversely affect these tenants’ ability and willingness to comply with the terms of their leases with us andor renew those leases upon expiration which could have a material adverse effect on us 

our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with federal state province local and industryregulated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards could adversely affect such operators’ or tenants’ operations which could adversely affect our operators’ and tenants’ ability to meet their obligations to us   

our operators and tenants generally are subject to or impacted by varying levels of federal state local and industryregulated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards these laws and regulations include among others laws protecting consumers against deceptive practices laws relating to the operation of our properties and how our tenants and operators conduct their business such as fire health and safety data security and privacy laws federal and state laws affecting hospitals clinics and other health care communities that participate in both medicare and medicaid that specify reimbursement rates pricing reimbursement procedures and limitations quality of services and care background checks food service and physical plants and similar foreign laws regulating the health care industry resident rights laws including abuse and neglect laws and fraud laws antikickback and physician referral laws the ada and similar state and local laws and safety and health standards set by the occupational safety and health administration or similar foreign agencies our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with any of these laws regulations or standards could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension decertification or exclusion from federal and state health care programs civil liability and in certain limited instances criminal penalties material restrictions on or loss of license closure of the facility andor the incurrence of considerable costs arising from an investigation or regulatory action the likelihood of these actions may increase due to the uncertainty of the long term effects of the covid19 pandemic such actions may have an effect on our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make lease payments to us and therefore adversely impact us in addition we may be directly subject to these laws regulations and standards as well as potential investigation or enforcement as a result of our rideastructured arrangements and certain other arrangements we may pursue with healthcare entities who are directly subject to these laws see “item 1  business  certain government regulations  united states  fraud  abuse enforcement” and “item 1  business  certain government regulations  united states  health care matters  generally” above 

many of our properties may require a license registration andor con to operate failure to obtain a license registration or con or loss of a required license registration or con would prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by the operators or tenants these events could materially adversely affect our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make rent or other obligatory payments to us state and local laws also may regulate the expansion including the addition of new beds or services or acquisition of medical equipment and the construction or renovation of health care facilities by requiring a con or other 

similar approval from a state agency see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — united states — licensing and certification” above 

in addition we cannot assure you that future changes in government regulation will not adversely affect the health care industry including our tenants and operators nor can we be certain that our tenants and operators will achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels or labor cost levels that will enable them to satisfy their obligations to us 

unfavorable resolution of pending and future litigation matters and disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

from time to time we are directly involved or named as a party in in legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims that involve class actions disputes regarding property damage care matters and other issues we also are named as defendants in lawsuits allegedly arising out of our actions or the actions of our operatorstenants or managers in which such operatorstenants or managers have agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses employment related class action lawsuits have increased in recent years including but not limited to class action lawsuits brought against our operators in certain states regarding employee and government requirements regarding wage and hour claims and fair housing complaints as well as class action lawsuits related to covid19 there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail in or achieve a favorable settlement of pending or future litigation in addition pending litigation or future litigation government proceedings or environmental matters could lead to increased costs or interruption of our normal business operations an unfavorable resolution of pending or future litigation or legal proceedings may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition regardless of its outcome litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses significantly divert the attention of management and could damage our reputation and our brand in addition any such resolution could involve our agreement to terms that restrict the operation of our business we cannot guarantee losses incurred in connection with any current or future legal or regulatory proceedings or actions will not exceed any provisions we may have set aside in respect of such proceedings or actions or will not exceed any available insurance coverage 

development redevelopment and construction risks could affect our profitability 

we invest in various development and redevelopment projects in deciding whether to acquire or develop a particular property we make assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property in particular we estimate the return on our investment based on expected construction costs lease up velocity occupancy rental rates operating expenses capital costs and future competition if our financial projections with respect to a new property are inaccurate the property may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment our estimate of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove to be inaccurate which may result in our failure to meet our profitability goals 

our developmentredevelopment and construction projects are vulnerable to the impact of material shortages and inflation for example shortages and fluctuations in the price of lumber or in other important raw materials could result in delays in the start or completion of or increase the cost of developing one or more of our projects pricing for labor and raw materials can be affected by various national regional local economic and political factors including changes to immigration laws that impact the availability of labor or tariffs on imported construction materials 

in connection with our renovation redevelopment development and related construction activities we may be unable to obtain or suffer delays in obtaining necessary zoning landuse building occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations or satisfactory tax rates incentives or abatements operators of new facilities we construct may need to obtain medicare and medicaid certification and enter into medicare and medicaid provider agreements andor thirdparty payor contracts in the event that the operator is unable to obtain the necessary licensure certification provider agreements or contracts after the completion of construction there is a risk that we will not be able to earn any revenues on the facility until either the initial operator obtains a license or certification to operate the new facility and the necessary provider agreements or contracts or we find and contract with a new operator that is able to obtain a license to operate the facility for its intended use and the necessary provider agreements or contracts we have experienced such delays in obtaining necessary licensing for constructed properties and may experience additional or more significant delays in the future 

we rely on our development managers general contractors and subcontractors to oversee and manage daytoday construction activities if any such party underperforms we may need to exercise contractual remedies against such party which may include termination of the applicable underlying service contract in the event such termination occurs midconstruction we would likely need to engage a new service provider which would likely result in additional costs and delays as the transition between providers occurs 

the abovedescribed factors could result in increased costs or our abandonment of these projects in addition we may abandon opportunities we have begun to investigate for a range of reasons including changes in expected financing or construction costs adverse changes in expected rents or expenses adverse environmental andor geotechnical findings or conditions to zoning approval which would result in additional expenses beyond those originally expected in addition we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all which may render us unable to proceed with our development activities we may not be able to complete construction and leaseup of a property on budget and on schedule which could result in increased debt service expense or construction costs additionally the time frame required for development 

construction and leaseup of these properties means that we may have to wait years for significant cash returns because we are required to make cash distributions to our stockholders if the cash flow from operations or refinancing is not sufficient we may be forced to borrow additional money to fund such distributions newly developed and acquired properties may not produce the cash flow that we expect which could adversely affect our overall financial performance 

we may experience losses caused by severe weather conditions natural disasters or the physical effects of climate change which could result in an increase of our or our tenants’ cost of insurance unanticipated costs associated with evacuation a decrease in our anticipated revenues or a significant loss of the capital we have invested in a property   

we maintain or require our tenants to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties with terms conditions limits and deductibles that we believe are appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage however a large number of our properties are located in areas particularly susceptible to revenue loss cost increase or damage caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters such as hurricanes earthquakes tornadoes and floods as well as the effects of climate change we believe given current industry practice and analysis prepared by outside consultants that our and our tenants’ insurance coverage is appropriate to cover reasonably anticipated losses that may be caused by hurricanes earthquakes tornadoes floods wildfires and other severe weather conditions and natural disasters including the effects of climate change nevertheless we are always subject to the risk that such insurance will not fully cover all losses and depending on the severity of the event and the impact on our properties such insurance may not cover a significant portion of the losses including but not limited to the costs associated with evacuation these losses may lead to an increase of our and our tenants’ cost of insurance a decrease in our anticipated revenues from an affected property and a loss of all or a portion of the capital we have invested in an affected property in addition we or our tenants may not purchase insurance under certain circumstances if the cost of insurance exceeds in our or our tenants’ judgment the value of the coverage relative to the risk of loss also changes in federal and state legislation and regulation relating to climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency and resiliency of our existing properties and could also necessitate us to spend more on our new development properties without a corresponding increase in revenue 

to the extent that significant changes in the climate occur in areas where our communities are located we may experience extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature all of which may result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions should the impact of climate change be material including significant property damage to or destruction of our communities or occur for lengthy periods of time our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected in addition changes in federal state and local legislation and regulation based on concerns about climate change could result in increased capital expenditures on our existing properties and our new development properties without a corresponding increase in revenue resulting in adverse impacts to our net income 

we may incur costs to remediate environmental contamination at our properties which could have an adverse effect on our or our obligors’ business or financial condition 

under various laws owners or operators of real estate may be required to respond to the presence or release of hazardous substances on the property and may be held liable for property damage personal injuries or penalties that result from environmental contamination or exposure to hazardous substances these laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of the release of the substances or caused the release we may become liable to reimburse the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination generally such liability attaches to a person based on the person’s relationship to the property our tenants or borrowers are primarily responsible for the condition of the property moreover we review environmental site assessments of the properties that we own or encumber prior to taking an interest in them those assessments are designed to meet the “all appropriate inquiry” standard which we believe qualifies us for the innocent purchaser defense if environmental liabilities arise based upon such assessments we do not believe that any of our properties are subject to material environmental contamination however environmental liabilities may be present in our properties and we may incur costs to remediate contamination which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition or the business or financial condition of our obligors   

cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our business and result in the loss of confidential information and legal liability 

our business is at risk from and may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential data through phishing or other malicious activity attempts to interrupt our access to or use of information technology systems through distributed denialofservice or ransomware attacks breaches related to our increased receipt and use of data from multiple sources and other electronic security breaches or other cybersecurity incidents within our environment or our business partners environments including those resulting from human error product defects and technology failures such cyberattacks can range from individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our or our business partners information technology systems to more sophisticated security threats and may be specifically targeted to our business or more general industry wide risks our information technology networks and those of our business partners are essential to our ability to perform daytoday operations of our business while we employ a number of measures to prevent detect and mitigate these threats there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing or detecting a cyberattack even the most wellprotected information networks systems and facilities remain vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted cybersecurity breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target and in some cases are 

designed not to be detected and in fact may not be detected accordingly we may be unable to anticipate these techniques implement adequate cybersecurity barriers or other preventative measures or respond mitigate the risks from and recover from an attack without operational impact and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk we regularly defend against respond to and mitigate risks from cybersecurity breaches which to date have not had a material impact on our operations however there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our or our critical business partners’ business damage our reputation cause us to incur significant remediation expense and have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations cybersecurity breaches that compromise proprietary personal identifying or confidential information of our employees operators tenants and partners or result in operational disruptions could result in legal claims or proceedings including enforcement actions by regulators under data privacy regulations 

evolving privacy regulations could expose our business to reputational harm and losses 

regulatory authorities around the world have implemented or are considering implementing a number of legislative changes or regulations concerning data protection which have required or may require us to incur additional expenses and may expose us to additional risks we are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the protection of personal and confidential information of our clients or employees including us federal and state laws including but not limited to the state of california and non us laws such as the general data protection regulation and the eu general data protection regulation which impose a number of obligations on us these obligations vary from state to state and country to country but generally have accountability and transparency including consent detailed information and data removal and security requirements some jurisdictions impose the same requirements and restrictions on transfers of data from their jurisdictions to jurisdictions that they do not consider adequate this may have implications for our crossborder data flows and may result in additional compliance costs 

many jurisdictions assess fines the magnitude of which may depend on the annual global revenue of the noncompliant company the nature gravity and duration of and the violation additionally in some jurisdictions data subjects may have a right to compensation for financial or nonfinancial losses complying with these laws may cause us to incur substantial operational and compliance costs or require us to change our business practices despite efforts to bring our practices into compliance with these laws we may not be successful either due to internal or external factors such as resource allocation limitations or a lack of cooperation among our business partners noncompliance could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities regulators our business partners residents of our communities data subjects suppliers vendors or other parties further there is a risk that compliance measures we undertake will not be implemented correctly or that individuals within our business or that of our business partners will not be fully compliant with the new procedures if there are breaches of these measures we could face significant administrative and monetary sanctions as well as reputational damage which may have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition and prospects 

our success and the success of our operators and managers depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed 

our success and the success of our operators and managers depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel including executive officers and other highly qualified employees and competition for their talents is intense there is substantial competition for qualified personnel we cannot assure you that we will retain our key personnel or that we will be able to recruit and retain other highly qualified employees in the future losing any key personnel could at least temporarily have a material adverse effect on our business and that of our operators and managers financial position and results of operations   

risks arising from our capital structure   

we may become more leveraged   

permanent financing for our investments is typically provided through a combination of public offerings of debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt the incurrence or assumption of indebtedness may cause us to become more leveraged which could 1 require us to dedicate a greater portion of our cash flow to the payment of debt service 2 make us more vulnerable to a downturn in the economy 3 limit our ability to obtain additional financing 4 negatively affect our credit ratings or outlook by one or more of the rating agencies or 5 make us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates because of the variable interest rates on some of our borrowings to the extent we have not entirely hedged such variable rate debt 

cash available for distributions to stockholders may be insufficient to make dividend contributions at expected levels and are made at the discretion of the board of directors   

if cash available for distribution generated by our assets decreases due to dispositions or otherwise we may be unable to make dividend distributions at expected levels our inability to make expected distributions would likely result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock all distributions are made at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with delaware law and depend on our earnings our financial condition debt and equity capital available to us our expectation of 

our future capital requirements and operating performance restrictive covenants in our financial and other contractual arrangements maintenance of our reit qualification restrictions under delaware law and other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time additionally our ability to make distributions will be adversely affected if any of the risks described herein or other significant adverse events occur   

we are subject to covenants in our debt agreements that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our debt agreements contain various covenants restrictions and events of default among other things these provisions require us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness create liens and make investments or acquisitions breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness in addition to any other indebtedness crossdefaulted against such instruments these defaults could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to make future investments or to meet our obligations and commitments 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the capital necessary to make future investments or to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature our access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control including rising interest rates inflation and other general market conditions the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions the market price of the shares of our common stock and the credit ratings of our debt securities changes in the credit ratings on us government debt securities uncertainty from the expected discontinuance of libor and the transition to any other interest rate benchmark and default or delay in payment by the us of its obligations we also rely on the financial institutions that are parties to our revolving credit facilities if these institutions become capital constrained tighten their lending standards or become insolvent or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from other borrowers within a short period of time they may be unable or unwilling to honor their funding commitments to us which would adversely affect our ability to draw on our revolving credit facilities and over time could negatively impact our ability to consummate acquisitions repay indebtedness as it matures fund capital expenditures or make distributions to our stockholders if our access to capital is limited by these factors or other factors it could negatively impact our ability to acquire properties repay or refinance our indebtedness fund operations or make distributions to our stockholders 

changes affecting the availability of the london interbank offered rate “libor” may have consequences for us that cannot yet reasonably be predicted 

we have outstanding debt hedge agreements and receivable transactions with variable interest rates based on libor the libor benchmark has been subject of national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform in march 2021 ice benchmark administration the administrator of libor confirmed that it would cease publication of usd libor on december 31 2021 for the one week and two month usd libor tenors and on june 30 2023 for all other usd libor tenors as a result the united states federal reserve has advised banks to stop new usd libor issuances by the end of 2021 the alternative reference rates committee which was convened by the federal reserve board and the new york fed has identified the second oversight financing rate sofr as the recommended alternative rate for libor while it is not currently possible to determine precisely whether or to what extent the withdrawal and replacement of libor would affect us the implementation of sofr or other alternative benchmark rates to libor may have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition any new benchmark rate will likely not replicate libor exactly which could impact contracts that terminate after 2023 there is uncertainty about how applicable law the courts or we will address the replacement of libor with alternative rates on agreements that do not include alternative rate fallback provisions in addition any changes to benchmark rates may have an uncertain impact on our cost of funds and our access to the capital markets which could impact our results of operations and cash flows uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes may also adversely affect the trading market for our securities additional financing therefore may be unavailable more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness 

downgrades in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our cost and availability of capital 

we plan to manage the company to maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile but there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the rating agencies could have a material adverse effect on our cost and availability of capital which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity cash flows the tradingredemption price of our securities and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to our equity holders 

increases in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our cost of capital 

an increase in interest rates may increase interest cost on new and existing variable rate debt such increases in the cost of capital could adversely impact our ability to finance operations acquire and develop properties and refinance existing debt additionally increased interest rates may also result in less liquid property markets limiting our ability to sell existing assets 

risks arising from our status as a reit   

we might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a reit   

we intend to operate as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” and believe we have operated and will continue to operate in such a manner if we lose our status as a reit we will face serious income tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for satisfying our obligations and for distribution to our stockholders because 

• we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rates 

• we would be subject to increased state and local taxes and 

• unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions we could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified 

since reit qualification requires us to meet a number of complex requirements it is possible that we may fail to fulfill them and if we do our earnings will be reduced by the amount of us federal and other income taxes owed a reduction in our earnings would affect the amount we could distribute to our stockholders if we do not qualify as a reit we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders since a nonreit is not required to pay dividends to stockholders in order to maintain reit status or avoid an excise tax in addition if we fail to qualify as a reit all distributions to stockholders will continue to be treated as dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits although corporate stockholders may be eligible for the dividends received deduction and individual stockholders may be eligible for taxation at the rates generally applicable to longterm capital gains with respect to distributions 

as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to implement our business strategy and would adversely affect the value of our common stock qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to remain qualified as a reit although we believe that we qualify as a reit we cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as a reit for us federal income tax purposes 

certain subsidiaries might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

we own interests in a number of entities which have elected to be taxed as reits for us federal income tax purposes some of which we consolidate for financial reporting purposes but each of which is treated as a separate reit for federal income tax purposes each a “subsidiary reit” to qualify as a reit each subsidiary reit must independently satisfy all of the reit qualification requirements under the code together with all other rules applicable to reits provided that each subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit our interests in the subsidiary reits will be treated as qualifying real estate assets for purposes of the reit asset tests if a subsidiary reit fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year such subsidiary reit will be subject to federal and state income taxes and may not be able to qualify as a reit for the four subsequent taxable years any such failure could have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reit income and asset tests and thus our ability to qualify as a reit unless we are able to avail ourselves of certain relief provisions   

the 90 annual distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions   

to comply with the 90 distribution requirement applicable to reits and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax we must make distributions to our stockholders although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the reit distribution requirement it is possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90 distribution requirement this may be due to timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses on the one hand and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income on the other hand in addition nondeductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of noncash deductions may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90 distribution requirement in the event that timing differences occur or we deem it appropriate to retain cash we may borrow funds even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings issue additional equity securities although we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so pay taxable stock dividends if possible distribute other property or securities or engage in other transactions intended to enable us to meet the reit distribution requirements this may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations   

our use of trss is limited under the code 

under the code no more than 20 of the value of the gross assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss this limitation may affect our ability to increase the size of our trss’ operations and assets and there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the applicable limitation or that such compliance will not adversely affect our business also our trss may not among other things operate or manage certain health care facilities which may cause us to forgo investments we might otherwise make finally we may be subject to a 100 excise tax on the income derived from certain transactions with our trss that are not on an armslength basis we believe our arrangements with our trss are on 

armslength terms and intend to continue to operate in a manner that allows us to avoid incurring the 100 excise tax described above but there can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid application of that tax 

the lease of qualified health care properties to a taxable reit subsidiary is subject to special requirements 

we lease certain qualified health care properties to taxable reit subsidiaries or limited liability companies of which the taxable reit subsidiaries are members which lessees contract with managers or related parties to manage the health care operations at these properties the rents from this taxable reit subsidiary lessee structure are treated as qualifying rents from real property if 1 they are paid pursuant to an armslength lease of a qualified health care property with a taxable reit subsidiary and 2 the manager qualifies as an eligible independent contractor as defined in the code if any of these conditions are not satisfied then the rents will not be qualifying rents 

if certain saleleaseback transactions are not characterized by the internal revenue service “irs” as “true leases” we may be subject to adverse tax consequences   

we have purchased certain properties and leased them back to the sellers of such properties and we may enter into similar transactions in the future we intend for any such saleleaseback transaction to be structured in such a manner that the lease will be characterized as a “true lease” thereby allowing us to be treated as the owner of the property for us federal income tax purposes however depending on the terms of any specific transaction the irs might take the position that the transaction is not a “true lease” but is more properly treated in some other manner in the event any saleleaseback transaction is challenged and successfully recharacterized by the irs we would not be entitled to claim the deductions for depreciation and cost recovery generally available to an owner of property furthermore if a saleleaseback transaction were so recharacterized we might fail to satisfy the reit asset tests or income tests and consequently could lose our reit status effective with the year of recharacterization alternatively the amount of our reit taxable income could be recalculated which may cause us to fail to meet the reit annual distribution requirements for a taxable year 

we could be subject to changes in our tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to taxes in the us and foreign jurisdictions because the us maintains a worldwide corporate tax system the foreign and us tax systems are somewhat interdependent longstanding international norms that determine each countrys jurisdiction to tax crossborder international trade are evolving and could reduce the ability of our foreign subsidiaries to deduct for foreign tax purposes the interest they pay on loans from us thereby increasing the foreign tax liability of the subsidiaries it is also possible that foreign countries could increase their withholding taxes on dividends and interest 

our effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates or changes in tax laws or their interpretation we are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the irs and other tax authorities and governmental bodies we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations if we were subject to review or examination by the irs or applicable foreign jurisdiction as the result of any new tax law changes the ultimate determination of which may change our taxes owed for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued or recorded our financial condition operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected 

the present federal income tax treatment of reits may be modified possibly with retroactive effect by legislative judicial or administrative action at any time which could affect the federal income tax treatment of an investment in us the federal income tax rules dealing with us federal income taxation and reits are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process the irs and the us treasury department which results in statutory changes as well as frequent revisions to regulations and interpretations 

we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws in the us or foreign jurisdictions might affect our investors or us revisions in tax laws and interpretations thereof could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a reit as well as the tax considerations relevant to an investment in us could cause us to change our investments and commitments and adversely affect our earnings and cash flow

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various market risks including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we seek to mitigate the underlying foreign currency exposures with gains and losses on derivative contracts hedging these exposures we seek to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates by matching the terms of new investments with new longterm fixed rate borrowings to the extent possible we may or may not elect to use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate exposure these decisions are principally based on our policy to match our variable rate investments with comparable borrowings but are also based on the general trend in interest rates at the applicable dates and our perception of the future volatility of interest rates this section is presented to provide a discussion of the risks associated with potential fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates for more information see notes 12 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements 

we historically borrow on our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program to acquire construct or make loans relating to health care and seniors housing properties then as market conditions dictate we will issue equity or longterm fixed rate debt to repay the borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program we are subject to risks associated with debt financing including the risk that existing indebtedness may not be refinanced or that the terms of refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of current indebtedness the majority of our borrowings were completed under indentures or contractual agreements that limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur accordingly in the event that we are unable to raise additional equity or borrow money because of these limitations our ability to acquire additional properties may be limited 

a change in interest rates will not affect the interest expense associated with our fixed rate debt interest rate changes however will affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt changes in the interest rate environment upon maturity of this fixed rate debt could have an effect on our future cash flows and earnings depending on whether the debt is replaced with other fixed rate debt variable rate debt or equity or repaid by the sale of assets to illustrate the impact of changes in the interest rate markets we performed a sensitivity analysis on our fixed rate debt instruments whereby we modeled the change in net present values arising from a hypothetical 1 increase in interest rates to determine the instruments’ change in fair value the following table summarizes the analysis performed as of the dates indicated in thousands 



our variable rate debt including our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program is reflected at fair value at december 31 2021 we had 1742268000 outstanding related to our variable rate debt assuming no changes in outstanding balances a 1 increase in interest rates would result in increased annual interest expense of 17423000 at december 31 2020 we had 2241909000 outstanding under our variable rate debt assuming no changes in outstanding balances a 1 increase in interest rates would have resulted in increased annual interest expense of 22420000 

we are subject to currency fluctuations that may from time to time affect our financial condition and results of operations increases or decreases in the value of the canadian dollar or british pounds sterling relative to the us dollar impact the amount of net income we earn from our investments in canada and the united kingdom based solely on our results for the year ended december 31 2021 including the impact of existing hedging arrangements if these exchange rates were to increase or decrease by 10 our net income from these investments would increase or decrease as applicable by less than 11000000 we will continue to mitigate these underlying foreign currency exposures with nonus denominated borrowings and gains and losses on derivative contracts if we increase our international presence through investments in or acquisitions or development of seniors housing and health care properties outside the us we may also decide to transact additional business or borrow funds in currencies other than us dollars canadian dollars or british pounds sterling to illustrate the impact of changes in foreign currency markets we performed a sensitivity analysis on our derivative portfolio whereby we modeled the change in net present values arising from a hypothetical 1 increase in foreign currency exchange rates to determine the instruments’ change in fair value the following table summarizes the results of the analysis performed dollars in thousands

investments 

providing highquality and affordable health care to an aging global population requires vast investments and infrastructure development we invest in seniors housing and health care real estate primarily through acquisitions developments and joint venture partnerships for additional information regarding acquisition and development activity please see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements our portfolio creates opportunities to connect partners across the continuum of care and drive efficiency we seek to diversify our investment portfolio by property type relationship and geographic location in determining whether to invest in a property we focus on the following 1 the experience of the obligor’spartner’s management team 2 the historical and projected financial and operational performance of the property 3 the credit of the obligorpartner 4 the security for any lease or loan 5 the real estate attributes of the building and its location 6 the capital committed to the property by the obligorpartner and 7 the operating fundamentals of the applicable industry 

we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property our asset management process for seniors housing properties generally includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each property review of obligorpartner creditworthiness property inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure real estate taxes letters of credit and other collateral our internal property management division manages and monitors the outpatient medical portfolio with a comprehensive process including review of among other things tenant relations lease expirations the mix of health service providers hospitalhealth system relationships property performance capital improvement needs and market conditions 

investment types   

real property our properties are primarily comprised of land buildings improvements and related rights our triplenet properties are generally leased to operators under longterm operating leases the leases generally have a fixed contractual term of 12 to 15 years and contain one or more five to 15year renewal options certain of our leases also contain purchase options a portion of which could result in the disposition of properties for less than full market value if the options were to be exercised most of our rents are received under triplenet leases requiring the operator to pay rent and all additional charges incurred in the operation of the leased property the tenants are required to repair rebuild and maintain the leased properties substantially all these operating leases are designed with escalating rent structures leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straightline basis over the initial lease period subject to a collectability assessment rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period 

at december 31 2020 approximately 95 of our triplenet properties were subject to master leases a master lease is a lease of multiple properties to one tenant entity under a single lease agreement from time to time we may acquire additional properties that are then leased to the tenant under the master lease the tenant is required to make one monthly payment that represents rent on all the properties that are subject to the master lease typically the master lease tenant can exercise its right to purchase the properties or to renew the master lease only with respect to all leased properties at the same time we believe this bundling feature benefits us because the tenant cannot limit the purchase or renewal to better performing properties and terminate the leasing arrangement with respect to poorer performing properties this spreads our risk among the entire group of properties within the master lease the bundling feature should provide a similar advantage to us if the master lease tenant is in bankruptcy subject to certain restrictions a debtor in bankruptcy has the right to assume or reject its unexpired leases and executory contracts in the context of integrated master leases such as ours our tenants in bankruptcy would be required to assume or reject the master lease as a whole rather than deciding on a property by property basis 

our outpatient medical portfolio is primarily selfmanaged and consists principally of multitenant properties leased to health care providers our leases typically include increasers and some form of operating expense reimbursement by the tenant as of december 31 2020 77 of our portfolio included leases with full pass through 20 with a partial expense reimbursement modified gross and 3 with no expense reimbursement gross our outpatient medical leases are noncancellable operating leases that have a weightedaverage remaining term of six years at december 31 2020 and are often credit enhanced by security deposits guarantees andor letters of credit 

construction we provide for the construction of properties for tenants primarily as part of longterm operating leases we capitalize certain interest costs associated with funds used for the construction of properties owned by us the amount capitalized is based upon the amount advanced during the construction period using the rate of interest that approximates our companywide cost of financing our interest expense is reduced by the amount capitalized the construction period commences upon funding and terminates upon the earlier of the completion of the applicable property or the end of a specified period during the construction period we advance funds to the tenants in accordance with agreed upon terms and conditions which require among other things periodic site visits by a company representative during the construction period we generally require an additional credit enhancement in the form of payment and performance bonds andor completion guarantees at december 31 2020 we had outstanding construction investments of 487742000 and were committed to provide additional funds of approximately 622108000 to complete construction for investment properties we also provide for construction loans which depending on the terms and conditions could be treated as loans real property or investments in unconsolidated entities 

loans our real estate loans are typically structured to provide us with interest income principal amortization and transaction fees real estate loans consist of mortgage loans and other real estate loans which are primarily collateralized by a first second or third mortgage lien a leasehold mortgage on or an assignment of the partnership interest in the related properties corporate guarantees andor personal guarantees nonreal estate loans are generally corporate loans with no real estate backing at december 31 2020 we had outstanding loans net of allowances of 683641000 with an interest yield of approximately 77 per annum our yield on loans depends upon a number of factors including the stated interest rate average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments the loans outstanding at december 31 2020 are generally subject to one to 15year terms with principal amortization schedules andor balloon payments of the outstanding principal balances at the end of the term 

investments in unconsolidated entities investments in entities that we do not consolidate but for which we can exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are reported under the equity method of accounting our investments in unconsolidated entities generally represent interests ranging from 10 to 65 in real estate assets under the equity method of accounting our share of the investee’s earnings or losses is included in our consolidated results of operations the initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated entities is based on the amount paid to purchase the entity interest inclusive of transaction costs we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the equity method investment to its carrying value when we determine a decline in the estimated fair value of such an investment below its carrying value is otherthantemporary an impairment is recorded 

in substance real estate additionally we provide loans to third parties for the acquisition development and construction of real estate under these arrangements it is possible that we will participate in the expected residual profits of the project through the sale refinancing or acquisition of the property we evaluate the characteristics of each arrangement including its risks and rewards to determine whether they are more similar to those associated with a loan or an investment in real estate arrangements with characteristics implying real estate joint ventures are treated as in substance real estate investments accounted for using the equity method and are presented as investments in unconsolidated entities we have made loans totaling 333934000 related to eight properties as of december 31 2020 which are classified as in substance real estate investments 

principles of consolidation 

the consolidated financial statements are in conformity with us general accepted accounting principles “us gaap” and include the accounts of our whollyowned subsidiaries and joint venture entities that we control through voting rights or other means all material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation 

at inception of joint venture transactions we identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights “variable interest entities” or “vies” and determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of its operations a vie is broadly defined as an entity where either i the equity investors as a group if any do not have a controlling financial interest or ii the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support we consolidate investments in vies when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary accounting standards codification topic 810 consolidations requires enterprises to perform a qualitative approach to determining whether or not a vie will need to be consolidated this evaluation is based on an enterprise’s ability to direct and influence the activities of a vie that most significantly impact that entity’s economic performance 

for investments in joint ventures us gaap may preclude consolidation by the sole general partner in certain circumstances based on the type of rights held by the limited partners we assess the limited partners’ rights and their impact on our consolidation conclusions and we reassess if there is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights of the limited partners the sole general partner increases or decreases its ownership of limited partnership interests or there is an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding limited partnership interests we similarly evaluate the rights of managing members of limited liability companies 

borrowing policies 

we utilize a combination of debt and equity to fund investments generally we intend to issue unsecured fixedrate public debt with longterm maturities to approximate the maturities on our triplenet leases and investment strategy for shortterm purposes we may borrow on our primary unsecured credit facility or issue commercial paper we replace these borrowings with longterm capital such as senior unsecured notes or common stock when terms are deemed favorable we may invest in properties subject to existing mortgage indebtedness in addition we may obtain secured financing for unleveraged properties in which we have invested or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis in certain agreements with our lenders we are subject to restrictions with respect to secured and unsecured indebtedness 

competition 

we compete with other real estate investment trusts real estate partnerships private equity and hedge fund investors banks insurance companies financeinvestment companies governmentsponsored agencies taxable and taxexempt bond funds health care operators developers and other investors in the acquisition development leasing and financing of health care and seniors housing properties we compete for investments based on a number of factors including relationships certainty of execution investment structures and underwriting criteria our ability to successfully compete is impacted by economic and demographic trends availability of acceptable investment opportunities our ability to negotiate beneficial investment terms availability and cost of capital construction and renovation costs and applicable laws and regulations 

the operatorstenants of our properties compete with properties that provide comparable services in the local markets operatorstenants compete for patients and residents based on a number of factors including quality of care reputation physical appearance of properties location services offered family preferences including a preference for home health services instead of residing in one of our communities physicians staff and price throughout the covid19 pandemic seniors housing operators have experienced broadbased occupancy declines and as a result we expect competition to increase in 2021 and beyond as operators attempt to fill unoccupied units we also face competition from other health care facilities for tenants such as physicians and other health care providers that provide comparable facilities and services

certain government regulations 

united states 

health law matters — generally 

typically operators of seniors housing facilities do not receive significant funding from government programs and are largely subject to state laws as opposed to federal laws operators of longtermpostacute care facilities and hospitals do receive significant funding from government programs and these facilities are subject to extensive regulation including federal and state laws covering the type and quality of medical andor nursing care provided ancillary services  eg  respiratory occupational physical and infusion therapies qualifications of the administrative personnel and nursing staff the adequacy of the physical plant and equipment reimbursement and rate setting and operating policies in addition as described below operators of these facilities are subject to extensive laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including but not limited to the federal antikickback statute “aks” the federal stark law “stark law” and the federal false claims act “fca” as well as comparable state laws hospitals physician group practice clinics and other health care providers that operate in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal state and local licensure registration certification and inspection laws regulations and industry standards as well as other conditions of participation in federal and state government programs such as medicare and medicaid further operators of longterm care facilities are required to have in place compliance and ethics programs that meet the requirements of federal laws and regulations our tenants’ failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in among other things loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension decertification or exclusion from federal and state health care programs loss of license or closure of the facility see risk factors “the requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid could have a material adverse effect on our obligors’ liquidity financial condition and results of operations which could adversely affect our obligors’ ability to meet their obligations to us” and “our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with federal state local and industryregulated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards could adversely affect such operators’ or tenants’ operations which could adversely affect our operators’ and tenants’ ability to meet their obligations to us” in “item 1a – risk factors” below moreover in light of certain arrangements that welltower may pursue with healthcare entities who are directly subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse and given that certain of our arrangements are structured under the provisions of the reit investment diversification and empowerment act of 2007 ridea certain health care fraud and abuse laws and data privacy laws could apply directly to welltower see risk factor we assume operational and legal risks with respect to our properties managed in ridea structures that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in item 1a  risk factors below 

licensing and certification 

the primary regulations that affect longterm and postacute care facilities are state licensing and registration laws for example certain health care facilities are subject to a variety of licensure and certificate of need “con” laws and regulations where applicable con laws generally require among other requirements that a facility demonstrate the need for 1 constructing a new facility 2 adding beds or expanding an existing facility 3 investing in major capital equipment or adding new services 4 changing the ownership or control of an existing licensed facility or 5 terminating services that have been previously approved through the con process certain state con laws and regulations may restrict the ability of operators to add new properties or expand an existing facility’s size or services in addition con laws may constrain the ability of an operator to transfer responsibility for operating a particular facility to a new operator 

with respect to licensure generally our longtermpostacute care facilities are required to be licensed and certified for participation in medicare medicaid and other federal and state health care programs the failure of our operators to maintain or renew any required license or regulatory approval as well as the failure of our operators to correct serious deficiencies identified in a compliance survey could require those operators to discontinue operations at a property in addition if a property is found to be out of compliance with medicare medicaid or other federal or state health care program conditions of participation the property operator may be excluded from participating in those government health care programs 

reimbursement 

the reimbursement methodologies applied to health care facilities continue to evolve federal and state authorities have considered and implemented and may continue seeking to implement new or modified reimbursement methodologies including valuebased reimbursement methodologies that may negatively impact health care property operations likewise thirdparty payors may continue imposing greater controls on operators including through changes in reimbursement rates and fee structures the impact of any such changes if implemented may result in a material adverse effect on our portfolio no assurance can be given that current revenue sources or levels will be maintained accordingly there can be no assurance that payments under a government health care program are currently or will be in the future sufficient to fully reimburse the property operators for their operating and capital expenses 

• seniors housing facilities the majority of the revenues received by the operators of us seniors housing facilities are from private pay sources the remaining revenue source is primarily medicaid provided under state waiver programs for home and communitybased care there can be no guarantee that a state medicaid program operating pursuant to a waiver will be able to maintain its waiver status rates paid by selfpay residents are set by the facilities and are determined by local market conditions and operating costs generally facilities receive a higher payment per day for a private pay resident than for a medicaid beneficiary who requires a comparable level of care the level of medicaid reimbursement varies from state to state thus the revenues generated by operators of our assisted living facilities may be adversely affected by payor mix acuity level changes in medicaid eligibility and reimbursement levels 

• longtermpostacute care facilities   the majority of the revenues received by the operators of these facilities are from the medicare and medicaid programs with the balance representing reimbursement payments from private payors and patients consequently changes in federal or state reimbursement policies may adversely affect an operator’s ability to cover its expenses including our rent or debt service longtermpostacute care facilities are subject to periodic pre and postpayment reviews and other audits by federal and state authorities a review or audit of a property operator’s claims could result in recoupments denials or delay of payments in the future due to the significant judgments and estimates inherent in payor settlement accounting no assurance can be given as to the adequacy of any reserves maintained by our property operators to cover potential adjustments to reimbursements or to cover settlements made to payors 

◦ medicare reimbursement generally longtermpostacute care facilities are reimbursed by medicare under prospective payment systems which generally provide reimbursement based upon a predetermined fixed amount per episode of care and are updated by cms an agency of the department of health and human services “hhs” annually there is a risk under these payment systems that costs will exceed the fixed payments or that payments may be set below the costs to provide certain items and services further there is risk that medicare skilled nursing facility snf payment reforms may impact our tenants and operators in addition the hhs office of inspector general has released recommendations to address snf billing practices and medicare payment rates if followed these recommendations regarding snf payment reform may impact our tenants and operators 

◦ medicaid reimbursement   many states reimburse snfs using fixed daily rates which are applied prospectively based on patient acuity and the historical costs incurred in providing patient care in most states medicaid does not fully reimburse the cost of providing services certain states are attempting to slow the rate of medicaid growth by freezing rates or restricting eligibility and benefits in addition medicaid reimbursement rates may decline if state revenues in a particular state are not sufficient to fund budgeted expenditures 

• medicare reimbursement for physicians hospital outpatient departments “hopds” and ambulatory surgical centers “ascs” changes in reimbursement to physicians hopds and ascs may further affect our tenants and operators generally medicare reimburses physicians under the physician fee schedule while hopds and ascs are reimbursed under prospective payment systems the physician fee schedule and the hopd and asc prospective payment systems are updated annually by cms these annual medicare payment regulations have resulted in lower net pay increases than providers of those services have often expected in addition the medicare and children’s health insurance program reauthorization act of 2015 “macra” includes payment reductions for providers who do not meet government quality standards the implementation of payforquality models like those required under macra has the potential to produce funding disparities that could adversely impact some provider tenants in outpatient medical buildings and other health care properties changes in medicare advantage plan payments may also indirectly affect our operators and tenants that contract with medicare advantage plans 

• health reform laws the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the “health reform laws” dramatically altered how health care is delivered and reimbursed in 

the us and contained various provisions including medicaid expansion and the establishment of health insurance exchanges “hies” providing subsidized health insurance that may directly impact us or the operators and tenants of our properties the status of the health reform laws may be subject to change as a result of political legislative regulatory and administrative developments and judicial proceedings while legislative attempts to completely repeal the health reform laws have been unsuccessful to date there have been multiple attempts to repeal or amend the health reform laws through legislative action and legal challenges during the trump administration the former president and us congress sought to modify repeal or otherwise invalidate all or portions of the health reform laws for example in december 2017 the us congress passed the tax cuts and jobs act which included a provision that eliminates the penalty under the health reform laws’ individual mandate effective in 2019 and could impact the future state of the hies established by the health reform laws in december 2018 a federal district court in texas ruled the individual mandate was unconstitutional and could not be severed from the health reform laws as a result the court ruled the remaining provisions of the health reform laws were also invalid though the court declined to issue a preliminary injunction with respect to the health reform laws in december 2019 the fifth circuit court of appeals agreed that the individual mandate was unconstitutional but remanded the case back to the district court to reassess how much of the health reform laws would be damaged without the individual mandate provision and if the individual mandate could indeed be severed the fifth circuits decision was appealed to the supreme court of the united states which granted certiorari on these issues and conducted an oral argument in november 2020 this litigation is still ongoing but places great uncertainty upon the longevity and nature of the health reform laws moving forward there is also uncertainty with respect to the impact the biden administration and the new us congress may have on health reform including through new legislative executive order or regulatory efforts and any changes will likely take time to unfold and could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for health care items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the health reform laws we cannot predict whether the existing health reform laws or future health care reform legislation executive order or regulatory changes will have a material impact on our operators’ or tenants’ property or business 

fraud  abuse enforcement 

longtermpostacute care facilities and seniors housing facilities that receive medicaid payments are subject to federal state and local laws regulations and applicable guidance that govern the operations and financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by health care providers certain of these laws such as the aks and stark law prohibit direct or indirect payments of any kind for the purpose of inducing or encouraging the referral of patients for medical products or services reimbursable by government health care programs other government health program laws require providers to furnish only medically necessary services and submit to the government valid and accurate statements for each service our operators and tenants that receive payments from federal health care programs such as medicare and medicaid are subject to substantial financial penalties under the civil monetary penalties act and the fca upon a finding of noncompliance with such laws in addition states may also have separate false claims acts which among other things generally prohibit health care providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payments federal and state fcas contain whistleblower provisions that permit private individuals to bring health care fraud enforcement claims on behalf of the government still other laws require providers to comply with a variety of safety health and other requirements relating to the condition of the licensed property and the quality of care provided sanctions for violations of these laws regulations and other applicable guidance may include but are not limited to criminal andor civil penalties and fines loss of licensure immediate termination of government payments exclusion from any government health care program damage assessments and imprisonment in certain circumstances violation of these rules such as those prohibiting abusive and fraudulent behavior with respect to one property may subject other facilities under common control or ownership to sanctions including exclusion from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs as well as other government health care programs in the ordinary course of its business a property operator is regularly subjected to inquiries investigations and audits by the federal and state agencies that oversee these laws and regulations 

prosecutions investigations or whistleblower actions could have a material adverse effect on a property operator’s liquidity financial condition and operations which could adversely affect the ability of the operator to meet its financial obligations to us in addition government investigations and enforcement actions brought against the health care industry have increased dramatically over the past several years and are expected to continue the costs for an operator of a health care property associated with both defending such enforcement actions and the undertakings in settling these actions can be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its obligations to us in addition welltower could potentially be directly subject to these health care fraud and abuse laws as well as potential investigation or enforcement as a result of our rideastructured arrangements and certain collaboration or other arrangements we may pursue with stakeholders who are directly subject to these laws 

federal and state data privacy and security laws 

the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” as amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act and numerous other state and federal laws govern the collection security dissemination use access to and confidentiality of personal information including individually identifiable health 

information violations of these laws may result in substantial civil andor criminal fines and penalties the costs to a business such as ours or to an operator of a health care property associated with developing and maintaining programs and systems to comply with data privacy and security laws defending against privacy and security related claims or enforcement actions and paying any assessed fines can be substantial moreover such costs could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its obligations to us finally data privacy and security laws and regulations continue to develop including with regard to hipaa and us state privacy laws such as the california consumer privacy act and the new california privacy rights act that will go into effect in 2023 as we use data to better inform our investments and the efficacy of care in our communities these developments may add potential uncertainty towards compliance obligations business operations or transactions that depend on data these new privacy laws may create restrictions or requirements in our our operators and other business partners use sharing and securing of data new privacy and security laws could require substantial investment in resources to comply with regulatory changes as privacy and security laws proliferate in divergent ways or impose additional obligations 

united kingdom 

in the uk care home services are principally regulated by the health and social care act 2008 as amended and other regulations this legislation subjects service providers to a number of legally binding “fundamental standards” and requires amongst other things that all persons carrying out “regulated activities” in the uk and the managers of such persons be registered providers of care home services are also subject as data controllers to laws governing their use of personal data including in relation to their employees clients and recipients of their services these laws currently take the form of the uk’s data protection act 2018 and the uk general data protection regulation collectively “uk dp laws” uk dp laws impose a significant number of obligations on controllers with the potential for fines of up to 4 of annual worldwide turnover or €1750 million whichever is greater entities incorporated in or carrying on a business in the uk as well as individuals residing in the uk are also subject to the uk bribery act 2010 the uk has national minimum wage legislation with a maximum fine for nonpayment of £20000 per worker and employers who fail to pay will be banned from being a company director for up to 15 years in addition there is a bill currently going through the uk parliament which will require a care home provider where entering into a contract for the provision of healthcare or social care services with a local public authority to enter into mandatory contractual terms to provide the local public authority with evidence that it pays the national minimum wage to all of its employees engaged in the provision of services for which the provider has contracted for eg a national minimum wage record further the working time and holiday pay bill 20192021 is currently going through the uk parliament which makes provision for the expiration of the working time regulations 1998 provides for additional regulations governing working time and makes provisions for holiday pay for employees

canada 

senior living residences in canada are provincially regulated within each province there are different categories for senior living residences that are generally based on the level of care sought andor required by a resident eg assisted or retirement living senior living residences residential care longterm care in some of these categories and depending on the province residences may be government funded or the individual residents may be eligible for a government subsidy while other residences are exclusively privatepay the governing legislation and regulations vary by province but generally the object of the laws is to set licensing requirements and minimum standards for senior living residences and regulate operations these laws empower regulators in each province to take a variety of steps to ensure compliance conduct inspections issue reports and generally regulate the industry 

our operations in canada are subject to privacy legislation including in certain provinces privacy laws specifically related to personal health information although the obligations of senior living residences in the various provinces differ they all include the obligation to protect personal information under some of these laws notification to the regulator in the event of an actual or suspected privacy breach is mandatory the powers of privacy regulators and penalties for violations of privacy law vary according to the applicable law or are left to the courts senior living residences may also be subject to laws pertaining to residential tenancy provincial andor municipal laws applicable to fire safety food services zoning occupational health and safety public health and the provision of community health care and funded longtermpostacute care

• we will be subject to a 100 tax on certain amounts from certain transactions involving our “taxable reit subsidiaries” that are not conducted on an arm’s length basis see “qualification as a reit  investments in taxable reit subsidiaries 

if we acquire any assets from a corporation which is or has been a “c” corporation in a carryover basis transaction including where a “c” corporation elects reit status we could be liable for specified liabilities that are inherited from the “c” corporation a “c” corporation is generally defined as a corporation that is required to pay full corporate level us federal income tax if we recognize gain on the disposition of the assets during the fiveyear period beginning on the date on which the assets were acquired by us then to the extent of the assets’ “builtin gain” eg the excess of the fair market value of the asset over the adjusted tax basis of the asset in each case determined as of the beginning of the fiveyear period we will be subject to tax on the gain at the highest regular corporate rate applicable the results described in this paragraph with respect to the recognition of builtin gain assume that the “c” corporation did not make and was not treated as making an election to treat the builtin gain assets as sold to an unrelated party for those properties that are subject to the builtin gains tax the potential 

amount of builtin gains tax will be an additional factor when considering a possible sale of the properties within the fiveyear period beginning on the date on which the properties were acquired by us see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the builtin gains tax 

qualification as a reit 

a reit is defined as a corporation trust or association 

1 which is managed by one or more trustees or directors 

2 the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest 

3 which would be taxable as a domestic corporation but for the us federal income tax law relating to reits 

4 which is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company 

5 the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons in each taxable year of the reit except for its first taxable year 

6 not more than 50 in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned during the last half of each taxable year excluding its first taxable year directly indirectly or constructively by or for five or fewer individuals which includes certain entities the five or fewer requirement and 

7 which meets certain income and asset tests described below 

conditions 1 to 4 inclusive must be met during the entire taxable year and condition 5 must be met during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months for purposes of conditions 5 and 6 pension funds and certain other taxexempt entities are treated as individuals subject to a “lookthrough” exception in the case of condition 6 

based on publicly available information we believe we have satisfied the share ownership requirements set forth in 5 and 6 above in addition article vi of our bylaws provides for restrictions regarding ownership and transfer of shares these restrictions are intended to assist us in continuing to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in 5 and 6 above but may not ensure that we will in all cases be able to satisfy such requirements 

we have complied with and will continue to comply with regulatory rules to send annual letters to certain of our stockholders requesting information regarding the actual ownership of our stock if despite sending the annual letters we do not know or after exercising reasonable diligence would not have known whether we failed to meet the five or fewer requirement we will be treated as having met the five or fewer requirement if we fail to comply with these regulatory rules we will be subject to a monetary penalty if our failure to comply were due to intentional disregard of the requirement the penalty would be increased however if our failure to comply were due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect no penalty would be imposed 

we may own a number of properties through wholly owned subsidiaries a corporation will qualify as a “qualified reit subsidiary” if 100 of its stock is owned by a reit and the reit does not elect to treat the subsidiary as a taxable reit subsidiary a “qualified reit subsidiary” will not be treated as a separate corporation for us federal income tax purposes and all assets liabilities and items of income deductions and credits of a “qualified reit subsidiary” will be treated as assets liabilities and items as the case may be of the reit for us federal income tax purposes a “qualified reit subsidiary” is not subject to us federal income tax and our ownership of the voting stock of a qualified reit subsidiary will not violate the restrictions against ownership of securities of any one issuer which constitute more than 10 of the value or total voting power of such issuer or more than 5 of the value of our total assets as described below under “ asset tests” 

if we invest in an entity treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes we will be deemed to own a proportionate share of the entity’s assets likewise we will be treated as receiving our share of the income and loss of the entity and the gross income will retain the same character in our hands as it has in the hands of the entity these “lookthrough” rules apply for purposes of the income tests and assets tests described below 

the deduction of business interest is limited to 30 50 in the case of taxable years beginning in 2019 or 2020 of adjusted taxable income which may limit the deductibility of interest expense by us our taxable reit subsidiaries or our joint venture and partnership arrangements a “real property trade or business” may irrevocably elect out of the applicability of the limitation but if it does so it must use the less favorable alternative depreciation system to depreciate real property used in the trade or business regulations provide guidance on how to allocate interest deductions among multiple trades or businesses and contain special rules including a safe harbor regarding the allocation of a reit’s interest deductions to a “real property trade or business” 

income tests there are two separate percentage tests relating to our sources of gross income that we must satisfy each taxable year 

• at least 75 of our gross income excluding gross income from certain sales of property held primarily for sale generally must be directly or indirectly derived each taxable year from “rents from real property” other income from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property or certain income from qualified temporary investments 

• at least 95 of our gross income excluding gross income from certain sales of property held primarily for sale generally must be directly or indirectly derived each taxable year from any of the sources qualifying for the 75 gross income test and from dividends including dividends from taxable reit subsidiaries and interest 

income from hedging and foreign currency transactions is excluded from the 95 and 75 gross income tests if certain requirements are met but otherwise will constitute gross income which does not qualify under the 95 or 75 gross income tests 

rents received by us will qualify as “rents from real property” for purposes of satisfying the gross income tests for a reit only if several conditions are met 

• the amount of rent must not be based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person although rents generally will not be excluded merely because they are based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales 

• rents received from a tenant will not qualify as rents from real property if the reit or an owner of 10 or more of the reit also directly or constructively owns 10 or more of the tenant unless the tenant is our taxable reit subsidiary and certain other requirements are met with respect to the real property being rented 

• if rent attributable to personal property leased in connection with a lease of real property is greater than 15 of the total rent received under the lease then the portion of rent attributable to such personal property will not qualify as “rents from real property” 

• for rents to qualify as rents from real property we generally must not furnish or render services to tenants other than through a taxable reit subsidiary or an “independent contractor” from whom we derive no income except that we may directly provide services that are usually or customarily rendered in the geographic area in which the property is located in connection with the rental of real property for occupancy only or are not otherwise considered rendered to the occupant for his convenience 

• we may lease “qualified health care properties” on an arm’slength basis to a taxable reit subsidiary if the property is operated on behalf of such subsidiary by a person who qualifies as an “independent contractor” and who is or is related to a person who is actively engaged in the trade or business of operating health care facilities for any person unrelated to us or our taxable reit subsidiary such person an “eligible independent contractor” if this is the case the rent that the reit receives from the taxable reit subsidiary generally will be treated as “rents from real property” a “qualified health care property” includes any real property and any personal property that is or is necessary or incidental to the use of a hospital nursing facility assisted living facility congregate care facility qualified continuing care facility or other licensed facility that extends medical or nursing or ancillary services to patients and is operated by a provider of such services that is eligible for participation in the medicare program with respect to such facility 

a reit is permitted to render a de minimis amount of impermissible services to tenants and still treat amounts received with respect to that property as rent from real property the amount received or accrued by the reit during the taxable year for the impermissible services with respect to a property may not exceed 1 of all amounts received or accrued by the reit directly or indirectly from the property the amount received for any service or management operation for this purpose shall be deemed to be not less than 150 of the direct cost of the reit in furnishing or rendering the service or providing the management or operation furthermore impermissible services may be furnished to tenants by a taxable reit subsidiary subject to certain conditions which would permit us to still treat rents received with respect to the property as rent from real property 

the term “interest” generally does not include any amount if the determination of the amount depends in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person although an amount generally will not be excluded from the term “interest” solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage of receipts or sales 

if we fail to satisfy one or both of the 75 or 95 gross income tests for any taxable year we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for such year if we are eligible for certain relief provisions provided by the internal revenue code these relief provisions generally will be available if 1 following our identification of the failure we file a schedule for such taxable year describing each item of our gross income and 2 the failure to meet such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect it is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions if these relief provisions apply a 100 tax is imposed on an amount equal to 1 the gross income attributable to i 75 of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75 income test and ii 95 of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 95 income test multiplied by 2 a fraction intended to reflect our profitability the secretary of the treasury is given broad authority to determine whether particular items of income or gain qualify under the 75 and 95 gross income tests and to exclude items from the measure of gross income for such purposes 

asset tests   within 30 days after the close of each quarter of our taxable year we must also satisfy several tests relating to the nature and diversification of our assets determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles at least 75 of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets including interests in real property interests in mortgages on real property or on interests in real property shares in other reits and debt instruments issued by publicly offered reits cash cash items including receivables arising in the ordinary course of our operation government securities and qualified temporary investments although the remaining 25 of our assets generally may be invested without restriction we are prohibited from owning securities representing more than 10 of either the vote the “10 vote test” or value the “10 value test” of the outstanding securities of any issuer other than a qualified reit subsidiary another reit or a taxable reit subsidiary further no more than 20 of our total assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries the “20 asset test” and no more than 5 of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities of any nongovernmental issuer other than a qualified reit subsidiary the “5 asset test” another reit or a taxable reit subsidiary each of the 10 vote test the 10 value test and the 20 and 5 asset tests must be satisfied at the end of each quarter there are special rules which provide relief if the valuerelated tests are not satisfied due to changes in the value of the assets of a reit 

certain items are excluded from the 10 value test including 1 straight debt securities meeting certain requirements 2 any loan to an individual or an estate 3 any rental agreement described in section 467 of the internal revenue code other than with a “related person” 4 any obligation to pay rents from real property 5 certain securities issued by a state or any subdivision thereof the district of columbia a foreign government or any political subdivision thereof or the commonwealth of puerto rico 6 any security issued by a reit and 7 any other arrangement that as determined by the secretary of the treasury is excepted from the definition of security “excluded securities” if a reit or its taxable reit subsidiary holds 1 straight debt securities of a corporate or partnership issuer and 2 securities of such issuer that are not excluded securities and have an aggregate value greater than 1 of such issuer’s outstanding securities the straight debt securities will be included in the 10 value test 

a reit’s interest as a partner in a partnership is not treated as a security for purposes of applying the 10 value test to securities issued by the partnership further any debt instrument issued by a partnership that is not an excluded security will not be a security for purposes of applying the 10 value test 1 to the extent of the reit’s interest as a partner in the partnership or 2 if at least 75 of the partnership’s gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions would qualify for the 75 gross income test for purposes of the 10 value test a reit’s interest in a partnership’s assets is determined by the reit’s proportionate interest in any securities issued by the partnership other than the excluded securities described in the preceding paragraph 

if a reit or its “qualified business unit” uses a foreign currency as its functional currency the term “cash” includes such foreign currency but only to the extent such foreign currency is i held for use in the normal course of the activities of the reit or “qualified business unit” which give rise to items of income or gain that are included in the 95 and 75 gross income tests or are directly related to acquiring or holding assets qualifying under the 75 asset test and ii not held in connection with dealing or engaging in substantial and regular trading in securities 

with respect to corrections of failures as to violations of the 10 vote test the 10 value test or the 5 asset test a reit may avoid disqualification as a reit by disposing of sufficient assets to cure a violation due to the ownership of assets that do not exceed the lesser of 1 of the reit’s assets at the end of the relevant quarter or 10000000 provided that the disposition occurs within six months following the last day of the quarter in which the reit first identified the assets for violations of any of the reit asset tests due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that exceed the thresholds described in the preceding sentence a reit can avoid disqualification as a reit after the close of a taxable quarter by taking certain steps including disposition of sufficient assets within the six month period described above to meet the applicable asset test paying a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets during the period of time that the assets were held as nonqualifying assets and filing a schedule with the internal revenue service that describes the nonqualifying assets 

investments in taxable reit subsidiaries reits may own more than 10 of the voting power and value of securities in taxable reit subsidiaries unlike a qualified reit subsidiary other disregarded entity or partnership the income and assets of a taxable reit subsidiary are not attributable to the reit for purposes of satisfying the income and asset ownership requirements applicable to reit qualification we and any taxable corporate entity in which we own an interest are allowed to jointly elect to treat such entity as a “taxable reit subsidiary” 

certain of our subsidiaries have elected taxable reit subsidiary status taxable reit subsidiaries are subject to full corporate level us federal taxation on their earnings but are permitted to engage in certain types of activities that cannot be performed directly by reits without jeopardizing their reit status our taxable reit subsidiaries will attempt to minimize the amount of these taxes but there can be no assurance whether or the extent to which measures taken to minimize taxes will be successful to the extent our taxable reit subsidiaries are required to pay us federal state or local taxes the cash available for distribution as dividends to us from our taxable reit subsidiaries will be reduced 

the internal revenue service may redetermine amounts from transactions between a reit and its taxable reit subsidiary where there is a lack of arm’slength dealing between the parties any taxable income allocated to or deductible expenses allocated away from a taxable reit subsidiary would increase its tax liability further certain amounts from certain transactions involving a reit and its taxable reit subsidiaries could be subject to a 100 tax if not conducted on an arm’s length basis additional taxable reit subsidiary elections may be made in the future for additional entities in which we obtain an interest 

annual distribution requirements in order to avoid being taxed as a regular corporation we are required to make distributions other than capital gain distributions to our stockholders which qualify for the dividends paid deduction in an amount at least equal to 1 the sum of i 90 of our “reit taxable income” computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain and ii 90 of the aftertax net income if any from foreclosure property minus 2 a portion of certain items of noncash income these distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for that year and if paid on or before the first regular distribution payment after such declaration prior to 2014 with respect to all reits the amount distributed could not be preferential this means that every stockholder of the class of stock to which a distribution is made must be treated the same as every other stockholder of that class and no class of stock may be treated otherwise than in accordance with its dividend rights as a class the “preferential dividend rule” beginning in tax years after 2014 the preferential dividend rule no longer applies to publicly offered reits however the rule is still applicable to other entities taxed as reits which would include several of our subsidiaries to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our “reit taxable income” as adjusted we will be subject to tax on the undistributed amount at regular corporate tax rates as discussed above we may be subject to an excise tax if we fail to meet certain other distribution requirements we believe we have satisfied the annual distribution requirements for the year of our initial reit election and each year thereafter through the year ended december 31 2020 although we intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy these annual distribution requirements for subsequent years economic market legal tax or other factors could limit our ability to meet those requirements see “item 1a  risk factors” 

it is also possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90 distribution requirement or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation due to among other things 1 timing differences between i the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses and ii the inclusion of income and deduction of expenses in arriving at our taxable income or 2 the payment of severance benefits that may not be deductible to us in the event that timing differences occur we may find it necessary to arrange for borrowings or if possible pay dividends in the form of taxable stock dividends in order to meet the distribution requirement 

under certain circumstances including in the event of a deficiency determined by the internal revenue service we may be able to rectify a resulting failure to meet the distribution requirement for a year by paying “deficiency dividends” to stockholders in a later year which may be included in our deduction for distributions paid for the earlier year thus we may be able to avoid being disqualified as a reit andor taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends however we will be required to pay applicable penalties and interest based upon the amount of any deduction taken for deficiency dividend distributions 

failure to qualify as a reit 

if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to us federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates distributions to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify as a reit will not be deductible nor will any particular amount of distributions be required to be made in any year all distributions to stockholders will be taxable as dividends to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these distributions and subject to certain limitations will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporate stockholders unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions we also will be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to statutory relief failure to qualify for even one year could result in our need to incur indebtedness or liquidate investments in order to pay potentially significant resulting tax liabilities 

in addition to the relief described above under “income tests” and “asset tests” relief is available in the event that we violate a provision of the internal revenue code that would result in our failure to qualify as a reit if 1 the violation is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect 2 we pay a penalty of 50000 for each failure to satisfy the provision and 3 the violation does not include a violation described under “income tests” or “asset tests” above it is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions 

us federal income taxation of holders of our stock 

treatment of taxable us stockholders the following summary applies to you only if you are a “us stockholder” a “us stockholder” is a holder of shares of stock who for us federal income tax purposes is 

• a citizen or resident of the united states 

• an entity classified as a corporation or partnership created or organized in or under the laws of the united states or of any political subdivision of the united states including any state 

• an estate the income of which is subject to us federal income taxation regardless of its source or 

• a trust if in general a us court is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or more us persons within the meaning of the internal revenue code has the authority to control all of the trust’s substantial decisions 

so long as we qualify for taxation as a reit distributions on shares of our stock made out of the current or accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these distributions and not designated as capital gain dividends will be taxable as dividends for us federal income tax purposes none of these distributions will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for us corporate stockholders 

generally the current maximum marginal rate of tax payable by individuals on dividends received from corporations that are subject to a corporate level of tax is 20 except in limited circumstances this tax rate will not apply to dividends paid to you by us on our shares because generally we are not subject to us federal income tax on the portion of our reit taxable income or capital gains distributed to our stockholders the reduced maximum us federal income tax rate will apply to that portion if any of dividends received by you with respect to our shares that are attributable to 1 dividends received by us from nonreit corporations or other taxable reit subsidiaries 2 income from the prior year with respect to which we were required to pay us federal corporate income tax during the prior year if for example we did not distribute 100 of our reit taxable income for the prior year or 3 the amount of any earnings and profits distributed by us and accumulated in a nonreit year 

although the preferential 20 rate on qualified dividends is generally not applicable to dividends to our shareholders the internal revenue code provides for a deduction from income for individuals trusts and estates for 20 of taxable reit dividends not eligible for the preferential rate excluding capital gain dividends this deduction is not taken into account for purposes of determining the 38 tax on net investment income described below and unlike the preferential rate expires after 2025 

distributions that are designated as capital gain dividends will be taxed as longterm capital gains to the extent they do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year without regard to the period for which you held our stock however if you are a corporation you may be required to treat a portion of some capital gain dividends as ordinary income 

if we elect to retain and pay income tax on any net capital gain and designate such amount in a timely notice to you you would include in income as longterm capital gain your proportionate share of this net capital gain you would also receive a refundable tax credit for your proportionate share of the tax paid by us on such retained capital gains and you would have an increase in the basis of your shares of our stock in an amount equal to your includable capital gains less your share of the tax deemed paid 

you may not include in your us federal income tax return any of our net operating losses or capital losses us federal income tax rules may also require that certain minimum tax adjustments and preferences be apportioned to you in addition any distribution declared by us in october november or december of any year on a specified date in any such month shall be treated as both paid by us and received by you on december 31 of that year provided that the distribution is actually paid by us no later than january 31 of the following year 

we will be treated as having sufficient earnings and profits to treat as a dividend any distribution up to the amount required to be distributed in order to avoid imposition of the 4 excise tax discussed under “general” and “qualification as a reit  annual distribution requirements” above as a result you may be required to treat as taxable dividends certain distributions that would otherwise result in a taxfree return of capital moreover any “deficiency dividend” will be treated as a dividend an ordinary dividend or a capital gain dividend as the case may be regardless of our earnings and profits any other distributions in excess of current or accumulated earnings and profits will generally not be taxable to you to the extent these distributions do not exceed the adjusted tax basis of your shares of our stock you will be required to reduce the tax basis of your shares of our stock by the amount of these distributions until the basis has been reduced to zero after which these distributions will be taxable as capital gain if the shares of our stock are held as capital assets the tax basis as so reduced will be used in computing the capital gain or loss if any realized upon the sale of the shares of our stock any loss upon a sale or exchange of shares of our stock which were held for six months or less after application of certain holding period rules will generally be treated as a longterm capital loss to the extent you previously received capital gain distributions with respect to these shares of our stock 

upon the sale or exchange of any shares of our stock to or with a person other than us or a sale or exchange of all shares of our stock whether actually or constructively owned with us you will generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your adjusted tax basis in these shares of our stock this gain or loss will be capital gain or loss if you held these shares of our stock as a capital asset 

if we redeem any of your shares in us the treatment can only be determined on the basis of particular facts at the time of redemption in general you will recognize gain or loss as opposed to dividend income equal to the difference between the amount received by you in the redemption and your adjusted tax basis in your shares redeemed if such redemption 1 results 

in a “complete termination” of your interest in all classes of our equity securities 2 is a “substantially disproportionate redemption” or 3 is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” with respect to you in applying these tests you must take into account your ownership of all classes of our equity securities eg common stock preferred stock depositary shares and warrants you also must take into account any equity securities that are considered to be constructively owned by you 

if as a result of a redemption by us of your shares you no longer own either actually or constructively any of our equity securities or only own actually and constructively an insubstantial percentage of our equity securities then it is probable that the redemption of your shares would be considered “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” and thus would result in gain or loss to you however whether a distribution is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” depends on all of the facts and circumstances and if you rely on any of these tests at the time of redemption you should consult your tax advisor to determine their application to the particular situation 

generally if the redemption does not meet the tests described above then the proceeds received by you from the redemption of your shares will be treated as a distribution taxable as a dividend to the extent of the allocable portion of current or accumulated earnings and profits if the redemption is taxed as a dividend your adjusted tax basis in the redeemed shares will be transferred to any other shareholdings in us that you own if you own no other shareholdings in us under certain circumstances such basis may be transferred to a related person or it may be lost entirely 

gain from the sale or exchange of our shares held for more than one year is generally taxed at a maximum longterm capital gain rate of 20 in the case of stockholders who are individuals and 21 in the case of stockholders that are corporations pursuant to internal revenue service guidance we may classify portions of our capital gain dividends as eligible for specific treatment provided under the internal revenue code which depending on the nature of the capital gains may result in taxation of such portions at rates of either 20 or 25 capital losses recognized by a stockholder upon the disposition of our shares held for more than one year at the time of disposition will be considered longterm capital losses the deduction for capital losses is subject to limitations 

an additional tax of 38 generally will be imposed on the “net investment income” of us stockholders who meet certain requirements and are individuals estates or certain trusts among other items “net investment income” generally includes gross income from dividends and net gain attributable to the disposition of certain property such as shares of our common stock or warrants in the case of individuals this tax will only apply to the extent such individual’s modified adjusted gross income exceeds 200000 250000 for married couples filing a joint return and surviving spouses and 125000 for married individuals filing a separate return us stockholders should consult their tax advisors regarding the possible applicability of this additional tax in their particular circumstances 

treatment of taxexempt us stockholders taxexempt entities including qualified employee pension and profit sharing trusts and individual retirement accounts “exempt organizations” generally are exempt from us federal income taxation however they are subject to taxation on their unrelated business taxable income “ubti” the internal revenue service has issued a published revenue ruling that dividend distributions from a reit to an exempt employee pension trust do not constitute ubti provided that the shares of the reit are not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business of the exempt employee pension trust based on this ruling amounts distributed by us to exempt organizations generally should not constitute ubti however if an exempt organization finances its acquisition of the shares of our stock with debt a portion of its income from us will constitute ubti pursuant to the “debt financed property” rules likewise a portion of the exempt organization’s income from us would constitute ubti if we held a residual interest in a real estate mortgage investment conduit a taxexempt us stockholder that is subject to tax on its ubti will be required to segregate its taxable income and loss for each unrelated trade or business activity for purposes of determining its ubti 

backup withholding and information reporting under certain circumstances you may be subject to backup withholding at applicable rates on payments made with respect to or cash proceeds of a sale or exchange of shares of our stock backup withholding will apply only if you 1 fail to provide a correct taxpayer identification number which if you are an individual is ordinarily your social security number 2 furnish an incorrect taxpayer identification number 3 are notified by the internal revenue service that you have failed to properly report payments of interest or dividends or 4 fail to certify under penalties of perjury that you have furnished a correct taxpayer identification number and that the internal revenue service has not notified you that you are subject to backup withholding 

backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients such as corporations and taxexempt organizations you should consult with a tax advisor regarding qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining an exemption backup withholding is not an additional tax rather the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a stockholder will be allowed as a credit against such stockholder’s us federal income tax liability and may entitle such stockholder to a refund provided that the required information is provided to the internal revenue service 

taxation of foreign stockholders the following summary applies to you only if you are a foreign person a “foreign person” is a holder of shares of stock who for us federal income tax purposes is not a us stockholder the us federal taxation of foreign persons is a highly complex matter that may be affected by many considerations 

except as discussed below distributions to you of cash generated by our real estate operations in the form of ordinary dividends but not by the sale or exchange of our capital assets generally will be subject to us withholding tax at a rate of 30 unless an applicable tax treaty reduces that tax and you file with us the required form evidencing the lower rate 

in general you will be subject to us federal income tax on a graduated rate basis rather than withholding with respect to your investment in our stock if such investment is “effectively connected” with your conduct of a trade or business in the united states a corporate foreign stockholder that receives income that is or is treated as effectively connected with a united states trade or business may also be subject to the branch profits tax which is payable in addition to regular united states corporate income tax the following discussion will apply to foreign stockholders whose investment in us is not so effectively connected we expect to withhold united states income tax as described below on the gross amount of any distributions paid to you unless 1 you file an internal revenue service form w8eci with us claiming that the distribution is “effectively connected” or 2 certain other exceptions apply 

distributions by us that are attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a united states real property interest will be taxed to you under the foreign investment in real property tax act of 1980 “firpta” as if these distributions were gains “effectively connected” with a united states trade or business accordingly you will be taxed at the normal capital gain rates applicable to a us stockholder on these amounts subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals distributions subject to firpta may also be subject to a branch profits tax in the hands of a corporate foreign stockholder that is not entitled to treaty exemption we will be required to withhold tax at a rate of 21 from distributions subject to firpta we will be required to withhold from distributions subject to firpta and remit to the internal revenue service 21 of designated capital gain dividends or if greater 21 of the amount of any distributions that could be designated as capital gain dividends in addition if we designate prior distributions as capital gain dividends subsequent distributions up to the amount of the prior distributions not withheld against will be treated as capital gain dividends for purposes of withholding

because the us generally maintains a worldwide corporate tax system the foreign and us tax systems are somewhat interdependent longstanding international tax norms that determine each country’s jurisdiction to tax crossborder international trade are evolving and could reduce the ability of our foreign subsidiaries to deduct for foreign tax purposes the interest they pay on loans from the company thereby increasing the foreign tax liability of the subsidiaries it is also possible that foreign countries could increase their withholding taxes on dividends and interest given the unpredictability of these possible changes and their potential interdependency it is very difficult to assess the overall effect of such potential tax changes on our earnings and cash flow but such changes could adversely impact our financial results

• risks arising from our status as a reit 

risks arising from our business 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic may continue to adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are unable to accurately predict the full impact that the covid19 pandemic will have on our results of operations financial condition liquidity and cash flows due to numerous factors that are not within our control these factors include the duration and severity of the outbreak availability and timely delivery and effectiveness of vaccines public health measures such as business closures and stayathome orders and other actions taken by governments businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic the availability of federal state local or nonus funding programs general economic disruption and uncertainty in key markets and financial market volatility and the impact of the covid19 pandemic on general macroeconomic conditions and the pace of recovery when the pandemic subsides 

the covid19 pandemic has subjected our business operations and financial condition to a number of risks including but not limited to those discussed below 

• risks related to revenue our revenues and our operators revenues are dependent on occupancy our seniors housing operating portfolio has experienced a decline in spot occupancy from 858 at february 29 2020 to 762 at december 31 2020 and 744 at february 5 2021 in addition to the impact of increases in mortality rates on occupancy of our seniors housing operating facilities the ongoing covid19 pandemic has to varying degrees during the course of the pandemic prevented prospective occupants and their families from visiting our facilities and limited the ability of new occupants to move into our facilities due to heightened movein criteria and screening although the ongoing impact of the pandemic and vaccine deployment on occupancy remain uncertain occupancy of our seniors housing operating and triplenet properties could further decrease such a decrease could affect the net operating income of our seniors housing operating properties and the ability of our triplenet operators to make contractual payments to us in addition although we collected over 98 of rent due in the fourth quarter of 2020 rental income in our outpatient medical segment may decrease if our tenants do not renew leases or do not make timely or full lease payments as a result of temporary medical practice closures or decreases in revenue due to government imposed restrictions on elective medical procedures or decisions by patients to delay treatments as a result of the financial impact of the covid19 pandemic on our operators and tenants we may offer certain tenants concessions such as rent deferrals or rent abatements across our triplenet and outpatient medical segments 

• risks related to operator and tenant financial condition in addition to decreased revenue from tenant and operator payments the impact of the covid19 pandemic creates a heightened risk of tenant operator borrower manager or other obligor bankruptcy or insolvency due to factors such as decreased occupancy medical practice disruptions resulting from stayathome orders increased health and safety and labor expenses or litigation resulting from developments related to the covid19 pandemic see  the insolvency or bankruptcy of our tenants operators borrowers managers and other obligors may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition for more information regarding operator and tenant bankruptcy risks our ability to terminate our lease with a tenant and relet the property to another tenant may be severely limited under current conditions due to the industry and macroeconomic effects of the covid19 pandemic and local ordinances if we cannot transition a leased property to a new tenant due to the effects of the covid19 pandemic or for other reasons we may take possession of that property which may expose us to certain successor liabilities publicity about the operators financial condition and insolvency proceedings particularly in light of ongoing publicity related to the covid19 pandemic may also negatively impact their and our reputations decreasing customer demand and revenues should such events occur our revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely affected 

• risks related to operations across all of our properties we and our operators have incurred increased operational costs as a result of the introduction of public health measures and other regulations affecting our properties and our operations as well as additional health and safety measures adopted by us and our operators related to the covid19 pandemic including increases in labor and property cleaning expenses and expenditures related to our efforts to procure ppe and supplies on behalf of our operators such operational costs may increase in the future based on the duration and severity of the pandemic or the introduction of additional public health regulations operators and tenants are also subject to risks arising from the unique pressures on seniors housing and medical practice employees during 

the covid19 pandemic as a result of difficult conditions and stresses related to the covid19 pandemic employee morale and productivity may suffer and additional pay such as hazard pay may not be sufficient to retain key operator and tenant employees in addition our operations or those of our operators or tenants may be adversely impacted if a significant number of our employees or those of our operators or tenants contract covid19 although we continue to undertake extensive efforts to ensure the safety of our properties employees and residents and to provide operator support in this regard the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our facilities could result in additional operational costs and reputational and litigation risk to us and our operators as a result of the covid19 pandemic operator and tenant cost of insurance is expected to increase and such insurance may not cover certain claims related to covid19 our exposure to covid19 related litigation risk may be increased if the operators or tenants of the relevant facilities are subject to bankruptcy or insolvency in addition to varying degrees during the course of the pandemic we have experienced increased operational challenges and costs resulting from logistical challenges such as supply chain interruptions business closures and restrictions on the movement of people in response to stayathome orders and to support the health and wellbeing of our employees the large majority of our employees are currently working remotely the effects of such work arrangements for an extended period of time could impact employee productivity and morale and introduce additional operational risk including but not limited to cybersecurity risks 

• risks related to property acquisitions and dispositions as a result of uncertainty regarding the length and severity of the covid19 pandemic and the impact of the pandemic on our business and related industries our investments in and acquisitions of seniors housing and health care properties as well as our ability to transition or sell properties with profitable results may be limited such disruptions to acquisition disposition and development activity may negatively impact our longterm competitive position 

• risks related to liquidity if our access to capital is restricted or our borrowing costs increase as a result of developments in financial markets relating to the pandemic our operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted in addition a prolonged period of decreased revenue and limited acquisition and disposition activity may adversely affect our financial condition and longterm growth prospects and there can also be no assurance that we will not face credit rating downgrades future downgrades could adversely affect our cost of capital liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets 

• risks related to dividends the impacts of the covid19 pandemic on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition could adversely affect our ability to pay dividend distributions at expected levels or at all all distributions are made at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with delaware law and depend on our earnings our financial condition debt and equity capital available to us our expectation of our future capital requirements and operating performance restrictive covenants in our financial and other contractual agreements maintenance of our reit qualification restrictions under delaware law and other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time our board of directors will continue to assess our dividend rate on an ongoing basis as the covid19 pandemic and related market conditions and our financial position continue to evolve our board of directors declared a cash dividend for the quarter ended december 31 2020 of 061 per share consistent with the cash dividends for the quarters ended september 30 june 30 and march 31 2020 representing a 30 decrease from the 087 per share dividend for the quarter ended december 31 2019 

the events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could in circumstances we may not be able to accurately predict recognize or control have a material adverse effect on our business growth reputation prospects financial condition operating results cash flows liquidity ability to pay dividends and stock price as the covid19 pandemic continues to adversely affect our operating and financial results it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the risk factors in this annual report on form 10k 

there remains uncertainty regarding the implementation and impact of the cares act and any future stimulus or other covid19 relief legislation there can be no assurance as to the amount of financial assistance we and our operators will receive or that we will be able to comply with the terms and conditions to keep such assistance 

in response to the covid19 pandemic the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act and the paycheck protection program and health care enhancement act ppphce act signed into law on march 20 2020 and april 24 2020 respectively authorized 175 billion in funding to be distributed to healthcare providers including assisted living facilities these funds distributed through the provider relief fund and administered by the department of health and human services are required to be used to prevent prepare for and respond to covid19 and reimburse expenses or lost revenues attributable the covid19 pandemic although these distributions are not subject to repayment attestation and compliance with certain terms and conditions including detailed reporting and auditing are required any funds that are ultimately received and retained by us are not expected to fully offset the losses incurred in our senior living portfolio that are attributable to the covid19 pandemic 

in 2020 applications were made for amounts under phase 2 and phase 3 of the provider relief fund following the announcement from the department of health and human services that it expanded the eligibility of the cares act to include assisted living facilities during the fourth quarter we received provider relief funds of approximately 9 million which was recognized as a reduction to property operating expenses to date in 2021 we have received approximately 34 million of 

provider relief funds while we have received some funds to date there can be no assurance that all of our applications will be approved or that additional funds will ultimately be received in full or in part 

our investments in and acquisitions of health care and seniors housing properties may be unsuccessful or fail to meet our expectations 

some of our acquisitions may not prove to be successful we could encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired properties including contingent liabilities and acquired properties might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business if we agree to provide construction funding to an operatortenant and the project is not completed we may need to take steps to ensure completion of the project such expenditures may negatively affect our results of operations investments in and acquisitions of seniors housing and health care properties entail risks associated with real estate investments generally including risks that the investment will not achieve expected returns that the cost estimates for necessary property improvements will prove inaccurate or that the tenant operator or manager will fail to meet performance expectations furthermore there can be no assurance that our anticipated acquisitions and investments the completion of which is subject to various conditions will be consummated in accordance with anticipated timing on anticipated terms or at all we may be unable to obtain or assume financing for acquisitions on favorable terms or at all health care properties are often highly customizable and the development or redevelopment of such properties may require costly tenantspecific improvements we also may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties into our existing operations and this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition acquired properties may be located in new markets either within or outside the united states where we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy lack of business relationships in the area costs associated with opening a new regional office and unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures as a result we cannot assure you that we will achieve the economic benefit we expect from acquisitions investment development and redevelopment opportunities 

acquired properties may expose us to unknown liability 

we may acquire properties or invest in joint ventures that own properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse or with only limited recourse against the prior owners or other third parties with respect to unknown liabilities as a result if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties we might have to pay substantial sums to settle or contest it which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow unknown liabilities with respect to acquired properties might include liabilities for cleanup of undisclosed environmental contamination claims by tenants vendors or other persons against the former owners of the properties liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business and claims for indemnification by general partners directors and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties 

competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties 

we may face competition for acquisition opportunities from other wellcapitalized investors including publicly traded and privately held reits private real estate funds domestic and foreign financial institutions life insurance companies sovereign wealth funds pension trusts partnerships and individual investors this competition may adversely affect us by subjecting us to the following risks we may be unable to acquire a desired property because of competition from other wellcapitalized real estate investors and even if we are able to acquire a desired property competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price 

our investments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by our lack of exclusive control over these investments our partners’ insolvency or failure to meet their obligations and disputes between us and our partners   

we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into partnerships or joint ventures with other persons or entities joint venture investments involve risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership including the possibility that our partner might become insolvent refuse to make capital contributions when due or otherwise fail to meet its obligations which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments that our partner might at any time have economic or other business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our interests or goals that we could become engaged in a dispute with our partner which could require us to expend additional resources to resolve such dispute and could have an adverse impact on the operations and profitability of the joint venture that our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests and that our joint venture partners may be structured differently than us for tax purposes which could create conflicts of interest and risks to our reit status in some instances we andor our partner may have the right to trigger a buysell put right or forced sale arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest acquire our partner’s interest or sell the underlying asset at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction our ability to acquire our partner’s interest may be limited if we do not have sufficient cash available borrowing capacity or other capital resources in such event we may be forced to sell our interest in the joint venture when we would otherwise prefer to retain it on the other hand our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted and the market for our interest may be limited andor valued lower than fair market value joint ventures may require us to share decisionmaking authority with our partners which could limit our ability to control the properties in the joint ventures even when we have a controlling interest certain major decisions may require partner approval such as the sale acquisition or financing of a property 

we assume operational and legal risks with respect to our properties managed in ridea structures that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we have entered into various joint ventures that were structured under the provisions of the reit investment diversification and empowerment act of 2007 “ridea” which permits reits to own or partially own “qualified health care properties” in a structure through which we can participate directly in the cash flow of the properties’ operations as compared to receiving only contractual rent payments in compliance with reit requirements a “qualified health care property” includes real property and any personal property that is or is necessary or incidental to the use of a hospital nursing facility assisted living facility congregate care facility qualified continuing care facility or other licensed facility which extends medical or nursing or ancillary services to patients 

under a ridea structure we are required to rely on our operator to manage and operate the property including complying with laws and providing resident care however as the owner of the property under a ridea structure we are responsible for operational and legal risks and liabilities of the property including but not limited to those relating to employment matters of our operators compliance with health care fraud and abuse and other laws governmental reimbursement matters compliance with federal state local and industryrelated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards and litigation involving our properties or residentspatients even though we have limited ability to control or influence our operators’ management of these risks further our taxable reit subsidiary “trs” is generally required to hold the applicable health care license and enroll in the applicable government health care programs eg medicare and medicaid which subjects us to potential liability under various health care regulatory laws penalties for failure to comply with applicable laws may include loss or suspension of licenses and certificates of need certification or accreditation exclusion from government health care programs eg medicare and medicaid administrative sanctions and civil monetary penalties although we have some general oversight approval rights and the right to review operational and financial reporting information our operators are ultimately in control of the daytoday business of the property including clinical decisionmaking and we rely on them to operate the properties in a manner that complies with applicable law 

we are exposed to operational risks with respect to our seniors housing operating properties that could adversely affect our revenue and operations 

we are exposed to various operational risks with respect to our seniors housing operating properties that may increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to generate revenues in addition to operational challenges related to the covid19 pandemic these risks include fluctuations in occupancy experienced during the normal course of business medicare and medicaid reimbursement if applicable and private pay rates economic conditions competition federal state local and industryregulated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards the availability and increases in cost of general and professional liability insurance coverage increases in property taxes state regulation and rights of residents related to entrance fees federal and state housing laws and regulations including rent and eviction restrictions related to the covid19 pandemic and the availability and increases in the cost of labor as a result of unionization or otherwise any one or a combination of these factors may adversely affect our revenue and operations 

we have rights to terminate our management agreements with operators in whole or with respect to specific properties under certain circumstances and we may be unable to replace if our management agreements are terminated or not renewed 

we are parties to longterm management agreements with our seniors housing operating managers pursuant to which they provide comprehensive property management accounting and other services with respect to our seniors housing operating properties we have the ability to terminate any of our management agreements upon the occurrence of certain events such as insolvency relating to such manager and in some cases the failure to meet specific noi targets without curing as well as the occurrence of other events or certain conditions 

we regularly monitor and review our rights and remedies under our management agreements when determining if we will take significant action under those agreements including terminating a manager we consider numerous legal contractual regulatory business and other relevant factors in exercising our rights to terminate or not renew a management agreement we would work with our existing seniors housing operators or potentially new operators to manage the properties however there is no assurance that we would be able to timely source a replacement or that any replacement manager would be effective any transition to a new manager would most likely require regulatory approval and potentially the approval of the holders of any liens on the property the failure to replace on a timely basis as well as the failure to receive these approvals either at all or in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on the properties and our revenue 

decreases in our operators’ revenues or increases in our operators’ expenses could affect our operators’ ability to make payments to us 

we have very limited control over the success or failure of our operators businesses and at any time an operator may experience a downturn in its business that weakens its financial condition our operators’ revenues are primarily driven by occupancy private pay rates and medicare and medicaid reimbursement if applicable expenses for these facilities are 

primarily driven by the costs of labor food utilities taxes insurance and rent or debt service revenues from government reimbursement have and may continue to come under pressure due to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls operating costs continue to increase for our operators to the extent that any decrease in revenues andor any increase in operating expenses result in a property not generating enough cash to make payments to us the credit of our operator and the value of other collateral would have to be relied upon to the extent the value of such property is reduced we may need to record an impairment for such asset furthermore if we determine to dispose of an underperforming property such sale may result in a loss any such impairment or loss on sale would negatively affect our financial results these risks are magnified where we lease multiple properties to a single operator under a master lease as an operator failure or default under a master lease would expose us to these risks across multiple properties although our lease agreements give us the right to exercise certain remedies in the event of default on the obligations owing to us we may determine not to do so if we believe that enforcement of our rights would be more detrimental to our business than seeking alternative approaches 

increased competition and oversupply may affect our operators’ and managers ability to meet their obligations to us   

the operators and managers of our properties compete on a local and regional basis with operators and managers of properties and other health care providers that provide comparable services for residents and patients including on the basis of the scope and quality of care and services provided reputation and financial condition physical appearance of the properties price and location our operators and managers are expected to encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to attract residents or expand their businesses in addition we expect that there will continue to be a more than adequate inventory of seniors housing facilities we cannot be certain that the operators of all of our facilities will be able to achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels that meet our expected yields and fulfill their obligations to us including but not limited to the results of the covid19 pandemic if our operators and managers cannot compete effectively or if there is an oversupply of facilities their financial performance could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

a severe cold and flu season epidemics or any other widespread illnesses could adversely affect the occupancy of our seniors housing operating and triplenet properties 

in addition to the impact of the covid19 pandemic our business and operations are exposed to risks from severe cold and flu seasons or the occurrence of epidemics or any other widespread illnesses our revenues and our operators revenues are dependent on occupancy and the occupancy of our seniors housing operating and triplenet properties could significantly decrease in the event of a severe cold and flu season an epidemic or any other widespread illness such a decrease could affect the operating income of our seniors housing operating properties and the ability of our triplenet operators to make payments to us as experienced during the covid19 pandemic a future flu or other pandemic could significantly increase the cost burdens faced by our operators including if they are required to implement quarantines for residents and adversely affect their ability to meet their obligations to us which would have a material adverse effect on our financial results   

the insolvency or bankruptcy of our tenants operators borrowers managers and other obligors may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition   

we are exposed to the risk that our tenants operators borrowers managers or other obligors may not be able to meet the rent principal and interest or other payments due us which may result in a tenant operator borrower manager or other obligor bankruptcy or insolvency or that a tenant operator borrower manager or other obligor might become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings for other reasons although our operating lease agreements provide us with the right to evict a tenant demand immediate payment of rent and exercise other remedies and our loans provide us with the right to terminate any funding obligation demand immediate repayment of principal and unpaid interest foreclose on the collateral and exercise other remedies the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization a tenant operator borrower manager or other obligor in bankruptcy or subject to insolvency proceedings may be able to limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent in the case of a lease or to receive unpaid principal and interest in the case of a loan and to exercise other rights and remedies in addition if a lease is rejected in a tenant bankruptcy our claim against the tenant may be limited by applicable provisions of the bankruptcy law we may be required to fund certain expenses eg real estate taxes and maintenance to preserve the value of an investment property avoid the imposition of liens on a property andor transition a property to a new tenant in some instances we have terminated our lease with a tenant and relet the property to another tenant in some of those situations we have provided working capital loans to and limited indemnification of the new obligor if we cannot transition a leased property to a new tenant we may take possession of that property which may expose us to certain successor liabilities publicity about the operators financial condition and insolvency proceedings may also negatively impact their and our reputations decreasing customer demand and revenues should such events occur our revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely affected 

we may not be able to timely reinvest our sale proceeds on terms acceptable to us   

from time to time we will have cash available from the proceeds of sales of our securities principal payments on our loans receivable or the sale of properties including nonelective dispositions under the terms of master leases or similar financial support arrangements in order to maintain current revenues and continue generating attractive returns we expect to reinvest these proceeds in a timely manner we compete for real estate investments with a broad variety of potential investors including 

other health care reits real estate partnerships health care providers health care lenders and other investors including developers banks insurance companies pension funds governmentsponsored entities and private equity firms some of whom may have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do this competition for attractive investments may negatively affect our ability to make timely investments on terms acceptable to us   in addition our ability to execute on our real estate investment strategies may be temporarily disrupted during periods of financial market volatility or real estate and health care industry market uncertainty including as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

the properties managed by sunrise senior living llc “sunrise” account for a significant portion of our revenues and net operating income and any adverse developments in its business or financial condition could adversely affect us 

as of december 31 2020 sunrise managed 165 of our seniors housing operating properties these properties account for a significant portion of our revenues and net operating income although we have various rights as the property owner under our management agreements we rely on sunrise’s personnel expertise technical resources and information systems proprietary information good faith and judgment to manage our seniors housing operating properties efficiently and effectively we also rely on sunrise to set appropriate resident fees to provide accurate propertylevel financial results for our properties in a timely manner and to otherwise operate them in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations any adverse developments in sunrise’s business or financial condition could impair its ability to manage our properties efficiently and effectively which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition for example we depend on sunrise’s ability to attract and retain skilled management personnel who are responsible for the daytoday operations of our seniors housing operating properties a shortage of nurses or other trained personnel or general inflationary pressures may force sunrise to enhance its pay and benefits packages to compete effectively for such personnel but it may not be able to offset these added costs by increasing the rates charged to residents any increase in labor costs and other property operating expenses any failure by sunrise to attract and retain qualified personnel or significant changes in sunrise’s senior management or equity ownership could adversely affect the income we receive from our seniors housing operating properties and have a material adverse effect on us also if sunrise experiences any significant financial legal accounting or regulatory difficulties such difficulties could result in among other things acceleration of its indebtedness impairment of its continued access to capital or the commencement of insolvency proceedings by or against it under the us bankruptcy code which in turn could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition if we determine to sell or transition properties currently managed by sunrise we may experience operational challenges andor significantly declining financial performance for those properties see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

we depend on promedica health system promedica and genesis healthcare “genesis” for a significant portion of our revenues and any failure inability or unwillingness by them to satisfy obligations under their agreements with us could adversely affect us   

the properties we lease to promedica and genesis account for a significant portion of our revenues and because these leases are triplenet leases we also depend on promedica and genesis to pay all insurance taxes utilities and maintenance and repair expenses in connection with the leased properties we cannot assure you that promedica and genesis will have sufficient assets income and access to financing to enable them to make rental payments to us or to otherwise satisfy their respective obligations under our leases and any failure inability or unwillingness by promedica and genesis to do so could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition promedica and genesis have also agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses and we cannot assure you that promedica and genesis will have sufficient assets income access to financing and insurance coverage to enable them to satisfy their respective indemnification obligations promedica and genesiss failure to effectively conduct their operations or to maintain and improve our properties could adversely affect their business reputations and their ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties which in turn could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition additionally we have made loans to genesis and their operational or other failures could adversely impact their ability to repay these loans when due during 2020 genesis indicated substantial doubt as to their ability to continue as a going concern effective july 1 2020 we revised our method of revenue recognition to a cashbasis accounting method from a straightline accounting method and wrote off existing straightline rent receivable balances of 91025000 in addition during 2020 we recognized 80873000 of provision for loan losses with respect to our genesis loan portfolio as of december 31 2020 genesis is current on all obligations to us 

ownership of property outside the us may subject us to different or greater risks than those associated with our domestic operations   

we have operations in the uk and canada which represent 98 and 94 of total welltower revenues respectively as of december 31 2020 revera managed 94 of our seniors housing operating properties in canada representing a significant portion of our revenues and also owned a controlling interest in sunrise international development ownership and operating activities involve risks that are different from those we face with respect to our domestic properties and operations these risks include but are not limited to any international currency gain or loss recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates which may not qualify under the 75 gross income test or the 95 gross income test required for us to satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a reit challenges with respect to the repatriation of foreign earnings and cash impact 

from international trade disputes and the associated impact on our tenants supply chain and consumer spending levels changes in foreign political regulatory and economic conditions regionally nationally and locally including but not limited to the macroeconomic and regulatory effects of brexit including impacts on the uk real estate market challenges in managing international operations challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations including those relating to real estate corporate governance operations taxes employment and other civil and criminal legal proceedings foreign ownership restrictions with respect to operations in foreign countries local businesses and cultural factors that differ from our usual standards and practices differences in lending practices and the willingness of domestic or foreign lenders to provide financing regional or countryspecific business cycles and political and economic instability and failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations in the us that affect foreign operations including but not limited to the us foreign corrupt practices act if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with international expansion and operations our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected   

the business and financial results of our operations located in the uk may be negatively impacted as a result of brexit 

the future relationship between the uk and the eu as well as the legal and economic consequences of those terms remain unclear including with respect to the postbrexit regulatory environment in the uk it is possible that the level of health care and other economic activity in the uk will be adversely impacted by the uks withdrawal from the eu in 2020 commonly referred to as brexit and that we will face increased regulatory and legal complexities which could have an adverse impact on the financial condition and results of operations of our properties in the uk 

moreover the value of the british pound sterling incurred significant fluctuations if the value of the british pound sterling continues to incur similar fluctuations unfavorable exchange rate changes may negatively affect the value of our operations located in the uk as translated to our reporting currency the us dollar in accordance with us gaap which may impact the revenue and earnings we report continued fluctuations in the british pound sterling may also result in the imposition of price adjustments by eubased suppliers to our uk operations as those suppliers seek to compensate for the changes in value of the british pound sterling as compared to the european euro 

if our tenants do not renew their existing leases or if we are required to sell properties for liquidity reasons we may be unable to lease or sell the properties on favorable terms or at all 

we cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases at the end of their lease terms which expire at various times if these leases are not renewed we would be required to find other tenants to occupy those properties or sell them there can be no assurance that we would be able to identify suitable replacement tenants or enter into leases with new tenants on terms as favorable to us as the current leases or that we would be able to lease those properties at all our competitors may offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our customers we may lose potential customers and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge to retain customers when leases expire in addition our ability to reposition our properties with a suitable replacement tenant or operator could be significantly delayed or limited by state licensing receivership con or other laws as well as by the medicare and medicaid changeofownership rules and we could incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any licensing receivership or changeofownership proceedings even if tenants decide to renew or lease new space the terms of renewals or new leases including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants may be less favorable to us than current lease terms 

real estate investments are relatively illiquid and most of the property we own is highly customized for specific uses our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in operator economic and other conditions will be limited no assurances can be given that we will recognize full value for any property that we are required to sell our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition we are exposed to the risks inherent in concentrating investments in real estate and in particular the seniors housing and health care industries a downturn in the real estate industry could adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to sell properties for a price or on terms acceptable to us 

our tenants operators and managers may not have the necessary insurance coverage to insure adequately against losses   

we maintain or require our tenants operators and managers to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties and their operations with terms conditions limits and deductibles that we believe are customary for similarly situated companies in our industry and we frequently review our insurance programs and requirements our tenants operators and manager may not be able to maintain adequate levels of insurance and required coverages also we may not be able to require the same levels of insurance coverage under our lease management and other agreements which could adversely affect us in the event of a significant uninsured loss we cannot make any guarantee as to the future financial viability of the insurers that underwrite our policies and the policies maintained by our tenants operators and managers insurance may not be available at a reasonable cost in the future or policies may not be maintained at a level that will fully cover all losses on our properties upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event this may be especially the case due to increases in property insurance costs in addition in recent years longtermpostacute care and seniors housing operators and managers have experienced substantial increases in both the number and size of patient care liability claims as a result general and professional liability costs have increased in some markets due to the uncertainty of the long term effects of the covid19 pandemic general and professional liability insurance coverage may be restricted or very costly which may adversely affect the tenants’ operators’ and managers’ future 

operations cash flows and financial conditions and may have a material adverse effect on the tenants’ operators’ and managers’ ability to meet their obligations to us 

our ownership of properties through ground leases exposes us to the loss of such properties upon breach or termination of the ground leases   

we have acquired an interest in certain of our properties by acquiring a leasehold interest in the property on which the building is located and we may acquire additional properties in the future through the purchase of interests in ground leases many of these ground leases impose significant limitations on our uses of the subject properties restrict our ability to sell or otherwise transfer our interests in the properties or restrict the leasing of the properties these restrictions may limit our ability to timely sell or exchange the properties impair the properties’ value or negatively impact our ability to find suitable tenants for the properties as the lessee under a ground lease we are exposed to the possibility of losing the property upon termination of the ground lease or an earlier breach of the ground lease by us 

the requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare medicaid or government funding could have a material adverse effect on our obligors’ liquidity financial condition and results of operations which could adversely affect our obligors’ ability to meet their obligations to us   

some of our obligors’ businesses are affected by government reimbursement to the extent that an operatortenant receives a significant portion of its revenues from government payors primarily medicare and medicaid such revenues may be subject to statutory and regulatory changes retroactive rate adjustments recovery of program overpayments or setoffs court decisions administrative rulings policy interpretations payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers government funding restrictions at a program level or with respect to specific facilities any lapse in congressional funding of the centers for medicare and medicaid services and interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing government investigations and audits at such property in recent years government payors have frozen or reduced payments to health care providers due to budgetary pressures federal and state authorities may continue seeking to implement new or modified reimbursement methodologies that may negatively impact health care property operations see “item 1  business  certain government regulations  united states  reimbursement” above for additional information health care reimbursement will likely continue to be of paramount importance to federal and state authorities we cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or effect any future legislative reforms may have on the financial condition of our obligors and properties there can be no assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will be available for services provided by any property operator whether the property receives reimbursement from medicare medicaid or private payors significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on an obligor’s liquidity financial condition and results of operations which could adversely affect the ability of an obligor to meet its obligations to us 

since january 1 2014 the health reform laws have provided those states that expand their medicaid coverage to otherwise eligible state residents with incomes at or below 138 of the federal poverty level with an increased federal medical assistance percentage effective january 1 2014 when certain conditions are met given that the federal government substantially funds the medicaid expansion it is unclear how many states will ultimately pursue this option although as of early january 2021 more than 75 of the states have expanded medicaid coverage the participation by states in the medicaid expansion could have the dual effect of increasing our tenants’ revenues through new patients but further straining state budgets and their ability to pay our tenants 

the status of the health reform laws may be subject to change as a result of political legislative regulatory and administrative developments and judicial proceedings for example the us supreme court heard oral argument in a case seeking to invalidate the affordable care act on november 10 2020 with a decision expected to be issued in 2021 additionally while the trump administration and prior us congresses have sought to modify repeal or otherwise invalidate all or certain provisions of the health reform laws including medicaid expansion there is uncertainty with respect to the impact the biden administration and the new us congress may have upon the health reform laws if the operations cash flows or financial condition of our operators and tenants are materially adversely impacted by the health reform laws or future legislation our revenue and operations may be adversely affected as well more generally and because of the dynamic nature of the legislative and regulatory environment for health care products and services and in light of existing federal deficit and budgetary concerns we cannot predict the impact that broadbased farreaching legislative or regulatory changes could have on the us economy our business or that of our operators and tenants 

if controls imposed on certain of our tenants who provide health care services that are reimbursed by medicare medicaid and other thirdparty payors to reduce admissions and length of stay affect inpatient volumes at our health care facilities the financial condition or results of operations of those tenants could be adversely affected 

controls imposed by medicare medicaid and commercial thirdparty payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay commonly referred to as “utilization reviews” have affected and are expected to continue to affect certain of our health care facilities specifically our acute care hospitals and postacute facilities utilization review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by managed care plans inpatient utilization average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payorrequired preadmission authorization and utilization review and by payor pressures to maximize outpatient and alternative health care delivery services for less acutely ill patients efforts to 

impose more stringent cost controls and reductions are expected to continue which could negatively impact the financial condition of our tenants who provide health care services in our hospitals and postacute facilities if so this could adversely affect these tenants’ ability and willingness to comply with the terms of their leases with us andor renew those leases upon expiration which could have a material adverse effect on us 

our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with federal state province local and industryregulated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards could adversely affect such operators’ or tenants’ operations which could adversely affect our operators’ and tenants’ ability to meet their obligations to us   

our operators and tenants generally are subject to or impacted by varying levels of federal state local and industryregulated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards these laws and regulations include among others laws protecting consumers against deceptive practices laws relating to the operation of our properties and how our tenants and operators conduct their business such as fire health and safety data security and privacy laws federal and state laws affecting hospitals clinics and other health care communities that participate in both medicare and medicaid that specify reimbursement rates pricing reimbursement procedures and limitations quality of services and care background checks food service and physical plants and similar foreign laws regulating the health care industry resident rights laws including abuse and neglect laws and fraud laws antikickback and physician referral laws the ada and similar state and local laws and safety and health standards set by the occupational safety and health administration or similar foreign agencies our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with any of these laws regulations or standards could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension decertification or exclusion from federal and state health care programs civil liability and in certain limited instances criminal penalties loss of license closure of the facility andor the incurrence of considerable costs arising from an investigation or regulatory action the likelihood of these actions may increase due to the uncertainty of the long term effects of the covid19 pandemic such actions may have an effect on our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make lease payments to us and therefore adversely impact us in addition we may be directly subject to certain health care fraud and abuse laws and data privacy laws as well as potential investigation or enforcement as a result of our rideastructured arrangements and certain other arrangements we may pursue with healthcare entities who are directly subject to these laws see “item 1  business  certain government regulations  united states  fraud  abuse enforcement” and “item 1  business  certain government regulations  united states  health care matters  generally” above 

many of our properties may require a license registration andor con to operate failure to obtain a license registration or con or loss of a required license registration or con would prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by the operators or tenants these events could materially adversely affect our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make rent or other obligatory payments to us state and local laws also may regulate the expansion including the addition of new beds or services or acquisition of medical equipment and the construction or renovation of health care facilities by requiring a con or other similar approval from a state agency see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — united states — licensing and certification” above 

in addition we cannot assure you that future changes in government regulation will not adversely affect the health care industry including our tenants and operators nor can we be certain that our tenants and operators will achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels or labor cost levels that will enable them to satisfy their obligations to us 

unfavorable resolution of pending and future litigation matters and disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

from time to time we are directly involved or named as a party in in legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims that involve class actions disputes regarding property damage care matters and other issues we also are named as defendants in lawsuits allegedly arising out of our actions or the actions of our operatorstenants or managers in which such operatorstenants or managers have agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail in or achieve a favorable settlement of pending or future litigation in addition pending litigation or future litigation government proceedings or environmental matters could lead to increased costs or interruption of our normal business operations an unfavorable resolution of pending or future litigation or legal proceedings may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition regardless of its outcome litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses significantly divert the attention of management and could damage our reputation and our brand in addition any such resolution could involve our agreement to terms that restrict the operation of our business we cannot guarantee losses incurred in connection with any current or future legal or regulatory proceedings or actions will not exceed any provisions we may have set aside in respect of such proceedings or actions or will not exceed any available insurance coverage 

development redevelopment and construction risks could affect our profitability 

in connection with our renovation redevelopment development and related construction activities we may be unable to obtain or suffer delays in obtaining necessary zoning landuse building occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations these factors could result in increased costs or our abandonment of these projects in addition we may abandon opportunities we have begun to investigate for a range of reasons including changes in expected financing or 

construction costs adverse changes in expected rents or expenses adverse environmental findings or conditions to zoning approval which would result in additional expenses beyond those originally expected in addition we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all which may render us unable to proceed with our development activities we may not be able to complete construction and leaseup of a property on budget and on schedule which could result in increased debt service expense or construction costs additionally the time frame required for development construction and leaseup of these properties means that we may have to wait years for significant cash returns because we are required to make cash distributions to our stockholders if the cash flow from operations or refinancing is not sufficient we may be forced to borrow additional money to fund such distributions newly developed and acquired properties may not produce the cash flow that we expect which could adversely affect our overall financial performance 

in deciding whether to acquire or develop a particular property we make assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property in particular we estimate the return on our investment based on expected occupancy rental rates operating expenses capital costs and future competition if our financial projections with respect to a new property are inaccurate the property may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment our estimate of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove to be inaccurate which may result in our failure to meet our profitability goals additionally we may acquire new properties that are not fully leased and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with that property   

operators of new facilities we construct may need to obtain medicare and medicaid certification and enter into medicare and medicaid provider agreements andor thirdparty payor contracts in the event that the operator is unable to obtain the necessary licensure certification provider agreements or contracts after the completion of construction there is a risk that we will not be able to earn any revenues on the facility until either the initial operator obtains a license or certification to operate the new facility and the necessary provider agreements or contracts or we find and contract with a new operator that is able to obtain a license to operate the facility for its intended use and the necessary provider agreements or contracts 

we may experience losses caused by severe weather conditions natural disasters or the physical effects of climate change which could result in an increase of our or our tenants’ cost of insurance unanticipated costs associated with evacuation a decrease in our anticipated revenues or a significant loss of the capital we have invested in a property   

we maintain or require our tenants to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties with terms conditions limits and deductibles that we believe are appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage however a large number of our properties are located in areas particularly susceptible to revenue loss cost increase or damage caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters such as hurricanes earthquakes tornadoes and floods as well as the effects of climate change we believe given current industry practice and analysis prepared by outside consultants that our and our tenants’ insurance coverage is appropriate to cover reasonably anticipated losses that may be caused by hurricanes earthquakes tornadoes floods wildfires and other severe weather conditions and natural disasters including the effects of climate change nevertheless we are always subject to the risk that such insurance will not fully cover all losses and depending on the severity of the event and the impact on our properties such insurance may not cover a significant portion of the losses including but not limited to the costs associated with evacuation these losses may lead to an increase of our and our tenants’ cost of insurance a decrease in our anticipated revenues from an affected property and a loss of all or a portion of the capital we have invested in an affected property in addition we or our tenants may not purchase insurance under certain circumstances if the cost of insurance exceeds in our or our tenants’ judgment the value of the coverage relative to the risk of loss also changes in federal and state legislation and regulation relating to climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency and resiliency of our existing properties and could also necessitate us to spend more on our new development properties without a corresponding increase in revenue 

to the extent that significant changes in the climate occur in areas where our communities are located we may experience extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature all of which may result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions should the impact of climate change be material including significant property damage to or destruction of our communities or occur for lengthy periods of time our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected in addition changes in federal state and local legislation and regulation based on concerns about climate change could result in increased capital expenditures on our existing properties and our new development properties without a corresponding increase in revenue resulting in adverse impacts to our net income 

we may incur costs to remediate environmental contamination at our properties which could have an adverse effect on our or our obligors’ business or financial condition 

under various laws owners or operators of real estate may be required to respond to the presence or release of hazardous substances on the property and may be held liable for property damage personal injuries or penalties that result from environmental contamination or exposure to hazardous substances these laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of the release of the substances or caused the release we may become liable to reimburse the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination generally such liability attaches to a person based on the person’s relationship to the property our tenants or borrowers are primarily responsible for the condition of the property moreover we review environmental site assessments of the properties that we own or encumber prior to taking an 

interest in them those assessments are designed to meet the “all appropriate inquiry” standard which we believe qualifies us for the innocent purchaser defense if environmental liabilities arise based upon such assessments we do not believe that any of our properties are subject to material environmental contamination however environmental liabilities may be present in our properties and we may incur costs to remediate contamination which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition or the business or financial condition of our obligors   

cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our business and result in the loss of confidential information 

our business is at risk from and may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential data through phishing or other malicious activity attempts to interrupt our access to or use of information technology systems through distributed denialofservice or ransomware attacks breaches related to our increased receipt and use of data from multiple sources and other electronic security breaches or other cybersecurity incidents within our environment or our third party vendors environments including those resulting from human error product defects and technology failures such cyberattacks can range from individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our or our vendors information technology systems to more sophisticated security threats and may be specifically targeted to our business or more general industry wide risks our information technology networks suppliers and related systems are essential to our ability to perform daytoday operations of our business while we employ a number of measures to prevent detect and mitigate these threats there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing or detecting a cyberattack even the most wellprotected information networks systems and facilities remain vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted cybersecurity breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target and in some cases are designed not to be detected and in fact may not be detected accordingly we may be unable to anticipate these techniques implement adequate cybersecurity barriers or other preventative measures or recover from an attack without operational impact and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk in the past we have experienced cybersecurity breaches which to date have not had a material impact on our operations however there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future we must continuously monitor and develop our systems to protect our technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our business damage our reputation cause us to incur significant remediation expense and have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations   cybersecurity breaches that compromise proprietary personal identifying or confidential information of our employees operators tenants and partners or result in operational disruptions could result in legal claims or proceedings including enforcement actions by regulators under data privacy regulations such as the uk general data protection regulation which imposes administrative fines for serious breaches up to the greater of 4 of annual worldwide turnover or £175 million 

our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed 

our success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel including our executive officers and other highly qualified employees and competition for their talents is intense there is substantial competition for qualified personnel we cannot assure you that we will retain our key personnel or that we will be able to recruit and retain other highly qualified employees in the future losing any key personnel could at least temporarily have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations   

risks arising from our capital structure   

we may become more leveraged   

permanent financing for our investments is typically provided through a combination of public offerings of debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt the incurrence or assumption of indebtedness may cause us to become more leveraged which could 1 require us to dedicate a greater portion of our cash flow to the payment of debt service 2 make us more vulnerable to a downturn in the economy 3 limit our ability to obtain additional financing 4 negatively affect our credit ratings or outlook by one or more of the rating agencies or 5 make us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates because of the variable interest rates on some of our borrowings to the extent we have not entirely hedged such variable rate debt 

cash available for distributions to stockholders may be insufficient to make dividend contributions at expected levels and are made at the discretion of the board of directors   

if cash available for distribution generated by our assets decreases due to dispositions or otherwise we may be unable to make dividend distributions at expected levels our inability to make expected distributions would likely result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock all distributions are made at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with delaware law and depend on our earnings our financial condition debt and equity capital available to us our expectation of our future capital requirements and operating performance restrictive covenants in our financial and other contractual arrangements maintenance of our reit qualification restrictions under delaware law and other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time additionally our ability to make distributions will be adversely affected if any of the risks described herein or other significant adverse events occur   

we are subject to covenants in our debt agreements that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our debt agreements contain various covenants restrictions and events of default among other things these provisions require us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness create liens and make investments or acquisitions breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness in addition to any other indebtedness crossdefaulted against such instruments these defaults could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to make future investments or to meet our obligations and commitments 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the capital necessary to make future investments or to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature our access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control including rising interest rates inflation and other general market conditions the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions the market price of the shares of our common stock and the credit ratings of our debt securities changes in the credit ratings on us government debt securities uncertainty from the expected discontinuance of libor and the transition to any other interest rate benchmark and default or delay in payment by the us of its obligations we also rely on the financial institutions that are parties to our revolving credit facilities if these institutions become capital constrained tighten their lending standards or become insolvent or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from other borrowers within a short period of time they may be unable or unwilling to honor their funding commitments to us which would adversely affect our ability to draw on our revolving credit facilities and over time could negatively impact our ability to consummate acquisitions repay indebtedness as it matures fund capital expenditures or make distributions to our stockholders if our access to capital is limited by these factors or other factors it could negatively impact our ability to acquire properties repay or refinance our indebtedness fund operations or make distributions to our stockholders 

changes affecting the availability of the london interbank offered rate “libor” may have consequences for us that cannot yet reasonably be predicted 

we have outstanding debt hedge agreements and receivable transactions with variable interest rates based on libor the libor benchmark has been subject of national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform in november 2020 ice benchmark administration the administrator of libor with support of the united states federal reserve and the united kingdoms financial conduct authority announced plans to consult on ceasing publication of usd libor on december 31 2021 for the one week and two month usd libor tenors and on june 30 2023 for all other usd libor tenors while this announcement extends the transition period the united states federal reserve concurrently issued a statement advising banks to stop new usd libor issuances by the end of 2021 at this time no consensus exists as to which reference rate or rates or benchmarks may become acceptable alternatives to libor the alternative reference rates committee which was convened by the federal reserve board and the new york fed has identified the second oversight financing rate as the recommended alternative rate for libor these reforms may cause libor to perform differently than in the past and libor may ultimately cease to exist after 2021 while it is not currently possible to determine precisely whether or to what extent the withdrawal and replacement of libor would affect us the implementation of alternative benchmark rates to libor may have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition any new benchmark rate will likely not replicate libor exactly which could impact contracts that terminate after 2023 there is uncertainty about how applicable law the courts or we will address the replacement of libor with alternative rates on agreements that do not include alternative rate fallback provisions in addition any changes to benchmark rates may have an uncertain impact on our cost of funds and our access to the capital markets which could impact our results of operations and cash flows uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes may also adversely affect the trading market for our securities additional financing therefore may be unavailable more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness 

downgrades in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our cost and availability of capital 

we plan to manage the company to maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile but there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the rating agencies could have a material adverse effect on our cost and availability of capital which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity cash flows the tradingredemption price of our securities and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to our equity holders 

increases in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our cost of capital 

an increase in interest rates may increase interest cost on new and existing variable rate debt such increases in the cost of capital could adversely impact our ability to finance operations acquire and develop properties and refinance existing debt additionally increased interest rates may also result in less liquid property markets limiting our ability to sell existing assets 

risks arising from our status as a reit   

we might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a reit   

we intend to operate as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” and believe we have operated and will continue to operate in such a manner if we lose our status as a reit we will face serious income tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for satisfying our obligations and for distribution to our stockholders because 

• we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rates 

• we would be subject to increased state and local taxes and 

• unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions we could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified 

since reit qualification requires us to meet a number of complex requirements it is possible that we may fail to fulfill them and if we do our earnings will be reduced by the amount of us federal and other income taxes owed a reduction in our earnings would affect the amount we could distribute to our stockholders if we do not qualify as a reit we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders since a nonreit is not required to pay dividends to stockholders in order to maintain reit status or avoid an excise tax in addition if we fail to qualify as a reit all distributions to stockholders will continue to be treated as dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits although corporate stockholders may be eligible for the dividends received deduction and individual stockholders may be eligible for taxation at the rates generally applicable to longterm capital gains with respect to distributions 

as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to implement our business strategy and would adversely affect the value of our common stock qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to remain qualified as a reit although we believe that we qualify as a reit we cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as a reit for us federal income tax purposes 

certain subsidiaries might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

we own interests in a number of entities which have elected to be taxed as reits for us federal income tax purposes some of which we consolidate for financial reporting purposes but each of which is treated as a separate reit for federal income tax purposes each a “subsidiary reit” to qualify as a reit each subsidiary reit must independently satisfy all of the reit qualification requirements under the code together with all other rules applicable to reits provided that each subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit our interests in the subsidiary reits will be treated as qualifying real estate assets for purposes of the reit asset tests if a subsidiary reit fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year such subsidiary reit will be subject to federal and state income taxes and may not be able to qualify as a reit for the four subsequent taxable years any such failure could have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reit income and asset tests and thus our ability to qualify as a reit unless we are able to avail ourselves of certain relief provisions   

the 90 annual distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions   

to comply with the 90 distribution requirement applicable to reits and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax we must make distributions to our stockholders although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the reit distribution requirement it is possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90 distribution requirement this may be due to timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses on the one hand and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income on the other hand in addition nondeductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of noncash deductions may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90 distribution requirement in the event that timing differences occur or we deem it appropriate to retain cash we may borrow funds even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings issue additional equity securities although we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so pay taxable stock dividends if possible distribute other property or securities or engage in other transactions intended to enable us to meet the reit distribution requirements this may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations   

our use of trss is limited under the code 

under the code no more than 20 of the value of the gross assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss this limitation may affect our ability to increase the size of our trss’ operations and assets and there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the applicable limitation or that such compliance will not adversely affect our business also our trss may not among other things operate or manage certain health care facilities which may cause us to forgo investments we might otherwise make finally we may be subject to a 100 excise tax on the income derived from certain transactions with our trss that are not on an armslength basis we believe our arrangements with our trss are on armslength terms and intend to continue to operate in a manner that allows us to avoid incurring the 100 excise tax described above but there can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid application of that tax 

the lease of qualified health care properties to a taxable reit subsidiary is subject to special requirements 

we lease certain qualified health care properties to taxable reit subsidiaries or limited liability companies of which the taxable reit subsidiaries are members which lessees contract with managers or related parties to manage the health care operations at these properties the rents from this taxable reit subsidiary lessee structure are treated as qualifying rents from real property if 1 they are paid pursuant to an armslength lease of a qualified health care property with a taxable reit subsidiary and 2 the manager qualifies as an eligible independent contractor as defined in the code if any of these conditions are not satisfied then the rents will not be qualifying rents 

if certain saleleaseback transactions are not characterized by the internal revenue service “irs” as “true leases” we may be subject to adverse tax consequences   

we have purchased certain properties and leased them back to the sellers of such properties and we may enter into similar transactions in the future we intend for any such saleleaseback transaction to be structured in such a manner that the lease will be characterized as a “true lease” thereby allowing us to be treated as the owner of the property for us federal income tax purposes however depending on the terms of any specific transaction the irs might take the position that the transaction is not a “true lease” but is more properly treated in some other manner in the event any saleleaseback transaction is challenged and successfully recharacterized by the irs we would not be entitled to claim the deductions for depreciation and cost recovery generally available to an owner of property furthermore if a saleleaseback transaction were so recharacterized we might fail to satisfy the reit asset tests or income tests and consequently could lose our reit status effective with the year of recharacterization alternatively the amount of our reit taxable income could be recalculated which may cause us to fail to meet the reit annual distribution requirements for a taxable year 

we could be subject to changes in our tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to taxes in the us and foreign jurisdictions because the us maintains a worldwide corporate tax system the foreign and us tax systems are somewhat interdependent longstanding international norms that determine each countrys jurisdiction to tax crossborder international trade are evolving and could reduce the ability of our foreign subsidiaries to deduct for foreign tax purposes the interest they pay on loans from us thereby increasing the foreign tax liability of the subsidiaries it is also possible that foreign countries could increase their withholding taxes on dividends and interest 

our effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates or changes in tax laws or their interpretation we are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the irs and other tax authorities and governmental bodies we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations if we were subject to review or examination by the irs or applicable foreign jurisdiction as the result of any new tax law changes the ultimate determination of which may change our taxes owed for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued or recorded our financial condition operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected 

the present federal income tax treatment of reits may be modified possibly with retroactive effect by legislative judicial or administrative action at any time which could affect the federal income tax treatment of an investment in us the federal income tax rules dealing with us federal income taxation and reits are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process the irs and the us treasury department which results in statutory changes as well as frequent revisions to regulations and interpretations 

we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws in the us or foreign jurisdictions might affect our investors or us revisions in tax laws and interpretations thereof could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a reit as well as the tax considerations relevant to an investment in us could cause us to change our investments and commitments and adversely affect our earnings and cash flow

 item 3 legal proceedings 

from time to time there are various legal proceedings pending against us that arise in the ordinary course of our business management does not believe that the resolution of any of these legal proceedings either individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition further from time to time we are party to certain legal proceedings for which third parties such as tenants operators andor managers are contractually obligated to indemnify defend and hold us harmless in some of these matters the indemnitors have insurance for the potential damages in other matters we are being defended by tenants and other obligated third parties and these indemnitors may not have sufficient insurance assets income or resources to satisfy their defense and indemnification obligations to us the unfavorable resolution of such legal proceedings could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect the indemnitors’ ability to satisfy their respective obligations to us which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition it is management’s opinion that there are currently no such legal proceedings pending that will individually or in the aggregate have such a material adverse effect despite management’s view of the ultimate resolution of these legal proceedings we may have significant legal expenses and costs associated with the defense of such matters further management cannot predict the outcome of these legal proceedings and if management’s expectation regarding such matters is not correct such proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various market risks including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we seek to mitigate the underlying foreign currency exposures with gains and losses on derivative contracts hedging these exposures we seek to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates by matching the terms of new investments with new longterm fixed rate borrowings to the extent possible we may or may not elect to use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate exposure these decisions are principally based on our policy to match our variable rate investments with comparable borrowings but are also based on the general trend in interest rates at the applicable dates and our perception of the future volatility of interest rates this section is presented to provide a discussion of the risks associated with potential fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates for more information see notes 12 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements 

we historically borrow on our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program to acquire construct or make loans relating to health care and seniors housing properties then as market conditions dictate we will issue equity or longterm fixed rate debt to repay the borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program we are subject to risks associated with debt financing including the risk that existing indebtedness may not be refinanced or that the terms of refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of current indebtedness the majority of our borrowings were completed under indentures or contractual agreements that limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur accordingly in the event that we are unable to raise additional equity or borrow money because of these limitations our ability to acquire additional properties may be limited 

a change in interest rates will not affect the interest expense associated with our fixed rate debt interest rate changes however will affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt changes in the interest rate environment upon maturity of this fixed rate debt could have an effect on our future cash flows and earnings depending on whether the debt is replaced with other fixed rate debt variable rate debt or equity or repaid by the sale of assets to illustrate the impact of changes in the interest rate markets we performed a sensitivity analysis on our fixed rate debt instruments whereby we modeled the change in net present values arising from a hypothetical 1 increase in interest rates to determine the instruments’ change in fair value the following table summarizes the analysis performed as of the dates indicated in thousands 



our variable rate debt including our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program is reflected at fair value at december 31 2020 we had 2241909000 outstanding related to our variable rate debt assuming no changes in outstanding balances a 1 increase in interest rates would result in increased annual interest expense of 22420000 at december 31 2019 we had 3470584000 outstanding under our variable rate debt assuming no changes in outstanding balances a 1 increase in interest rates would have resulted in increased annual interest expense of 34706000 

we are subject to currency fluctuations that may from time to time affect our financial condition and results of operations increases or decreases in the value of the canadian dollar or british pounds sterling relative to the us dollar impact the amount of net income we earn from our investments in canada and the united kingdom based solely on our results for the year ended december 31 2020 including the impact of existing hedging arrangements if these exchange rates were to increase or decrease by 10 our net income from these investments would increase or decrease as applicable by less than 3000000 we will continue to mitigate these underlying foreign currency exposures with nonus denominated borrowings and gains and losses on derivative contracts if we increase our international presence through investments in or acquisitions or development of seniors housing and health care properties outside the us we may also decide to transact additional business or borrow funds in currencies other than us dollars canadian dollars or british pounds sterling to illustrate the impact of changes in foreign currency markets we performed a sensitivity analysis on our derivative portfolio whereby we modeled the change in net present values arising from a hypothetical 1 increase in foreign currency exchange rates to determine the instruments’ change in fair value the following table summarizes the results of the analysis performed excluding cross currency hedge activity dollars in thousands

investments 

providing highquality and affordable health care to an aging global population requires vast investments and infrastructure development we invest in seniors housing and health care real estate primarily through acquisitions developments and joint venture partnerships for additional information regarding acquisition and development activity please see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements our portfolio creates opportunities to connect partners across the continuum of care and drive efficiency we seek to diversify our investment portfolio by property type relationship and geographic location in determining whether to invest in a property we focus on the following 1 the experience of the obligor’spartner’s management team 2 the historical and projected financial and operational performance of the property 3 the credit of the obligorpartner 4 the security for any lease or loan 5 the real estate attributes of the building and its location 6 the capital committed to the property by the obligorpartner and 7 the operating fundamentals of the applicable industry 

we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property our asset management process for seniors housing properties generally includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each property review of obligorpartner creditworthiness property inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure real estate taxes letters of credit and other collateral our internal property management division manages and monitors the outpatient medical portfolio with a comprehensive process including review of among other things tenant relations lease expirations the mix of health service providers hospitalhealth system relationships property performance capital improvement needs and market conditions 

investment types   

real property our properties are primarily comprised of land buildings improvements and related rights our triplenet properties are generally leased to operators under longterm operating leases the leases generally have a fixed contractual term of 12 to 15 years and contain one or more five to 15year renewal options certain of our leases also contain purchase options a portion of which could result in the disposition of properties for less than full market value if the options were to be exercised most of our rents are received under triplenet leases requiring the operator to pay rent and all additional charges incurred in the operation of the leased property the tenants are required to repair rebuild and maintain the leased properties substantially all these operating leases are designed with escalating rent structures leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straightline basis over the initial lease period subject to a collectability assessment rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period 

at december 31 2019  approximately 95 of our triplenet properties were subject to master leases a master lease is a lease of multiple properties to one tenant entity under a single lease agreement from time to time we may acquire additional properties that are then leased to the tenant under the master lease the tenant is required to make one monthly payment that represents rent on all the properties that are subject to the master lease typically the master lease tenant can exercise its right to purchase the properties or to renew the master lease only with respect to all leased properties at the same time we believe this bundling feature benefits us because the tenant cannot limit the purchase or renewal to better performing properties and terminate the leasing arrangement with respect to poorer performing properties this spreads our risk among the entire group of properties within the master lease the bundling feature should provide a similar advantage to us if the master lease tenant is in bankruptcy subject to certain restrictions a debtor in bankruptcy has the right to assume or reject its unexpired leases and executory contracts in the context of integrated master leases such as ours our tenants in bankruptcy would be required to assume or reject the master lease as a whole rather than deciding on a property by property basis 

our outpatient medical portfolio is primarily selfmanaged and consists principally of multitenant properties leased to health care providers our leases typically include increasers and some form of operating expense reimbursement by the tenant as of december 31 2019  77 of our portfolio included leases with full pass through 20 with a partial expense reimbursement modified gross and 3 with no expense reimbursement gross our outpatient medical leases are noncancellable operating leases that have a weightedaverage remaining term of seven years at december 31 2019 and are often credit enhanced by security deposits guarantees andor letters of credit 

construction we provide for the construction of properties for tenants primarily as part of longterm operating leases we capitalize certain interest costs associated with funds used for the construction of properties owned by us the amount capitalized is based upon the amount advanced during the construction period using the rate of interest that approximates our companywide cost of financing our interest expense is reduced by the amount capitalized the construction period commences upon funding and terminates upon the earlier of the completion of the applicable property or the end of a specified period during the construction period we advance funds to the tenants in accordance with agreed upon terms and conditions which require among other things periodic site visits by a company representative during the construction period we generally require an additional credit enhancement in the form of payment and performance bonds andor completion guarantees at december 31 2019  we had outstanding construction investments of 507931000 and were committed to provide additional funds of approximately  446633000 to complete construction for investment properties we also provide for construction loans which depending on the terms and conditions could be treated as loans real property or investments in unconsolidated entities 

loans our real estate loans are typically structured to provide us with interest income principal amortization and transaction fees real estate loans consist of mortgage loans and other real estate loans which are primarily collateralized by a first second or third mortgage lien a leasehold mortgage on or an assignment of the partnership interest in the related properties corporate guarantees andor personal guarantees non real estate loans are generally corporate loans with no real estate backing at december 31 2019  we had outstanding loans net of allowances of 607236000 with an interest yield of approximately 80 per annum our yield on loans depends upon a number of factors including the stated interest rate average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments the loans outstanding at december 31 2019 are generally subject to one to 15year terms with principal amortization schedules andor balloon payments of the outstanding principal balances at the end of the term 

investments in unconsolidated entities investments in entities that we do not consolidate but for which we can exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are reported under the equity method of accounting our investments in unconsolidated entities generally represent interests ranging from 10 to 50 in real estate assets under the equity method of accounting our share of the investee’s earnings or losses is included in our consolidated results of operations the initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated entities is based on the amount paid to purchase the entity interest inclusive of transaction costs we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the equity method investment to its carrying value when we determine a decline in the estimated fair value of such an investment below its carrying value is otherthantemporary an impairment is recorded 

in substance real estate additionally we provide loans to third parties for the acquisition development and construction of real estate under these arrangements it is possible that we will participate in the expected residual profits of the project through the sale refinancing or acquisition of the property we evaluate the characteristics of each arrangement including its risks and rewards to determine whether they are more similar to those associated with a loan or an investment in real estate arrangements with characteristics implying real estate joint ventures are treated as in substance real estate investments accounted for using the equity method and are presented as investments in unconsolidated entities we have made loans totaling 165193000 related to seven properties as of december 31 2019 which are classified as in substance real estate investments 

principles of consolidation 

the consolidated financial statements are in conformity with us general accepted accounting principles “us gaap” and include the accounts of our whollyowned subsidiaries and joint venture entities that we control through voting rights or other means all material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation 

at inception of joint venture transactions we identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights “variable interest entities” or “vies” and determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of its operations a vie is broadly defined as an entity where either i the equity investors as a group if any do not have a controlling financial interest or ii the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support we consolidate investments in vies when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary accounting standards codification topic 810 consolidations requires enterprises to perform a qualitative approach to determining whether or not a vie will need to be consolidated this evaluation is based on an enterprise’s ability to direct and influence the activities of a vie that most significantly impact that entity’s economic performance 

for investments in joint ventures us gaap may preclude consolidation by the sole general partner in certain circumstances based on the type of rights held by the limited partners we assess the limited partners’ rights and their impact on our consolidation conclusions and we reassess if there is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights of the limited partners the sole general partner increases or decreases its ownership of limited partnership interests or there is an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding limited partnership interests we similarly evaluate the rights of managing members of limited liability companies 

borrowing policies 

we utilize a combination of debt and equity to fund investments generally we intend to issue unsecured fixedrate public debt with longterm maturities to approximate the maturities on our triplenet leases and investment strategy for shortterm purposes we may borrow on our primary unsecured credit facility or issue commercial paper we replace these borrowings with longterm capital such as senior unsecured notes or common stock when terms are deemed favorable we may invest in properties subject to existing mortgage indebtedness in addition we may obtain secured financing for unleveraged properties in which we have invested or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis in certain agreements with our lenders we are subject to restrictions with respect to secured and unsecured indebtedness 

competition 

we compete with other real estate investment trusts real estate partnerships private equity and hedge fund investors banks insurance companies financeinvestment companies governmentsponsored agencies taxable and taxexempt bond funds health care operators developers and other investors in the acquisition development leasing and financing of health care and seniors housing properties we compete for investments based on a number of factors including relationships certainty of execution investment structures and underwriting criteria our ability to successfully compete is impacted by economic and demographic trends availability of acceptable investment opportunities our ability to negotiate beneficial investment terms availability and cost of capital construction and renovation costs and applicable laws and regulations 

the operatorstenants of our properties compete with properties that provide comparable services in the local markets operatorstenants compete for patients and residents based on a number of factors including quality of care reputation physical appearance of properties location services offered family preferences physicians staff and price we also face competition from other health care facilities for tenants such as physicians and other health care providers that provide comparable facilities and services

certain government regulations 

united states 

health law matters — generally 

typically operators of seniors housing facilities do not receive significant funding from government programs and are largely subject to state laws as opposed to federal laws operators of longtermpostacute care facilities and hospitals do receive significant funding from government programs and these facilities are subject to extensive regulation including federal and state laws covering the type and quality of medical andor nursing care provided ancillary services  eg  respiratory occupational physical and infusion therapies qualifications of the administrative personnel and nursing staff the adequacy of the physical plant and equipment reimbursement and rate setting and operating policies in addition as described below operators of these facilities are subject to extensive laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including but not limited to the federal antikickback statute “aks” the federal stark law “stark law” and the federal false claims act “fca” as well as comparable state laws hospitals physician group practice clinics and other health care providers that operate in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal state and local licensure registration certification and inspection laws regulations and industry standards as well as other conditions of participation in federal and state government programs such as medicare and medicaid further operators of longterm care facilities are required to have in place compliance and ethics programs that meet the requirements of federal laws and regulations our tenants’ failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in among other things loss of 

accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension decertification or exclusion from federal and state health care programs loss of license or closure of the facility see risk factors “the requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid could have a material adverse effect on our obligors’ liquidity financial condition and results of operations which could adversely affect our obligors’ ability to meet their obligations to us” and “our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with federal state local and industryregulated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards could adversely affect such operators’ or tenants’ operations which could adversely affect our operators’ and tenants’ ability to meet their obligations to us” in “item 1a – risk factors” below moreover in light of certain arrangements that welltower may pursue with healthcare entities who are directly subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse and given that certain of our arrangements are structured under the provisions of the reit investment diversification and empowerment act of 2007 ridea certain health care fraud and abuse laws and data privacy laws could apply directly to welltower see risk factor we assume operational and legal risks with respect to our properties managed in ridea structures that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in item 1a  risk factors below 

licensing and certification 

the primary regulations that affect longterm and postacute care facilities are state licensing and registration laws for example certain health care facilities are subject to a variety of licensure and certificate of need “con” laws and regulations where applicable con laws generally require among other requirements that a facility demonstrate the need for 1 constructing a new facility 2 adding beds or expanding an existing facility 3 investing in major capital equipment or adding new services 4 changing the ownership or control of an existing licensed facility or 5 terminating services that have been previously approved through the con process certain state con laws and regulations may restrict the ability of operators to add new properties or expand an existing facility’s size or services in addition con laws may constrain the ability of an operator to transfer responsibility for operating a particular facility to a new operator 

with respect to licensure generally our longtermpostacute care facilities are required to be licensed and certified for participation in medicare medicaid and other federal and state health care programs the failure of our operators to maintain or renew any required license or regulatory approval as well as the failure of our operators to correct serious deficiencies identified in a compliance survey could require those operators to discontinue operations at a property in addition if a property is found to be out of compliance with medicare medicaid or other federal or state health care program conditions of participation the property operator may be excluded from participating in those government health care programs 

reimbursement 

the reimbursement methodologies applied to health care facilities continue to evolve federal and state authorities have considered and implemented and may continue seeking to implement new or modified reimbursement methodologies including valuebased reimbursement methodologies that may negatively impact health care property operations likewise thirdparty payors may continue imposing greater controls on operators including through changes in reimbursement rates and fee structures the impact of any such changes if implemented may result in a material adverse effect on our portfolio no assurance can be given that current revenue sources or levels will be maintained accordingly there can be no assurance that payments under a government health care program are currently or will be in the future sufficient to fully reimburse the property operators for their operating and capital expenses 



under these payment systems that costs will exceed the fixed payments or that payments may be set below the costs to provide certain items and services in addition the hhs office of inspector general has released recommendations to address snf billing practices and medicare payment rates if followed these recommendations regarding snf payment reform may impact our tenants and operators 

 fraud  abuse enforcement 

longtermpostacute care facilities and seniors housing facilities that receive medicaid payments are subject to federal state and local laws regulations and applicable guidance that govern the operations and financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by health care providers certain of these laws such as the aks and stark law prohibit direct or indirect payments of any kind for the purpose of inducing or encouraging the referral of patients for medical products or services reimbursable by government health care programs other government health program laws require providers to furnish only medically necessary services and submit to the government valid and accurate statements for each service our operators and tenants that receive payments from federal health care programs such as medicare and medicaid are subject to substantial financial penalties under the civil monetary penalties act and the fca upon a finding of noncompliance with such laws in addition states may also have separate false claims acts which among other things generally prohibit health care providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payments federal and state fcas contain whistleblower provisions that permit private individuals to bring health care fraud enforcement claims on behalf of the government still other laws require providers to comply with a variety of safety health and other requirements relating to the condition of the licensed property and the quality of care 

provided sanctions for violations of these laws regulations and other applicable guidance may include but are not limited to criminal andor civil penalties and fines loss of licensure immediate termination of government payments exclusion from any government health care program damage assessments and imprisonment in certain circumstances violation of these rules such as those prohibiting abusive and fraudulent behavior with respect to one property may subject other facilities under common control or ownership to sanctions including exclusion from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs as well as other government health care programs in the ordinary course of its business a property operator is regularly subjected to inquiries investigations and audits by the federal and state agencies that oversee these laws and regulations 

prosecutions investigations or whistleblower actions could have a material adverse effect on a property operator’s liquidity financial condition and operations which could adversely affect the ability of the operator to meet its financial obligations to us in addition government investigations and enforcement actions brought against the health care industry have increased dramatically over the past several years and are expected to continue the costs for an operator of a health care property associated with both defending such enforcement actions and the undertakings in settling these actions can be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its obligations to us in addition welltower could potentially be directly subject to these health care fraud and abuse laws as well as potential investigation or enforcement as a result of our rideastructured arrangements and certain collaboration or other arrangements we may pursue with stakeholders who are directly subject to these laws 

federal and state data privacy and security laws

in the uk care home services are principally regulated by the health and social care act 2008 as amended and other regulations this legislation subjects service providers to a number of legally binding “fundamental standards” and requires amongst other things that all persons carrying out “regulated activities” in the uk and the managers of such persons be registered providers of care home services are also subject as data controllers to laws governing their use of personal data including in relation to their employees clients and recipients of their services these laws currently take the form of the uk’s data protection act 2018 and the european union’s “eu” general data protection regulation “gdpr” among other laws the data protection act and the gdpr impose a significant number of obligations on controllers with the potential for fines of up to 4 of annual worldwide turnover or €20 million whichever is greater entities incorporated in or carrying on a business in the uk as well as individuals residing in the uk are also subject to the uk bribery act 2010 the uk has national minimum wage legislation with a maximum fine for nonpayment of £20000 per worker and employers who fail to pay will be banned from being a company director for up to 15 years the national minimum wage is set to increase in april 2020 

the uk exited from the eu “brexit” on january 31 2020 uk there will be a transition period until the end of 2020 during which time the uk will continue to abide by all eu rules while it seeks to negotiate its relationship with the eu which would include inter alia the regulation and import of medicines further the impact of brexit on the health and care workforce will depend on future migration policy and the barriers or incentives to live in the uk until the terms of the withdrawal are finally determined we cannot predict the impact of brexit on uk regulations

general 

we elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust a “reit” commencing with our first taxable year we intend to continue to operate in such a manner as to qualify as a reit but there is no guarantee that we will qualify or remain qualified as a reit for subsequent years qualification and taxation as a reit depends upon our ability to meet a variety of qualification tests imposed under us federal income tax law with respect to our income assets distributions and share ownership as discussed below under “qualification as a reit” there can be no assurance that we will qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

in any year in which we qualify as a reit in general we will not be subject to us federal income tax on that portion of our reit taxable income or capital gain that is distributed to stockholders we may however be subject to tax at normal corporate rates on any taxable income or capital gain not distributed if we elect to retain and pay income tax on our net capital gain stockholders would be taxed on their proportionate share of our undistributed net capital gain and would receive a refundable credit for their share of any taxes paid by us on such gain 

despite the reit election we may be subject to us federal income and excise tax as follows 



 if we acquire any assets from a corporation which is or has been a “c” corporation in a carryover basis transaction including where a “c” corporation elects reit status we could be liable for specified liabilities that are inherited from the “c” corporation a “c” corporation is generally defined as a corporation that is required to pay full corporate level us federal income tax if we recognize gain on the disposition of the assets during the fiveyear period beginning on the date on which the assets were acquired by us then to the extent of the assets’ “builtin gain” eg the excess of the fair market value of the asset over the adjusted tax basis of the asset in each case determined as of the beginning of the fiveyear period we will be subject to tax on the gain at the highest regular corporate rate applicable the results described in this paragraph with respect to the recognition of builtin gain assume that the “c” corporation did not make and was not treated as making an election to treat the builtin gain assets as sold to an unrelated party for those properties that are subject to the builtin gains tax the potential amount of builtin gains tax will be an additional factor when considering a possible sale of the properties within the fiveyear period beginning on the date on which the properties were acquired by us see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the builtin gains tax 

qualification as a reit 

a reit is defined as a corporation trust or association 

 taxable year 

 its first taxable year directly indirectly or constructively by or for five or fewer individuals which includes certain 

entities the “five or fewer requirement” and 

 conditions 1 to 4 inclusive must be met during the entire taxable year and condition 5 must be met during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months for purposes of conditions 5 and 6 pension funds and certain other taxexempt entities are treated as individuals subject to a “lookthrough” exception in the case of condition 6 

based on publicly available information we believe we have satisfied the share ownership requirements set forth in 5 and 6 above in addition article vi of our bylaws provides for restrictions regarding ownership and transfer of shares these restrictions are intended to assist us in continuing to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in 5 and 6 above but may not ensure that we will in all cases be able to satisfy such requirements 

we have complied with and will continue to comply with regulatory rules to send annual letters to certain of our stockholders requesting information regarding the actual ownership of our stock if despite sending the annual letters we do not know or after exercising reasonable diligence would not have known whether we failed to meet the five or fewer requirement we will be treated as having met the five or fewer requirement if we fail to comply with these regulatory rules we will be subject to a monetary penalty if our failure to comply were due to intentional disregard of the requirement the penalty would be increased however if our failure to comply were due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect no penalty would be imposed 

we may own a number of properties through wholly owned subsidiaries a corporation will qualify as a “qualified reit subsidiary” if 100 of its stock is owned by a reit and the reit does not elect to treat the subsidiary as a taxable reit subsidiary a “qualified reit subsidiary” will not be treated as a separate corporation for us federal income tax purposes and all assets liabilities and items of income deductions and credits of a “qualified reit subsidiary” will be treated as assets liabilities and items as the case may be of the reit for us federal income tax purposes a “qualified reit subsidiary” is not subject to us federal income tax and our ownership of the voting stock of a qualified reit subsidiary will not violate the restrictions against ownership of securities of any one issuer which constitute more than 10 of the value or total voting power of such issuer or more than 5 of the value of our total assets as described below under “ asset tests” 

if we invest in an entity treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes we will be deemed to own a proportionate share of the entity’s assets likewise we will be treated as receiving our share of the income and loss of the entity and the gross income will retain the same character in our hands as it has in the hands of the entity these “lookthrough” rules apply for purposes of the income tests and assets tests described below 

the deduction of business interest is limited to 30 of adjusted taxable income which may limit the deductibility of interest expense by us our taxable reit subsidiaries or our joint venture and partnership arrangements a “real property trade or business” may irrevocably elect out of the applicability of the limitation but if it does so it must use the less favorable alternative depreciation system to depreciate real property used in the trade or business proposed regulations provide guidance on how to allocate interest deductions among multiple trades or businesses and contain special rules including a safe harbor regarding the allocation of a reit’s interest deductions to a “real property trade or business” 

income tests there are two separate percentage tests relating to our sources of gross income that we must satisfy each taxable year 

 income from hedging and foreign currency transactions is excluded from the 95 and 75 gross income tests if certain requirements are met but otherwise will constitute gross income which does not qualify under the 95 or 75 gross income tests 

rents received by us will qualify as “rents from real property” for purposes of satisfying the gross income tests for a reit only if several conditions are met 

 a reit is permitted to render a de minimis amount of impermissible services to tenants and still treat amounts received with respect to that property as rent from real property the amount received or accrued by the reit during the taxable year for the impermissible services with respect to a property may not exceed 1 of all amounts received or accrued by the reit directly or indirectly from the property the amount received for any service or management operation for this purpose shall be deemed to be not less than 150 of the direct cost of the reit in furnishing or rendering the service or providing the management or operation furthermore impermissible services may be furnished to tenants by a taxable reit subsidiary subject to certain conditions which would permit us to still treat rents received with respect to the property as rent from real property 

the term “interest” generally does not include any amount if the determination of the amount depends in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person although an amount generally will not be excluded from the term “interest” solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage of receipts or sales 

if we fail to satisfy one or both of the 75 or 95 gross income tests for any taxable year we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for such year if we are eligible for certain relief provisions provided by the internal revenue code these relief provisions generally will be available if 1 following our identification of the failure we file a schedule for such taxable year describing each item of our gross income and 2 the failure to meet such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect it is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions if these relief provisions apply a 100 tax is imposed on an amount equal to 1 the gross income attributable to i 75 of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75 income test and ii 95 of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 95 income test multiplied by 2 a fraction intended to reflect our profitability the secretary of the treasury is given broad authority to determine whether particular items of income or gain qualify under the 75 and 95 gross income tests and to exclude items from the measure of gross income for such purposes 

asset tests   within 30 days after the close of each quarter of our taxable year we must also satisfy several tests relating to the nature and diversification of our assets determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles at least 75 of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets including interests in real property interests in mortgages on real property or on interests in real property shares in other reits and debt instruments issued by publicly offered reits cash cash items including receivables arising in the ordinary course of our operation government securities and qualified temporary investments although the remaining 25 of our assets generally may be invested without restriction we are prohibited from owning securities representing more than 10 of either the vote the “10 vote test” or value the “10 value test” of the outstanding securities of any issuer other than a qualified reit subsidiary another reit or a taxable reit subsidiary further no more than 20 of our total assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries the “20 asset test” and no more than 5 of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities of any nongovernmental issuer other than a qualified reit subsidiary the “5 asset test” another reit or a taxable reit subsidiary each of the 10 vote test the 10 value test and the 20 and 5 asset tests must be satisfied at the end of each quarter there are special rules which provide relief if the valuerelated tests are not satisfied due to changes in the value of the assets of a reit 

certain items are excluded from the 10 value test including 1 straight debt securities meeting certain requirements 2 any loan to an individual or an estate 3 any rental agreement described in section 467 of the internal revenue code other than with a “related person” 4 any obligation to pay rents from real property 5 certain securities issued by a state or any subdivision thereof the district of columbia a foreign government or any political subdivision thereof or the commonwealth of puerto rico 6 any security issued by a reit and 7 any other arrangement that as determined by the secretary of the treasury is excepted from the definition of security “excluded securities” if a reit or its taxable reit subsidiary holds 1 straight debt securities of a corporate or partnership issuer and 2 securities of such issuer that are not excluded securities and have an aggregate value greater than 1 of such issuer’s outstanding securities the straight debt securities will be included in the 10 value test 

a reit’s interest as a partner in a partnership is not treated as a security for purposes of applying the 10 value test to securities issued by the partnership further any debt instrument issued by a partnership that is not an excluded security will not be a security for purposes of applying the 10 value test 1 to the extent of the reit’s interest as a partner in the partnership or 2 if at least 75 of the partnership’s gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions would qualify for the 75 gross income test for purposes of the 10 value test a reit’s interest in a partnership’s assets is determined by the reit’s proportionate interest in any securities issued by the partnership other than the excluded securities described in the preceding paragraph 

if a reit or its “qualified business unit” uses a foreign currency as its functional currency the term “cash” includes such foreign currency but only to the extent such foreign currency is i held for use in the normal course of the activities of the reit or “qualified business unit” which give rise to items of income or gain that are included in the 95 and 75 gross income tests or are directly related to acquiring or holding assets qualifying under the 75 asset test and ii not held in connection with dealing or engaging in substantial and regular trading in securities 

with respect to corrections of failures as to violations of the 10 vote test the 10 value test or the 5 asset test a reit may avoid disqualification as a reit by disposing of sufficient assets to cure a violation due to the ownership of assets that do not exceed the lesser of 1 of the reit’s assets at the end of the relevant quarter or 10000000 provided that the disposition occurs within six months following the last day of the quarter in which the reit first identified the assets for violations of any of the reit asset tests due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that exceed the thresholds described in the preceding sentence a reit can avoid disqualification as a reit after the close of a taxable quarter by taking certain steps including disposition of sufficient assets within the six month period described above to meet the applicable asset test paying a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets during the period of time that the assets were held as nonqualifying assets and filing a schedule with the internal revenue service that describes the nonqualifying assets 

investments in taxable reit subsidiaries reits may own more than 10 of the voting power and value of securities in taxable reit subsidiaries unlike a qualified reit subsidiary other disregarded entity or partnership the income and assets of a taxable reit subsidiary are not attributable to the reit for purposes of satisfying the income and asset ownership requirements applicable to reit qualification we and any taxable corporate entity in which we own an interest are allowed to jointly elect to treat such entity as a “taxable reit subsidiary” 

certain of our subsidiaries have elected taxable reit subsidiary status taxable reit subsidiaries are subject to full corporate level us federal taxation on their earnings but are permitted to engage in certain types of activities that cannot be performed directly by reits without jeopardizing their reit status our taxable reit subsidiaries will attempt to minimize the amount of these taxes but there can be no assurance whether or the extent to which measures taken to minimize taxes will be successful to the extent our taxable reit subsidiaries are required to pay us federal state or local taxes the cash available for distribution as dividends to us from our taxable reit subsidiaries will be reduced 

the internal revenue service may redetermine amounts from transactions between a reit and its taxable reit subsidiary where there is a lack of arm’slength dealing between the parties any taxable income allocated to or deductible expenses allocated away from a taxable reit subsidiary would increase its tax liability further certain amounts from certain transactions involving a reit and its taxable reit subsidiaries could be subject to a 100 tax if not conducted on an arm’s length basis additional taxable reit subsidiary elections may be made in the future for additional entities in which we obtain an interest 

annual distribution requirements in order to avoid being taxed as a regular corporation we are required to make distributions other than capital gain distributions to our stockholders which qualify for the dividends paid deduction in an amount at least equal to 1 the sum of i 90 of our “reit taxable income” computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain and ii 90 of the aftertax net income if any from foreclosure property minus 2 a portion of certain items of noncash income these distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for that year and if paid on or before the first regular distribution payment after such declaration prior to 2014 with respect to all reits the amount distributed could not be preferential this means that every stockholder of the class of stock to which a distribution is made must be treated the same as every other stockholder of that class and no class of stock may be treated otherwise than in accordance with its dividend rights as a class the “preferential dividend rule” beginning in tax years after 2014 the preferential dividend rule no longer applies to publicly offered reits however the rule is still applicable to other entities taxed as reits which would include several of our subsidiaries to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our “reit taxable income” as adjusted we will be subject to tax on the undistributed amount at regular corporate tax rates as discussed above we may be subject to an excise tax if we fail to meet certain other distribution requirements we believe we have satisfied the annual distribution requirements for the year of our initial reit election and each year thereafter through the year ended december 31 2019 although we intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy these annual distribution requirements for subsequent years economic market legal tax or other factors could limit our ability to meet those requirements see “item 1a  risk factors” 

it is also possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90 distribution requirement or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation due to among other things 1 timing differences between i the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses and ii the inclusion of income and deduction of expenses in arriving at our taxable income or 2 the payment of severance benefits that may not be deductible to us in the event that timing differences occur we may find it necessary to arrange for borrowings or if possible pay dividends in the form of taxable stock dividends in order to meet the distribution requirement 

under certain circumstances including in the event of a deficiency determined by the internal revenue service we may be able to rectify a resulting failure to meet the distribution requirement for a year by paying “deficiency dividends” to stockholders in a later year which may be included in our deduction for distributions paid for the earlier year thus we may be able to avoid being disqualified as a reit andor taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends however we will be required to pay applicable penalties and interest based upon the amount of any deduction taken for deficiency dividend distributions 

failure to qualify as a reit 

if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to us federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates distributions to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify as a reit will not be deductible nor will any particular amount of distributions be required to be made in any year all distributions to stockholders will be taxable as dividends to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these distributions and subject to certain limitations will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporate stockholders unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions we also will be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to statutory relief failure to qualify for even one year could result in our need to incur indebtedness or liquidate investments in order to pay potentially significant resulting tax liabilities 

in addition to the relief described above under “income tests” and “asset tests” relief is available in the event that we violate a provision of the internal revenue code that would result in our failure to qualify as a reit if 1 the violation is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect 2 we pay a penalty of 50000 for each failure to satisfy the provision and 3 the violation does not include a violation described under “income tests” or “asset tests” above it is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions 

us federal income taxation of holders of our stock 

treatment of taxable us stockholders the following summary applies to you only if you are a “us stockholder” a “us stockholder” is a holder of shares of stock who for us federal income tax purposes is 

 so long as we qualify for taxation as a reit distributions on shares of our stock made out of the current or accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these distributions and not designated as capital gain dividends will be taxable as dividends for us federal income tax purposes none of these distributions will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for us corporate stockholders 

generally the current maximum marginal rate of tax payable by individuals on dividends received from corporations that are subject to a corporate level of tax is 20 except in limited circumstances this tax rate will not apply to dividends paid to you by us on our shares because generally we are not subject to us federal income tax on the portion of our reit taxable income or capital gains distributed to our stockholders the reduced maximum us federal income tax rate will apply to that portion if any of dividends received by you with respect to our shares that are attributable to 1 dividends received by us from nonreit corporations or other taxable reit subsidiaries 2 income from the prior year with respect to which we were required to pay us federal corporate income tax during the prior year if for example we did not distribute 100 of our reit taxable income for the prior year or 3 the amount of any earnings and profits distributed by us and accumulated in a nonreit year 

although the preferential 20 rate on qualified dividends is generally not applicable to dividends to our shareholders the internal revenue code provides for a deduction from income for individuals trusts and estates for 20 of taxable reit dividends not eligible for the preferential rate excluding capital gain dividends this deduction is not taken into account for purposes of determining the 38 tax on net investment income described below and unlike the preferential rate expires after 2025 

distributions that are designated as capital gain dividends will be taxed as longterm capital gains to the extent they do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year without regard to the period for which you held our stock however if you are a corporation you may be required to treat a portion of some capital gain dividends as ordinary income 

if we elect to retain and pay income tax on any net capital gain and designate such amount in a timely notice to you you would include in income as longterm capital gain your proportionate share of this net capital gain you would also receive a refundable tax credit for your proportionate share of the tax paid by us on such retained capital gains and you would have an increase in the basis of your shares of our stock in an amount equal to your includable capital gains less your share of the tax deemed paid 

you may not include in your us federal income tax return any of our net operating losses or capital losses us federal income tax rules may also require that certain minimum tax adjustments and preferences be apportioned to you in addition any distribution declared by us in october november or december of any year on a specified date in any such month shall be treated as both paid by us and received by you on december 31 of that year provided that the distribution is actually paid by us no later than january 31 of the following year 

we will be treated as having sufficient earnings and profits to treat as a dividend any distribution up to the amount required to be distributed in order to avoid imposition of the 4 excise tax discussed under “general” and “qualification as a reit  annual distribution requirements” above as a result you may be required to treat as taxable dividends certain distributions that would otherwise result in a taxfree return of capital moreover any “deficiency dividend” will be treated as a dividend an ordinary dividend or a capital gain dividend as the case may be regardless of our earnings and profits any other distributions in excess of current or accumulated earnings and profits will generally not be taxable to you to the extent these distributions do not exceed the adjusted tax basis of your shares of our stock you will be required to reduce the tax basis of your shares of our stock by the amount of these distributions until the basis has been reduced to zero after which these distributions will be taxable as capital gain if the shares of our stock are held as capital assets the tax basis as so reduced will be used in computing the capital gain or 

loss if any realized upon the sale of the shares of our stock any loss upon a sale or exchange of shares of our stock which were held for six months or less after application of certain holding period rules will generally be treated as a longterm capital loss to the extent you previously received capital gain distributions with respect to these shares of our stock 

upon the sale or exchange of any shares of our stock to or with a person other than us or a sale or exchange of all shares of our stock whether actually or constructively owned with us you will generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your adjusted tax basis in these shares of our stock this gain or loss will be capital gain or loss if you held these shares of our stock as a capital asset 

if we redeem any of your shares in us the treatment can only be determined on the basis of particular facts at the time of redemption in general you will recognize gain or loss as opposed to dividend income equal to the difference between the amount received by you in the redemption and your adjusted tax basis in your shares redeemed if such redemption 1 results in a “complete termination” of your interest in all classes of our equity securities 2 is a “substantially disproportionate redemption” or 3 is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” with respect to you in applying these tests you must take into account your ownership of all classes of our equity securities eg common stock preferred stock depositary shares and warrants you also must take into account any equity securities that are considered to be constructively owned by you 

if as a result of a redemption by us of your shares you no longer own either actually or constructively any of our equity securities or only own actually and constructively an insubstantial percentage of our equity securities then it is probable that the redemption of your shares would be considered “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” and thus would result in gain or loss to you however whether a distribution is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” depends on all of the facts and circumstances and if you rely on any of these tests at the time of redemption you should consult your tax advisor to determine their application to the particular situation 

generally if the redemption does not meet the tests described above then the proceeds received by you from the redemption of your shares will be treated as a distribution taxable as a dividend to the extent of the allocable portion of current or accumulated earnings and profits if the redemption is taxed as a dividend your adjusted tax basis in the redeemed shares will be transferred to any other shareholdings in us that you own if you own no other shareholdings in us under certain circumstances such basis may be transferred to a related person or it may be lost entirely 

gain from the sale or exchange of our shares held for more than one year is generally taxed at a maximum longterm capital gain rate of 20 in the case of stockholders who are individuals and 21 in the case of stockholders that are corporations pursuant to internal revenue service guidance we may classify portions of our capital gain dividends as eligible for specific treatment provided under the internal revenue code which depending on the nature of the capital gains may result in taxation of such portions at rates of either 20 or 25 capital losses recognized by a stockholder upon the disposition of our shares held for more than one year at the time of disposition will be considered longterm capital losses the deduction for capital losses is subject to limitations 

an additional tax of 38 generally will be imposed on the “net investment income” of us stockholders who meet certain requirements and are individuals estates or certain trusts among other items “net investment income” generally includes gross income from dividends and net gain attributable to the disposition of certain property such as shares of our common stock or warrants in the case of individuals this tax will only apply to the extent such individual’s modified adjusted gross income exceeds 200000 250000 for married couples filing a joint return and surviving spouses and 125000 for married individuals filing a separate return us stockholders should consult their tax advisors regarding the possible applicability of this additional tax in their particular circumstances 

treatment of taxexempt us stockholders taxexempt entities including qualified employee pension and profit sharing trusts and individual retirement accounts “exempt organizations” generally are exempt from us federal income taxation however they are subject to taxation on their unrelated business taxable income “ubti” the internal revenue service has issued a published revenue ruling that dividend distributions from a reit to an exempt employee pension trust do not constitute ubti provided that the shares of the reit are not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business of the exempt employee pension trust based on this ruling amounts distributed by us to exempt organizations generally should not constitute ubti however if an exempt organization finances its acquisition of the shares of our stock with debt a portion of its income from us will constitute ubti pursuant to the “debt financed property” rules likewise a portion of the exempt organization’s income from us would constitute ubti if we held a residual interest in a real estate mortgage investment conduit a taxexempt us stockholder that is subject to tax on its ubti will be required to segregate its taxable income and loss for each unrelated trade or business activity for purposes of determining its ubti 

backup withholding and information reporting under certain circumstances you may be subject to backup withholding at applicable rates on payments made with respect to or cash proceeds of a sale or exchange of shares of our stock backup withholding will apply only if you 1 fail to provide a correct taxpayer identification number which if you are an individual is ordinarily your social security number 2 furnish an incorrect taxpayer identification number 3 are notified by the internal revenue service that you have failed to properly report payments of interest or dividends or 4 fail to certify under penalties of perjury 

that you have furnished a correct taxpayer identification number and that the internal revenue service has not notified you that you are subject to backup withholding 

backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients such as corporations and taxexempt organizations you should consult with a tax advisor regarding qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining an exemption backup withholding is not an additional tax rather the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a stockholder will be allowed as a credit against such stockholder’s us federal income tax liability and may entitle such stockholder to a refund provided that the required information is provided to the internal revenue service 

taxation of foreign stockholders the following summary applies to you only if you are a foreign person a “foreign person” is a holder of shares of stock who for us federal income tax purposes is not a us stockholder the us federal taxation of foreign persons is a highly complex matter that may be affected by many considerations

potential legislation or other actions affecting tax consequences 

current and prospective securities holders should recognize that the present us federal income tax treatment of an investment in us may be modified by legislative judicial or administrative action at any time and that any such action may affect investments and commitments previously made the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the internal revenue service and the department of the treasury resulting in revisions of regulations and revised interpretations of established concepts as well as statutory changes revisions in us federal tax laws and interpretations of these laws could adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in us 

state local and foreign taxes 

we and holders of our debt and equity securities may be subject to state local or foreign taxation in various jurisdictions including those in which we or they transact business own property or reside it should be noted that we own properties located in a number of state local and foreign jurisdictions and may be required to file tax returns in some or all of those jurisdictions the state local or foreign tax treatment of us and holders of our debt and equity securities may not conform to the us federal income tax consequences discussed above consequently you are urged to consult your advisor regarding the application and effect of state local and foreign tax laws with respect to any investment in our securities 

because the us generally maintains a worldwide corporate tax system the foreign and us tax systems are somewhat interdependent longstanding international tax norms that determine each country’s jurisdiction to tax crossborder international trade are evolving and could reduce the ability of our foreign subsidiaries to deduct for foreign tax purposes the interest they pay on loans from the company thereby increasing the foreign tax liability of the subsidiaries it is also possible that foreign countries could increase their withholding taxes on dividends and interest given the unpredictability of these possible changes and their potential interdependency it is very difficult to assess the overall effect of such potential tax changes on our earnings and cash flow but such changes could adversely impact our financial results

 item 1a risk factors 

this section highlights significant factors events and uncertainties that could create risk with an investment in our securities the events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could in circumstances we may not be able to accurately predict recognize or control have a material adverse effect on our business growth reputation prospects financial condition operating results cash flows liquidity ability to pay dividends and stock price these risk factors do not identify all risks that we face our operations could also be affected by factors events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations we group these risk factors into three categories 



risks arising from our business 

our investments in and acquisitions of health care and seniors housing properties may be unsuccessful or fail to meet our expectations   

we are exposed to the risk that some of our acquisitions may not prove to be successful we could encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired properties including contingent liabilities and acquired properties might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business if we agree to provide construction funding to an operatortenant and the project is not completed we may need to take steps to ensure completion of the project such expenditures may negatively affect our results of operations investments in and acquisitions of seniors housing and health care properties entail risks associated with real estate investments generally including risks that the investment will not achieve expected returns that the cost estimates for necessary property improvements will prove inaccurate or that the tenant operator or manager will fail to meet performance expectations furthermore there can be no assurance that our anticipated acquisitions and investments the completion of which is subject to various conditions will be consummated in accordance with anticipated timing on anticipated terms or at all we may be unable to obtain or assume financing for acquisitions on favorable terms or at all health care properties are often highly customizable and the development or redevelopment of such properties may require costly tenantspecific improvements we also may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties into our existing operations and this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition acquired properties may be located in new markets either within or outside the united states where we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy lack of business relationships in the area costs associated with opening a new regional office and unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures as a result we cannot assure you that we will achieve the economic benefit we expect from acquisitions investment development and redevelopment opportunities 

acquired properties may expose us to unknown liability 

we may acquire properties or invest in joint ventures that own properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse or with only limited recourse against the prior owners or other third parties with respect to unknown liabilities as a result if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties we might have to pay substantial sums to settle or contest it which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow unknown liabilities with respect to acquired properties might include liabilities for clean up of undisclosed environmental contamination claims by tenants vendors or other persons against the former owners of the properties liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business and claims for indemnification by general partners directors and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties 

competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties 

we may face competition for acquisition opportunities from other wellcapitalized investors including publicly traded and privately held reits private real estate funds domestic and foreign financial institutions life insurance companies sovereign wealth funds pension trusts partnerships and individual investors this competition may adversely affect us by subjecting us to the following risks we may be unable to acquire a desired property because of competition from other wellcapitalized real estate investors and even if we are able to acquire a desired property competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price 

our investments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by our lack of exclusive control over these investments our partners’ insolvency or failure to meet their obligations and disputes between us and our partners   

we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into partnerships or joint ventures with other persons or entities joint venture investments involve risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership including the possibility that our partner might become insolvent refuse to make capital contributions when due or otherwise fail to meet its obligations which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments that our partner might at any time have economic or other business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our interests or goals that we could become engaged in a dispute with our partner which could require us to expend additional resources to resolve such dispute and could have an adverse impact on the operations and profitability of the joint venture that our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests and that our joint venture partners may be structured differently than us for tax purposes which could create conflicts of interest and risks to our reit status in some instances we andor our partner may have the right to trigger a buysell put right or forced sale arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest acquire our partner’s interest or sell the underlying asset at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction our ability to acquire our partner’s interest may be limited if we do not have sufficient cash available borrowing capacity or other capital resources in such event we may be forced to sell our interest in the joint venture when we would otherwise prefer to retain it on the other hand our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted and the market for our interest may be limited andor valued lower than fair market value joint ventures may require us to share decisionmaking authority with our partners which could limit our ability to control the properties in the joint ventures even when we have a controlling interest certain major decisions may require partner approval such as the sale acquisition or financing of a property 

we are exposed to operational risks with respect to our seniors housing operating properties that could adversely affect our revenue and operations 

we are exposed to various operational risks with respect to our seniors housing operating properties that may increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to generate revenues these risks include fluctuations in occupancy medicare and medicaid reimbursement if applicable and private pay rates economic conditions competition federal state local and industryregulated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards the availability and increases in cost of general and professional liability insurance coverage state regulation and rights of residents related to entrance fees and the availability and increases in the cost of labor as a result of unionization or otherwise any one or a combination of these factors may adversely affect our revenue and operations 

we assume operational and legal risks with respect to our properties managed in ridea structures that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we have entered into various joint ventures that were structured under the provisions of the reit investment diversification and empowerment act of 2007 “ridea” which permits reits to own or partially own “qualified health care properties” in a structure through which we can participate directly in the cash flow of the properties’ operations as compared to receiving only contractual rent payments in compliance with reit requirements a “qualified health care property” includes real property and any personal property that is or is necessary or incidental to the use of a hospital nursing facility assisted living facility congregate care facility qualified continuing care facility or other licensed facility which extends medical or nursing or ancillary services to patients 

under a ridea structure we are required to rely on our operator to manage and operate the property including complying with laws and providing resident care however as the owner of the property under a ridea structure we are responsible for operational and legal risks and liabilities of the property including but not limited to those relating to employment matters of our operators compliance with health care fraud and abuse and other laws governmental reimbursement matters compliance with federal state local and industryrelated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards and litigation involving our properties or residentspatients even though we have limited ability to control or influence our operators’ management of these risks further our taxable reit subsidiary “trs” is generally required to hold the applicable health care license and enroll in the applicable government health care programs eg medicare and medicaid which subjects us to potential liability under various health care regulatory laws penalties for failure to comply with applicable laws may include loss or suspension of licenses and certificates of need certification or accreditation exclusion from government health care programs eg medicare and medicaid administrative sanctions and civil monetary penalties although we have some general oversight approval rights and the right to review operational and financial reporting information our operators are ultimately in control of the daytoday business of the property including clinical decisionmaking we rely on them to operate the properties in compliance with a manner that complies with applicable law 

decreases in our operators’ revenues or increases in our operators’ expenses could affect our operators’ ability to make payments to us 

we have very limited control over the success or failure of our operators businesses and at any time an operator may experience a downturn in its business that weakens its financial condition our operators’ revenues are primarily driven by occupancy private pay rates and medicare and medicaid reimbursement if applicable expenses for these facilities are primarily driven by the costs of labor food utilities taxes insurance and rent or debt service revenues from government reimbursement have and may continue to come under pressure due to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls operating costs continue to increase for our operators to the extent that any decrease in revenues andor any increase in operating expenses result in a property not generating enough cash to make payments to us the credit of our operator and the value of other collateral would have to be relied upon to the extent the value of such property is reduced we may need to record an impairment for such asset furthermore if we determine to dispose of an underperforming property such sale may result in a loss any such impairment or loss on sale would negatively affect our financial results these risks are magnified where we lease multiple properties to a single operator under a master lease as an operator failure or default under a master lease would expose us to these risks across multiple properties although our lease agreements give us the right to exercise certain remedies in the event of default on the obligations owing to us we may determine not to do so if we believe that enforcement of our rights would be more detrimental to our business than seeking alternative approaches 

increased competition and oversupply may affect our operators’ ability to meet their obligations to us   

the operators of our properties compete on a local and regional basis with operators of properties and other health care providers that provide comparable services for residents and patients including on the basis of the scope and quality of care and services provided reputation and financial condition physical appearance of the properties price and location our operators are expected to encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to attract residents or expand their businesses in addition we expect that there will continue to be a more than adequate inventory of seniors housing facilities we cannot be certain that the operators of all of our facilities will be able to achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to 

meet all of their obligations to us if our operators cannot compete effectively or if there is an oversupply of facilities their financial performance and ability to meet their obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our financial results   

a severe cold and flu season epidemics or any other widespread illnesses could adversely affect the occupancy of our seniors housing operating and triplenet properties 

our revenues and our operators’ revenues are dependent on occupancy it is impossible to predict the severity of the cold and flu season or the occurrence of epidemics or any other widespread illnesses the occupancy of our seniors housing operating and triplenet properties could significantly decrease in the event of a severe cold and flu season an epidemic or any other widespread illness such a decrease could affect the operating income of our seniors housing operating properties and the ability of our triplenet operators to make payments to us in addition a flu pandemic could significantly increase the cost burdens faced by our operators including if they are required to implement quarantines for residents and adversely affect their ability to meet their obligations to us which would have a material adverse effect on our financial results   

the insolvency or bankruptcy of our tenants operators borrowers managers and other obligors may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition   

we are exposed to the risk that our tenants operators borrowers managers or other obligors may not be able to meet the rent principal and interest or other payments due us which may result in a tenant operator borrower manager or other obligor bankruptcy or insolvency or that a tenant operator borrower manager or other obligor might become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings for other reasons although our operating lease agreements provide us with the right to evict a tenant demand immediate payment of rent and exercise other remedies and our loans provide us with the right to terminate any funding obligation demand immediate repayment of principal and unpaid interest foreclose on the collateral and exercise other remedies the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization a tenant operator borrower manager or other obligor in bankruptcy or subject to insolvency proceedings may be able to limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent in the case of a lease or to receive unpaid principal and interest in the case of a loan and to exercise other rights and remedies in addition if a lease is rejected in a tenant bankruptcy our claim against the tenant may be limited by applicable provisions of the bankruptcy law we may be required to fund certain expenses eg real estate taxes and maintenance to preserve the value of an investment property avoid the imposition of liens on a property andor transition a property to a new tenant in some instances we have terminated our lease with a tenant and relet the property to another tenant in some of those situations we have provided working capital loans to and limited indemnification of the new obligor if we cannot transition a leased property to a new tenant we may take possession of that property which may expose us to certain successor liabilities publicity about the operators financial condition and insolvency proceedings may also negatively impact their and our reputations decreasing customer demand and revenues should such events occur our revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely affected 

we may not be able to timely reinvest our sale proceeds on terms acceptable to us   

from time to time we will have cash available from the proceeds of sales of our securities principal payments on our loans receivable or the sale of properties including nonelective dispositions under the terms of master leases or similar financial support arrangements in order to maintain current revenues and continue generating attractive returns we expect to reinvest these proceeds in a timely manner we compete for real estate investments with a broad variety of potential investors including other health care reits real estate partnerships health care providers health care lenders and other investors including developers banks insurance companies pension funds governmentsponsored entities and private equity firms some of whom may have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do this competition for attractive investments may negatively affect our ability to make timely investments on terms acceptable to us   

the properties managed by sunrise senior living llc “sunrise” account for a significant portion of our revenues and net operating income and any adverse developments in its business or financial condition could adversely affect us 

as of december 31 2019  sunrise managed 165 of our seniors housing operating properties these properties account for a significant portion of our revenues and net operating income although we have various rights as the property owner under our management agreements we rely on sunrise’s personnel expertise technical resources and information systems proprietary information good faith and judgment to manage our seniors housing operating properties efficiently and effectively we also rely on sunrise to set appropriate resident fees to provide accurate propertylevel financial results for our properties in a timely manner and to otherwise operate them in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations any adverse developments in sunrise’s business or financial condition could impair its ability to manage our properties efficiently and effectively which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition for example we depend on sunrise’s ability to attract and retain skilled management personnel who are responsible for the daytoday operations of our seniors housing operating properties a shortage of nurses or other trained personnel or general inflationary pressures may force sunrise to enhance its pay and benefits packages to compete effectively for such personnel but it may not be able to offset these added costs by increasing the rates charged to residents any increase in labor costs and other property operating expenses any failure by sunrise to attract and retain qualified personnel or significant changes in sunrise’s senior management or equity ownership could adversely affect the income we receive from our seniors housing operating properties and have a material adverse effect on us also if sunrise experiences any significant financial legal accounting or regulatory difficulties such difficulties 

could result in among other things acceleration of its indebtedness impairment of its continued access to capital or the commencement of insolvency proceedings by or against it under the us bankruptcy code which in turn could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition if we determine to sell or transition additional properties currently managed by sunrise we may experience operational challenges andor significantly declining financial performance for those properties see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

we depend on promedica health system promedica and genesis healthcare “genesis” for a significant portion of our revenues and any failure inability or unwillingness by them to satisfy obligations under their agreements with us could adversely affect us   

the properties we lease to promedica and genesis account for a significant portion of our revenues and because these leases are triplenet leases we also depend on promedica and genesis to pay all insurance taxes utilities and maintenance and repair expenses in connection with the leased properties we cannot assure you that promedica and genesis will have sufficient assets income and access to financing to enable them to make rental payments to us or to otherwise satisfy their respective obligations under our leases and any failure inability or unwillingness by promedica and genesis to do so could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition promedica and genesis have also agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses and we cannot assure you that promedica and genesis will have sufficient assets income access to financing and insurance coverage to enable them to satisfy their respective indemnification obligations promedica and genesiss failure to effectively conduct their operations or to maintain and improve our properties could adversely affect their business reputations and their ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties which in turn could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition additionally we have made real estate and other loans to genesis and their operational or other failures could adversely impact their ability to repay these loans when due 

ownership of property outside the us may subject us to different or greater risks than those associated with our domestic operations   

we have operations in the uk and canada which represent 88 and 91 of total welltower revenues respectively as of december 31 2019 revera managed 94 of our seniors housing operating properties in canada representing a significant portion of our revenues and also owned a controlling interest in sunrise international development ownership and operating activities involve risks that are different from those we face with respect to our domestic properties and operations these risks include but are not limited to any international currency gain recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates which may not qualify under the 75 gross income test or the 95 gross income test required for us to satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a reit challenges with respect to the repatriation of foreign earnings and cash impact from international trade disputes and the associated impact on our tenants supply chain and consumer spending levels changes in foreign political regulatory and economic conditions regionally nationally and locally including but not limited to continuing uncertainty surrounding the process of brexit and the macroeconomic and regulatory effects of brexit including impacts on the uk real estate market challenges in managing international operations challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations including those relating to real estate corporate governance operations taxes employment and other civil and criminal legal proceedings foreign ownership restrictions with respect to operations in foreign countries local businesses and cultural factors that differ from our usual standards and practices differences in lending practices and the willingness of domestic or foreign lenders to provide financing regional or countryspecific business cycles and political and economic instability and failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations in the us that affect foreign operations including but not limited to the us foreign corrupt practices act if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with international expansion and operations our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected   

the business and financial results of our operations located in the uk may be negatively impacted as a result of brexit 

the uk’s referendum on withdrawal from the eu in 2016 commonly referred to as “brexit” and subsequent notification of the uk’s intention to withdraw from the eu given in march 2017 have adversely impacted global markets and foreign currencies the terms governing the future relationship between the uk and the eu as well as the legal and economic consequences of those terms remain unclear including with respect to the postbrexit regulatory environment in the uk it is possible that the level of health care and other economic activity in the uk and the rest of europe will be adversely impacted and that we will face increased regulatory and legal complexities in these regions which could have an adverse impact on the financial condition and results of operations of our properties in the uk 

moreover the value of the british pound sterling incurred significant fluctuations if the value of the british pound sterling continues to incur similar fluctuations unfavorable exchange rate changes may negatively affect the value of our operations located in the uk as translated to our reporting currency the us dollar in accordance with us gaap which may impact the revenue and earnings we report continued fluctuations in the british pound sterling may also result in the imposition of price adjustments by eubased suppliers to our uk operations as those suppliers seek to compensate for the changes in value of the british pound sterling as compared to the european euro 

if our tenants do not renew their existing leases or if we are required to sell properties for liquidity reasons we may be unable to lease or sell the properties on favorable terms or at all 

we cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases at the end of their lease terms which expire at various times if these leases are not renewed we would be required to find other tenants to occupy those properties or sell them there can be no assurance that we would be able to identify suitable replacement tenants or enter into leases with new tenants on terms as favorable to us as the current leases or that we would be able to lease those properties at all our competitors may offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our customers we may lose potential customers and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge to retain customers when leases expire in addition our ability to reposition our properties with a suitable replacement tenant or operator could be significantly delayed or limited by state licensing receivership con or other laws as well as by the medicare and medicaid changeofownership rules and we could incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any licensing receivership or changeofownership proceedings even if tenants decide to renew or lease new space the terms of renewals or new leases including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants may be less favorable to us than current lease terms 

real estate investments are relatively illiquid and most of the property we own is highly customized for specific uses our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in operator economic and other conditions will be limited no assurances can be given that we will recognize full value for any property that we are required to sell our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition we are exposed to the risks inherent in concentrating investments in real estate and in particular the seniors housing and health care industries a downturn in the real estate industry could adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to sell properties for a price or on terms acceptable to us 

our tenants operators and managers may not have the necessary insurance coverage to insure adequately against losses   

we maintain or require our tenants operators and managers to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties and their operations with terms conditions limits and deductibles that we believe are customary for similarly situated companies in our industry and we frequently review our insurance programs and requirements our tenants operators and manager may not be able to maintain adequate levels of insurance and required coverages also we may not be able to require the same levels of insurance coverage under our lease management and other agreements which could adversely affect us in the event of a significant uninsured loss we cannot make any guarantee as to the future financial viability of the insurers that underwrite our policies and the policies maintained by our tenants operators and managers insurance may not be available at a reasonable cost in the future or policies may not be maintained at a level that will fully cover all losses on our properties upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event this may be especially the case due to increases in property insurance costs in addition in recent years longtermpostacute care and seniors housing operators and managers have experienced substantial increases in both the number and size of patient care liability claims as a result general and professional liability costs have increased in some markets general and professional liability insurance coverage may be restricted or very costly which may adversely affect the tenants’ operators’ and managers’ future operations cash flows and financial conditions and may have a material adverse effect on the tenants’ operators’ and managers’ ability to meet their obligations to us 

our ownership of properties through ground leases exposes us to the loss of such properties upon breach or termination of the ground leases   

we have acquired an interest in certain of our properties by acquiring a leasehold interest in the property on which the building is located and we may acquire additional properties in the future through the purchase of interests in ground leases many of these ground leases impose significant limitations on our uses of the subject properties restrict our ability to sell or otherwise transfer our interests in the properties or restrict the leasing of the properties these restrictions may limit our ability to timely sell or exchange the properties impair the properties’ value or negatively impact our ability to find suitable tenants for the properties as the lessee under a ground lease we are exposed to the possibility of losing the property upon termination of the ground lease or an earlier breach of the ground lease by us 

the requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare medicaid or government funding could have a material adverse effect on our obligors’ liquidity financial condition and results of operations which could adversely affect our obligors’ ability to meet their obligations to us   

some of our obligors’ businesses are affected by government reimbursement to the extent that an operatortenant receives a significant portion of its revenues from government payors primarily medicare and medicaid such revenues may be subject to statutory and regulatory changes retroactive rate adjustments recovery of program overpayments or setoffs court decisions administrative rulings policy interpretations payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers government funding restrictions at a program level or with respect to specific facilities any lapse in congressional funding of the centers for medicare and medicaid services and interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing government investigations and audits at such property in recent years government payors have frozen or reduced payments to health care providers due to budgetary pressures federal and state authorities may continue seeking to implement new or modified reimbursement methodologies that may negatively impact health care property operations see “item 1  business  certain government regulations  united states  reimbursement” 

above for additional information health care reimbursement will likely continue to be of paramount importance to federal and state authorities we cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or effect any future legislative reforms may have on the financial condition of our obligors and properties there can be no assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will be available for services provided by any property operator whether the property receives reimbursement from medicare medicaid or private payors significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on an obligor’s liquidity financial condition and results of operations which could adversely affect the ability of an obligor to meet its obligations to us 

since january 1 2014 the health reform laws have provided those states that expand their medicaid coverage to otherwise eligible state residents with incomes at or below 138 of the federal poverty level with an increased federal medical assistance percentage effective january 1 2014 when certain conditions are met given that the federal government substantially funds the medicaid expansion it is unclear how many states will ultimately pursue this option although as of early january 2020 more than 70 of the states have expanded medicaid coverage the participation by states in the medicaid expansion could have the dual effect of increasing our tenants’ revenues through new patients but further straining state budgets and their ability to pay our tenants 

the status of the health reform laws may be subject to change as a result of political legislative regulatory and administrative developments and judicial proceedings the current presidential administration and us congress have sought to and may continue to seek to modify repeal or otherwise invalidate all or certain provisions of the health reform laws including medicaid expansion since taking office president trump has continued to support the repeal of all or portions of the health reform laws see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — united states — reimbursement” above for additional information if the operations cash flows or financial condition of our operators and tenants are materially adversely impacted by the health reform laws or future legislation our revenue and operations may be adversely affected as well more generally and because of the dynamic nature of the legislative and regulatory environment for health care products and services and in light of existing federal deficit and budgetary concerns we cannot predict the impact that broadbased farreaching legislative or regulatory changes could have on the us economy our business or that of our operators and tenants 

if controls imposed on certain of our tenants who provide health care services that are reimbursed by medicare medicaid and other thirdparty payors to reduce admissions and length of stay affect inpatient volumes at our health care facilities the financial condition or results of operations of those tenants could be adversely affected 

controls imposed by medicare medicaid and commercial thirdparty payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay commonly referred to as “utilization reviews” have affected and are expected to continue to affect certain of our health care facilities specifically our acute care hospitals and postacute facilities utilization review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by managed care plans inpatient utilization average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payorrequired preadmission authorization and utilization review and by payor pressures to maximize outpatient and alternative health care delivery services for less acutely ill patients efforts to impose more stringent cost controls and reductions are expected to continue which could negatively impact the financial condition of our tenants who provide health care services in our hospitals and postacute facilities if so this could adversely affect these tenants’ ability and willingness to comply with the terms of their leases with us andor renew those leases upon expiration which could have a material adverse effect on us 

our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with federal state province local and industryregulated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards could adversely affect such operators’ or tenants’ operations which could adversely affect our operators’ and tenants’ ability to meet their obligations to us   

our operators and tenants generally are subject to or impacted by varying levels of federal state local and industryregulated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards these laws and regulations include among others laws protecting consumers against deceptive practices laws relating to the operation of our properties and how our tenants and operators conduct their business such as fire health and safety data security and privacy laws federal and state laws affecting hospitals clinics and other health care communities that participate in both medicare and medicaid that specify reimbursement rates pricing reimbursement procedures and limitations quality of services and care background checks food service and physical plants and similar foreign laws regulating the health care industry resident rights laws including abuse and neglect laws and fraud laws antikickback and physician referral laws the ada and similar state and local laws and safety and health standards set by the occupational safety and health administration or similar foreign agencies our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with any of these laws regulations or standards could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension decertification or exclusion from federal and state health care programs civil liability and in certain limited instances criminal penalties loss of license closure of the facility andor the incurrence of considerable costs arising from an investigation or regulatory action such actions may have an effect on our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make lease payments to us and therefore adversely impact us in addition we may be directly subject to certain health care fraud and abuse laws and data privacy laws as well as potential investigation or enforcement as a result of our rideastructured arrangements and certain other arrangements we may pursue with healthcare entities who are directly subject to these laws see “item 1  business  certain government regulations 

 united states  fraud  abuse enforcement” and “item 1  business  certain government regulations  united states  health care matters  generally” above 

many of our properties may require a license registration andor con to operate failure to obtain a license registration or con or loss of a required license registration or con would prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by the operators or tenants these events could materially adversely affect our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make rent or other obligatory payments to us state and local laws also may regulate the expansion including the addition of new beds or services or acquisition of medical equipment and the construction or renovation of health care facilities by requiring a con or other similar approval from a state agency see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — united states — licensing and certification” above 

in addition we cannot assure you that future changes in government regulation will not adversely affect the health care industry including our tenants and operators nor can we be certain that our tenants and operators will achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels or labor cost levels that will enable them to satisfy their obligations to us 

changes in applicable tax regulations could negatively affect our financial results   

we are subject to taxation in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions because the us maintains a worldwide corporate tax system the foreign and us tax systems are somewhat interdependent longstanding international norms that determine each country’s jurisdiction to tax crossborder international trade are evolving and could reduce the ability of our foreign subsidiaries to deduct for foreign tax purposes the interest they pay on loans from us thereby increasing the foreign tax liability of the subsidiaries it is also possible that foreign countries could increase their withholding taxes on dividends and interest given the unpredictability of these possible changes and their potential interdependency it is very difficult to assess the overall effect of such potential tax changes on our earnings and cash flow but such changes could adversely impact our financial results 

unfavorable resolution of pending and future litigation matters and disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

from time to time we are directly involved in legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims we also are named as defendants in lawsuits allegedly arising out of our actions or the actions of our operatorstenants or managers in which such operatorstenants or managers have agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail in or achieve a favorable settlement of pending or future litigation in addition pending litigation or future litigation government proceedings or environmental matters could lead to increased costs or interruption of our normal business operations an unfavorable resolution of pending or future litigation or legal proceedings may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition regardless of its outcome litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses significantly divert the attention of management and could damage our reputation and our brand in addition any such resolution could involve our agreement to terms that restrict the operation of our business we cannot guarantee losses incurred in connection with any current or future legal or regulatory proceedings or actions will not exceed any provisions we may have set aside in respect of such proceedings or actions or will not exceed any available insurance coverage 

development redevelopment and construction risks could affect our profitability 

in connection with our renovation redevelopment development and related construction activities we may be unable to obtain or suffer delays in obtaining necessary zoning landuse building occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations these factors could result in increased costs or our abandonment of these projects in addition we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms which may render us unable to proceed with our development activities and we may not be able to complete construction and leaseup of a property on schedule which could result in increased debt service expense or construction costs additionally the time frame required for development construction and leaseup of these properties means that we may have to wait years for significant cash returns because we are required to make cash distributions to our stockholders if the cash flow from operations or refinancing is not sufficient we may be forced to borrow additional money to fund such distributions we may be unable to obtain financing with favorable terms or at all for the proposed development which may cause us to delay or abandon an opportunity newly developed and acquired properties may not produce the cash flow that we expect which could adversely affect our overall financial performance 

in deciding whether to acquire or develop a particular property we make assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property in particular we estimate the return on our investment based on expected occupancy rental rates and capital costs if our financial projections with respect to a new property are inaccurate as a result of increases in capital costs or other factors the property may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment our estimate of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove to be inaccurate which may result in our failure to meet our profitability goals additionally we may acquire new properties that are not fully leased and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with that property   

new facilities that we construct often require a con and license before they can be utilized by the operator for their intended use the operator also may need to obtain medicare and medicaid certification and enter into medicare and medicaid provider agreements andor thirdparty payor contracts in the event that the operator is unable to obtain the necessary con licensure certification provider agreements or contracts after the completion of construction there is a risk that we will not be able to earn any revenues on the facility until either the initial operator obtains a license or certification to operate the new facility and the necessary provider agreements or contracts or we find and contract with a new operator that is able to obtain a license to operate the facility for its intended use and the necessary provider agreements or contracts 

we may experience losses caused by severe weather conditions natural disasters or the physical effects of climate change which could result in an increase of our or our tenants’ cost of insurance unanticipated costs associated with evacuation a decrease in our anticipated revenues or a significant loss of the capital we have invested in a property   

we maintain or require our tenants to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties with terms conditions limits and deductibles that we believe are appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage and we frequently review our insurance programs and requirements however a large number of our properties are located in areas particularly susceptible to revenue loss cost increase or damage caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters such as hurricanes earthquakes tornadoes and floods as well as the effects of climate change we believe given current industry practice and analysis prepared by outside consultants that our and our tenants’ insurance coverage is appropriate to cover reasonably anticipated losses that may be caused by hurricanes earthquakes tornadoes floods and other severe weather conditions and natural disasters including the effects of climate change nevertheless we are always subject to the risk that such insurance will not fully cover all losses and depending on the severity of the event and the impact on our properties such insurance may not cover a significant portion of the losses including but not limited to the costs associated with evacuation these losses may lead to an increase of our and our tenants’ cost of insurance a decrease in our anticipated revenues from an affected property and a loss of all or a portion of the capital we have invested in an affected property in addition we or our tenants may not purchase insurance under certain circumstances if the cost of insurance exceeds in our or our tenants’ judgment the value of the coverage relative to the risk of loss also changes in federal and state legislation and regulation relating to climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency and resiliency of our existing properties and could also necessitate us to spend more on our new development properties without a corresponding increase in revenue 

to the extent that significant changes in the climate occur in areas where our communities are located we may experience extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature all of which may result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions should the impact of climate change be material in nature including significant property damage to or destruction of our communities or occur for lengthy periods of time our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected in addition changes in federal state and local legislation and regulation based on concerns about climate change could result in increased capital expenditures on our existing properties and our new development properties without a corresponding increase in revenue resulting in adverse impacts to our net income 

we may incur costs to remediate environmental contamination at our properties which could have an adverse effect on our or our obligors’ business or financial condition 

under various laws owners or operators of real estate may be required to respond to the presence or release of hazardous substances on the property and may be held liable for property damage personal injuries or penalties that result from environmental contamination or exposure to hazardous substances these laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of the release of the substances or caused the release we may become liable to reimburse the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination generally such liability attaches to a person based on the person’s relationship to the property our tenants or borrowers are primarily responsible for the condition of the property moreover we review environmental site assessments of the properties that we own or encumber prior to taking an interest in them those assessments are designed to meet the “all appropriate inquiry” standard which we believe qualifies us for the innocent purchaser defense if environmental liabilities arise based upon such assessments we do not believe that any of our properties are subject to material environmental contamination however environmental liabilities may be present in our properties and we may incur costs to remediate contamination which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition or the business or financial condition of our obligors   

cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our business and result in the loss of confidential information 

our business is at risk from and may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential data through phishing or other malicious activity attempts to interrupt our access to or use of it systems through distributed denialofservice or ransomware attacks breaches related to our increased receipt and use of data from multiple sources and other electronic security breaches or other cybersecurity incidents including those resulting from human error product defects and technology failures such cyberattacks can range from individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems to more sophisticated security threats and may be specifically targeted to our business or more general industry wide risks our information technology networks and related systems are essential to our ability to perform daytoday operations of our business while we employ a number of measures to prevent detect and mitigate these threats there is no guarantee such 

efforts will be successful in preventing a cyberattack even the most wellprotected information networks systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted cybersecurity breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target and in some cases are designed not to be detected and in fact may not be detected accordingly we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate cybersecurity barriers or other preventative measures and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk in the past we have experienced cybersecurity breaches which to date have not had a material impact on our operations however there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future we must continuously monitor and develop our systems to protect our technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our business damage our reputation cause us to incur significant remediation expense and have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations   cybersecurity breaches that compromise proprietary personal identifying or confidential information of our employees operators tenants and partners could result in legal claims or proceedings including under data privacy regulations 

our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed 

our success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel including our executive officers and other highly qualified employees and competition for their talents is intense there is substantial competition for qualified personnel we cannot assure you that we will retain our key personnel or that we will be able to recruit and retain other highly qualified employees in the future losing any key personnel could at least temporarily have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations   

risks arising from our capital structure   

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain antitakeover provisions 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain antitakeover provisions restrictions on share ownership and transfer and super majority stockholder approval requirements for business combinations that could make it more difficult for or even prevent a third party from acquiring us without the approval of our incumbent board of directors provisions and agreements that inhibit or discourage takeover attempts could reduce the market value of our common stock 

we may become more leveraged   

permanent financing for our investments is typically provided through a combination of public offerings of debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt the incurrence or assumption of indebtedness may cause us to become more leveraged which could 1 require us to dedicate a greater portion of our cash flow to the payment of debt service 2 make us more vulnerable to a downturn in the economy 3 limit our ability to obtain additional financing 4 negatively affect our credit ratings or outlook by one or more of the rating agencies or 5 make us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates because of the variable interest rates on some of our borrowings to the extent we have not entirely hedged such variable rate debt 

cash available for distributions to stockholders may be insufficient to make dividend contributions at expected levels and are made at the discretion of the board of directors   

if cash available for distribution generated by our assets decreases due to dispositions or otherwise we may be unable to make dividend distributions at expected levels our inability to make expected distributions would likely result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock all distributions are made at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with delaware law and depend on our earnings our financial condition debt and equity capital available to us our expectation of our future capital requirements and operating performance restrictive covenants in our financial and other contractual arrangements maintenance of our reit qualification restrictions under delaware law and other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time additionally our ability to make distributions will be adversely affected if any of the risks described herein or other significant adverse events occur   

we are subject to covenants in our debt agreements that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our debt agreements contain various covenants restrictions and events of default among other things these provisions require us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness create liens and make investments or acquisitions breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness in addition to any other indebtedness crossdefaulted against such instruments these defaults could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to make future investments or to meet our obligations and commitments 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the capital necessary to make future investments or to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature our access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control including rising interest rates inflation and other general market conditions the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions the market price of the shares of our common stock and the credit 

ratings of our debt securities changes in the credit ratings on us government debt securities uncertainty from the expected discontinuance of libor and the transition to any other interest rate benchmark and default or delay in payment by the us of its obligations we also rely on the financial institutions that are parties to our revolving credit facilities if these institutions become capital constrained tighten their lending standards or become insolvent or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from other borrowers within a short period of time they may be unable or unwilling to honor their funding commitments to us which would adversely affect our ability to draw on our revolving credit facilities and over time could negatively impact our ability to consummate acquisitions repay indebtedness as it matures fund capital expenditures or make distributions to our stockholders if our access to capital is limited by these factors or other factors it could negatively impact our ability to acquire properties repay or refinance our indebtedness fund operations or make distributions to our stockholders 

changes affecting the availability of the london interbank offered rate “libor” may have consequences for us that cannot yet reasonably be predicted 

we have outstanding debt hedge agreements and receivable transactions with variable interest rates based on libor the libor benchmark has been subject of national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform in july 2017 the uk financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021 these reforms may cause libor to perform differently than in the past and libor may ultimately cease to exist after 2021 while it is not currently possible to determine precisely whether or to what extent the withdrawal and replacement of libor would affect us the implementation of alternative benchmark rates to libor may have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition any new benchmark rate will likely not replicate libor exactly which could impact contracts that terminate after 2021 there is uncertainty about how applicable law the courts or we will address the replacement of libor with alternative rates on agreements that do not include alternative rate fallback provisions in addition any changes to benchmark rates may have an uncertain impact on our cost of funds and our access to the capital markets which could impact our results of operations and cash flows uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes may also adversely affect the trading market for our securities additional financing therefore may be unavailable more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness 

downgrades in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our cost and availability of capital 

we plan to manage the company to maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile but there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the rating agencies could have a material adverse effect on our cost and availability of capital which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity cash flows the tradingredemption price of our securities and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to our equity holders 

increases in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our cost of capital 

an increase in interest rates may increase interest cost on new and existing variable rate debt such increases in the cost of capital could adversely impact our ability to finance operations acquire and develop properties and refinance existing debt additionally increased interest rates may also result in less liquid property markets limiting our ability to sell existing assets 

fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

currency exchange rate fluctuations could affect our results of operations and financial position including exchange rate fluctuations resulting from brexit we generate a portion of our revenue and expenses in such foreign currencies as the canadian dollar and the british pound sterling although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions andor obtain local currency mortgage debt in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies we cannot assure you that foreign currency fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on us 

our entry into hedge agreements may not effectively reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates   

we enter into hedge agreements from time to time to manage some of our exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate volatility these agreements involve risks such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements that the amount of income we earn from hedging transactions may be limited by federal tax provisions governing reits and that these arrangements may cause us to pay higher interest rates on our debt obligations than otherwise would be the case in addition these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates when we use forwardstarting interest rate swaps there is a risk that we will not complete the longterm borrowing against which the swap is intended to hedge if such events occur our results of operations may be adversely affected 

risks arising from our status as a reit   

we might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a reit   

we intend to operate as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” and believe we have operated and will continue to operate in such a manner if we lose our status as a reit we will face serious income tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for satisfying our obligations and for distribution to our stockholders because 

 since reit qualification requires us to meet a number of complex requirements it is possible that we may fail to fulfill them and if we do our earnings will be reduced by the amount of us federal and other income taxes owed a reduction in our earnings would affect the amount we could distribute to our stockholders if we do not qualify as a reit we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders since a nonreit is not required to pay dividends to stockholders in order to maintain reit status or avoid an excise tax in addition if we fail to qualify as a reit all distributions to stockholders will continue to be treated as dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits although corporate stockholders may be eligible for the dividends received deduction and individual stockholders may be eligible for taxation at the rates generally applicable to longterm capital gains with respect to distributions 

as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to implement our business strategy and would adversely affect the value of our common stock qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to remain qualified as a reit although we believe that we qualify as a reit we cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as a reit for us federal income tax purposes 

certain subsidiaries might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

we own interests in a number of entities which have elected to be taxed as reits for us federal income tax purposes some of which we consolidate for financial reporting purposes but each of which is treated as a separate reit for federal income tax purposes each a “subsidiary reit” to qualify as a reit each subsidiary reit must independently satisfy all of the reit qualification requirements under the code together with all other rules applicable to reits provided that each subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit our interests in the subsidiary reits will be treated as qualifying real estate assets for purposes of the reit asset tests if a subsidiary reit fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year such subsidiary reit will be subject to federal and state income taxes and may not be able to qualify as a reit for the four subsequent taxable years any such failure could have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reit income and asset tests and thus our ability to qualify as a reit unless we are able to avail ourselves of certain relief provisions   

the 90 annual distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions   

to comply with the 90 distribution requirement applicable to reits and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax we must make distributions to our stockholders although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the reit distribution requirement it is possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90 distribution requirement this may be due to timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses on the one hand and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income on the other hand in addition nondeductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of noncash deductions may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90 distribution requirement in the event that timing differences occur or we deem it appropriate to retain cash we may borrow funds even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings issue additional equity securities although we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so pay taxable stock dividends if possible distribute other property or securities or engage in other transactions intended to enable us to meet the reit distribution requirements this may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations   

our use of trss is limited under the code 

under the code no more than 20 of the value of the gross assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss this limitation may affect our ability to increase the size of our trss’ operations and assets and there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the applicable limitation or that such compliance will not adversely affect our business also our trss may not among other things operate or manage certain health care facilities which may cause us to forgo investments 

we might otherwise make finally we may be subject to a 100 excise tax on the income derived from certain transactions with our trss that are not on an armslength basis we believe our arrangements with our trss are on armslength terms and intend to continue to operate in a manner that allows us to avoid incurring the 100 excise tax described above but there can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid application of that tax 

the lease of qualified health care properties to a taxable reit subsidiary is subject to special requirements 

we lease certain qualified health care properties to taxable reit subsidiaries or limited liability companies of which the taxable reit subsidiaries are members which lessees contract with managers or related parties to manage the health care operations at these properties the rents from this taxable reit subsidiary lessee structure are treated as qualifying rents from real property if 1 they are paid pursuant to an armslength lease of a qualified health care property with a taxable reit subsidiary and 2 the manager qualifies as an eligible independent contractor as defined in the code if any of these conditions are not satisfied then the rents will not be qualifying rents 

if certain saleleaseback transactions are not characterized by the internal revenue service “irs” as “true leases” we may be subject to adverse tax consequences   

we have purchased certain properties and leased them back to the sellers of such properties and we may enter into similar transactions in the future we intend for any such saleleaseback transaction to be structured in such a manner that the lease will be characterized as a “true lease” thereby allowing us to be treated as the owner of the property for us federal income tax purposes however depending on the terms of any specific transaction the irs might take the position that the transaction is not a “true lease” but is more properly treated in some other manner in the event any saleleaseback transaction is challenged and successfully recharacterized by the irs we would not be entitled to claim the deductions for depreciation and cost recovery generally available to an owner of property furthermore if a saleleaseback transaction were so recharacterized we might fail to satisfy the reit asset tests or income tests and consequently could lose our reit status effective with the year of recharacterization alternatively the amount of our reit taxable income could be recalculated which may cause us to fail to meet the reit annual distribution requirements for a taxable year 

we could be subject to changes in our tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to taxes in the us and foreign jurisdictions our effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates or changes in tax laws or their interpretation we are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the irs and other tax authorities and governmental bodies we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations if we were subject to review or examination by the irs or applicable foreign jurisdiction as the result of any new tax law changes the ultimate determination of which may change our taxes owed for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued or recorded our financial condition operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected 

the present federal income tax treatment of reits may be modified possibly with retroactive effect by legislative judicial or administrative action at any time which could affect the federal income tax treatment of an investment in us the federal income tax rules dealing with us federal income taxation and reits are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process the irs and the us treasury department which results in statutory changes as well as frequent revisions to regulations and interpretations we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors or us revisions in federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a reit as well as the tax considerations relevant to an investment in us or could cause us to change our investments and commitments

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various market risks including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we seek to mitigate the underlying foreign currency exposures with gains and losses on derivative contracts hedging these exposures we seek to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates by matching the terms of new investments with new longterm fixed rate borrowings to the extent possible we may or may not elect to use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate exposure these decisions are principally based on our policy to match our variable rate investments with comparable borrowings but are also based on the general trend in interest rates at the applicable dates and our perception of the future volatility of interest rates this section is presented to provide a discussion of the risks associated with potential fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates for more information see notes 12 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements 

we historically borrow on our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program to acquire construct or make loans relating to health care and seniors housing properties then as market conditions dictate we will issue equity or longterm fixed rate debt to repay the borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program we are subject to risks associated with debt financing including the risk that existing indebtedness may not be refinanced or that the terms of refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of current indebtedness the majority of our borrowings were completed under indentures or contractual agreements that limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur accordingly in the event that we are unable to raise additional equity or borrow money because of these limitations our ability to acquire additional properties may be limited 

a change in interest rates will not affect the interest expense associated with our fixed rate debt interest rate changes however will affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt changes in the interest rate environment upon maturity of this fixed rate debt could have an effect on our future cash flows and earnings depending on whether the debt is replaced with other fixed rate debt variable rate debt or equity or repaid by the sale of assets to illustrate the impact of changes in the interest rate markets we performed a sensitivity analysis on our fixed rate debt instruments whereby we modeled the change in net present values arising from a hypothetical 1 increase in interest rates to determine the instruments’ change in fair value the following table summarizes the analysis performed as of the dates indicated in thousands 



  

our variable rate debt including our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program is reflected at fair value at december 31 2019  we had  3470584000 outstanding related to our variable rate debt assuming no changes in outstanding balances a 1 increase in interest rates would result in increased annual interest expense of  34706000  at december 31 2018  we had  2683553000 outstanding under our variable rate debt assuming no changes in outstanding balances a 1 increase in interest rates would have resulted in increased annual interest expense of  26836000  

we are subject to currency fluctuations that may from time to time affect our financial condition and results of operations increases or decreases in the value of the canadian dollar or british pounds sterling relative to the us dollar impact the amount of net income we earn from our investments in canada and the united kingdom based solely on our results for the year ended december 31 2019  including the impact of existing hedging arrangements if these exchange rates were to increase or decrease by 10 our net income from these investments would increase or decrease as applicable by less than  13000000  we will continue to mitigate these underlying foreign currency exposures with nonus denominated borrowings and gains and losses on derivative contracts if we increase our international presence through investments in or acquisitions or development of seniors housing and health care properties outside the us we may also decide to transact additional business or borrow funds in currencies other than us dollars canadian dollars or british pounds sterling to illustrate the impact of changes in foreign currency markets we performed a sensitivity analysis on our derivative portfolio whereby we modeled the change in net present values arising from a hypothetical 1 increase in foreign currency exchange rates to determine the instruments’ change in fair value the following table summarizes the results of the analysis performed excluding cross currency hedge activity dollars in thousands

investments 

providing highquality and affordable health care to an aging global population requires vast investments and infrastructure development we invest in seniors housing and health care real estate primarily through acquisitions developments and joint venture partnerships for additional information regarding acquisition and development activity please see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements our portfolio creates opportunities to connect partners across the continuum of care and drive efficiency we seek to diversify our investment portfolio by property type relationship and geographic location in determining whether to invest in a property we focus on the following 1 the experience of the obligor’spartner’s management team 2 the 

historical and projected financial and operational performance of the property 3 the credit of the obligorpartner 4 the security for any lease or loan 5 the real estate attributes of the building and its location 6 the capital committed to the property by the obligorpartner and 7 the operating fundamentals of the applicable industry 

we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property our asset management process for seniors housing properties generally includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each property review of obligorpartner creditworthiness property inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure real estate taxes letters of credit and other collateral our internal property management division manages and monitors the outpatient medical portfolio with a comprehensive process including review of among other things tenant relations lease expirations the mix of health service providers hospitalhealth system relationships property performance capital improvement needs and market conditions 

investment types   

real property our properties are primarily comprised of land buildings improvements and related rights our triplenet properties are generally leased to operators under longterm operating leases the leases generally have a fixed contractual term of 12 to 15 years and contain one or more five to 15year renewal options certain of our leases also contain purchase options a portion of which could result in the disposition of properties for less than full market value if the options were to be exercised most of our rents are received under triplenet leases requiring the operator to pay rent and all additional charges incurred in the operation of the leased property the tenants are required to repair rebuild and maintain the leased properties substantially all these operating leases are designed with escalating rent structures leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straightline basis over the initial lease period subject to a collectability assessment rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period 

at december 31 2018  approximately 94 of our triplenet properties were subject to master leases a master lease is a lease of multiple properties to one tenant entity under a single lease agreement from time to time we may acquire additional properties that are then leased to the tenant under the master lease the tenant is required to make one monthly payment that represents rent on all the properties that are subject to the master lease typically the master lease tenant can exercise its right to purchase the properties or to renew the master lease only with respect to all leased properties at the same time we believe this bundling feature benefits us because the tenant cannot limit the purchase or renewal to better performing properties and terminate the leasing arrangement with respect to poorer performing properties this spreads our risk among the entire group of properties within the master lease the bundling feature should provide a similar advantage to us if the master lease tenant is in bankruptcy subject to certain restrictions a debtor in bankruptcy has the right to assume or reject its unexpired leases and executory contracts in the context of integrated master leases such as ours our tenants in bankruptcy would be required to assume or reject the master lease as a whole rather than deciding on a property by property basis 

our outpatient medical portfolio is primarily selfmanaged and consists principally of multitenant properties leased to health care providers our leases typically include increasers and some form of operating expense reimbursement by the tenant as of december 31 2018  75 of our portfolio included leases with full pass through 23 with a partial expense reimbursement modified gross and 2 with no expense reimbursement gross our outpatient medical leases are noncancellable operating leases that have a weightedaverage remaining term of six years at december 31 2018 and are often credit enhanced by security deposits guaranties andor letters of credit 

construction we provide for the construction of properties for tenants primarily as part of longterm operating leases we capitalize certain interest costs associated with funds used for the construction of properties owned by us the amount capitalized is based upon the amount advanced during the construction period using the rate of interest that approximates our companywide cost of financing our interest expense is reduced by the amount capitalized we also typically charge a transaction fee at the commencement of construction which we defer and amortize to income over the term of the resulting lease the construction period commences upon funding and terminates upon the earlier of the completion of the applicable property or the end of a specified period during the construction period we advance funds to the tenants in accordance with agreed upon terms and conditions which require among other things periodic site visits by a company representative during the construction period we generally require an additional credit enhancement in the form of payment and performance bonds andor completion guaranties at december 31 2018  we had outstanding construction investments of 194365000 and were committed to provide additional funds of approximately  436984000 to complete construction for investment properties we also provide for construction loans which depending on the terms and conditions could be treated as loans real property or investments in unconsolidated entities 

real estate loans our real estate loans are typically structured to provide us with interest income principal amortization and transaction fees and are generally secured by firstsecond mortgage liens leasehold mortgages corporate guaranties andor personal guaranties at december 31 2018  we had gross outstanding real estate loans of 398711000  the interest yield averaged approximately 79 per annum on our outstanding real estate loan balances our yield on real estate loans depends upon a number of factors including the stated interest rate average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments the real estate loans outstanding at december 31 2018 are generally subject to one to 15year terms with principal amortization schedules andor balloon payments of the outstanding principal balances at the end of the term typically real estate 

loans are crossdefaulted and crosscollateralized with other real estate loans operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its affiliates 

investments in unconsolidated entities investments in entities that we do not consolidate but for which we can exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are reported under the equity method of accounting our investments in unconsolidated entities generally represent interests ranging from 10 to 50 in real estate assets under the equity method of accounting our share of the investee’s earnings or losses is included in our consolidated results of operations to the extent that our cost basis is different from the basis reflected at the entity level the basis difference is generally amortized over the lives of the related assets and liabilities and such amortization is included in our share of equity in earnings of the entity the initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated entities is based on the amount paid to purchase the entity interest inclusive of transaction costs we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the equity method investment to its carrying value when we determine a decline in the estimated fair value of such an investment below its carrying value is otherthantemporary an impairment is recorded 

principles of consolidation 

the consolidated financial statements are in conformity with us general accepted accounting principles “us gaap” and include the accounts of our whollyowned subsidiaries and joint venture entities that we control through voting rights or other means all material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation 

at inception of joint venture transactions we identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights “variable interest entities” or “vies” and determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of its operations a vie is broadly defined as an entity where either i the equity investors as a group if any do not have a controlling financial interest or ii the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support we consolidate investments in vies when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary accounting standards codification topic 810 consolidations requires enterprises to perform a qualitative approach to determining whether or not a vie will need to be consolidated this evaluation is based on an enterprise’s ability to direct and influence the activities of a vie that most significantly impact that entity’s economic performance 

for investments in joint ventures us gaap may preclude consolidation by the sole general partner in certain circumstances based on the type of rights held by the limited partners we assess the limited partners’ rights and their impact on our consolidation conclusions and we reassess if there is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights of the limited partners the sole general partner increases or decreases its ownership of limited partnership interests or there is an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding limited partnership interests we similarly evaluate the rights of managing members of limited liability companies 

borrowing policies 

we utilize a combination of debt and equity to fund investments generally we intend to issue unsecured fixedrate public debt with longterm maturities to approximate the maturities on our triplenet leases and investment strategy for shortterm purposes we may borrow on our primary unsecured credit facility or issue commercial paper we replace these borrowings with longterm capital such as senior unsecured notes or common stock when terms are deemed favorable we may invest in properties subject to existing mortgage indebtedness in addition we may obtain secured financing for unleveraged properties in which we have invested or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis in certain agreements with our lenders we are subject to restrictions with respect to secured and unsecured indebtedness 

competition 

we compete with other real estate investment trusts real estate partnerships private equity and hedge fund investors banks insurance companies financeinvestment companies governmentsponsored agencies taxable and taxexempt bond funds health care operators developers and other investors in the acquisition development leasing and financing of health care and seniors housing properties we compete for investments based on a number of factors including relationships certainty of execution investment structures and underwriting criteria our ability to successfully compete is impacted by economic and demographic trends availability of acceptable investment opportunities our ability to negotiate beneficial investment terms availability and cost of capital construction and renovation costs and applicable laws and regulations 

the operatorstenants of our properties compete with properties that provide comparable services in the local markets operatorstenants compete for patients and residents based on a number of factors including quality of care reputation physical appearance of properties location services offered family preferences physicians staff and price we also face competition from other health care facilities for tenants such as physicians and other health care providers that provide comparable facilities and services

health care industry 

the demand for health care services and consequently health care properties is projected to reach unprecedented levels in the near future the centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” projects that national health expenditures will rise to approximately 37 trillion in 2018 or 185 of gross domestic product the average annual growth in national health expenditures for 2015 through 2025 is expected to be 58 while demographics are the primary driver of demand economic conditions and availability of services contribute to health care service utilization rates we believe the health care property market may be less susceptible to fluctuations and economic downturns relative to other property sectors investor interest in the market remains strong especially in specific sectors such as privatepay seniors housing and outpatient medical buildings the total us population for 2015 through 2025 is projected to increase by 93 the elderly population aged 65 and over is projected to increase by 36 through 2025 the elderly are an important component of health care utilization especially independent living services assisted living services longtermpostacute care services inpatient and outpatient hospital services and physician ambulatory care most health care services are provided within a health care facility such as a hospital a physician’s office or a seniors housing community therefore we believe there will be continued demand for companies such as ours with expertise in health care real estate 

health care real estate investment opportunities tend to increase as demand for health care services increases we recognize the need for health care real estate as it correlates to health care service demand health care providers require real estate to house their businesses and expand their services we believe that investment opportunities in health care real estate will continue to be present due to 



certain government regulations 

united states 

health law matters — generally 

typically operators of seniors housing facilities do not receive significant funding from government programs and are largely subject to state laws as opposed to federal laws operators of longtermpostacute care facilities and hospitals do receive significant funding from government programs and these facilities are subject to extensive regulation including federal and state laws covering the type and quality of medical andor nursing care provided ancillary services  eg  respiratory occupational physical and infusion therapies qualifications of the administrative personnel and nursing staff the adequacy of the physical plant and equipment reimbursement and rate setting and operating policies in addition as described below operators of these facilities are subject to extensive laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including but not limited to the federal antikickback statute “aks” the federal stark law “stark law” and the federal false claims act “fca” as well as comparable state laws hospitals physician group practice clinics and other health care providers that operate in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal state and local licensure registration certification and inspection laws regulations and industry standards as well as other conditions of participation in federal and state government programs such as medicare or medicaid our tenants’ failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in among other things loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension decertification or exclusion from federal and state health care programs loss of license or closure of the facility see risk factors “the requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid could have a material adverse effect on our obligors’ liquidity financial condition and results of operations which could adversely affect our obligors’ ability to meet their obligations to us” and “our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with federal state local and industryregulated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards could adversely affect such operators’ or tenants’ operations which could adversely affect our operators’ and tenants’ ability to meet their obligations to us” in “item 1a – risk factors” below 

licensing and certification 

the primary regulations that affect longterm and postacute care facilities are state licensing and registration laws for example certain health care facilities are subject to a variety of licensure and certificate of need “con” laws and regulations where applicable con laws generally require among other requirements that a facility demonstrate the need for 1 constructing a new facility 2 adding beds or expanding an existing facility 3 investing in major capital equipment or adding new services 4 changing the ownership or control of an existing licensed facility or 5 terminating services that have been previously approved through the con process certain state con laws and regulations may restrict the ability of operators to add new properties or expand an existing facility’s size or services in addition con laws may constrain the ability of an operator to transfer responsibility for operating a particular facility to a new operator 

with respect to licensure generally our longtermpostacute care facilities are required to be licensed and certified for participation in medicare medicaid and other federal and state health care programs the failure of our operators to maintain or renew any required license or regulatory approval as well as the failure of our operators to correct serious deficiencies identified in a compliance survey could require those operators to discontinue operations at a property in addition if a property is found to be out of compliance with medicare medicaid or other federal or state health care program conditions of participation the property operator may be excluded from participating in those government health care programs 

reimbursement 

the reimbursement methodologies applied to health care facilities continue to evolve federal and state authorities have considered and may seek to implement new or modified reimbursement methodologies including valuebased reimbursement methodologies that may negatively impact health care property operations the impact of any such changes if implemented may result in a material adverse effect on our portfolio no assurance can be given that current revenue sources or levels will be maintained accordingly there can be no assurance that payments under a government health care program are currently or will be in the future sufficient to fully reimburse the property operators for their operating and capital expenses 



portions of the health reform laws for example in october 2017 president trump issued an executive order in which he stated that it is his administration’s policy to seek the prompt repeal of the health reform laws and directed executive departments and federal agencies to waive defer grant exemptions from or delay the implementation of the provisions of the health reform laws to the maximum extent permitted by law on the same day the federal government separately announced that costsharing reduction payments to insurers offering qualified health plans through the hies would end effective immediately unless congress appropriated the funds further in december 2017 the us congress passed the tax cuts and jobs act which included a provision that eliminates the penalty under the health reform laws’ individual mandate and could impact the future state of the hies established by the health reform laws there is still uncertainty with respect to the additional impact president trump’s administration and the us congress may have if any and any changes will likely take time to unfold and could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for health care items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the health reform laws we cannot predict whether the existing health reform laws or future health care reform legislation or regulatory changes will have a material impact on our operators’ or tenants’ property or business 

fraud  abuse enforcement 

longtermpostacute care facilities and seniors housing facilities that receive medicaid payments are subject to federal state and local laws regulations and applicable guidance that govern the operations and financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by health care providers certain of these laws such as the aks and stark law prohibit direct or indirect payments of any kind for the purpose of inducing or encouraging the referral of patients for medical products or services reimbursable by government health care programs other government health program laws require providers to furnish only medically necessary services and submit to the government valid and accurate statements for each service our operators and tenants that receive payments from federal healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid are subject to substantial financial penalties under the civil monetary penalties act and the fca upon a finding of noncompliance with such laws in addition states may also have separate false claims acts which among other things generally prohibit health care providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payments federal and state fcas contain whistleblower provisions that permit private individuals to bring health care fraud enforcement claims on behalf of the government still other laws require providers to comply with a variety of safety health and other requirements relating to the condition of the licensed property and the quality of care provided sanctions for violations of these laws regulations and other applicable guidance may include but are not limited to criminal andor civil penalties and fines loss of licensure immediate termination of government payments exclusion from any government health care program damage assessments and imprisonment in certain circumstances violation of these rules such as those prohibiting abusive and fraudulent behavior with respect to one property may subject other facilities under common control or ownership to sanctions including exclusion from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs as well as other government health care programs in the ordinary course of its business a property operator is regularly subjected to inquiries investigations and audits by the federal and state agencies that oversee these laws and regulations 

prosecutions investigations or whistleblower actions could have a material adverse effect on a property operator’s liquidity financial condition and operations which could adversely affect the ability of the operator to meet its financial obligations to us in addition government investigations and enforcement actions brought against the health care industry have increased dramatically over the past several years and are expected to continue the costs for an operator of a health care property associated with both defending such enforcement actions and the undertakings in settling these actions can be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its obligations to us 

federal and state data privacy and security laws 

the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” as amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act and numerous other state and federal laws govern the collection security dissemination use access to and confidentiality of individually identifiable health information violations of these laws may result in substantial civil andor criminal fines and penalties the costs for an operator of a health care property associated with developing and maintaining hipaa compliance systems defending enforcement actions and paying any assessed fines can be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its obligations to us 

united kingdom 

in the uk care home services are principally regulated by the health and social care act 2008 as amended and other regulations this legislation subjects service providers to a number of legally binding “fundamental standards” and requires amongst other things that all persons carrying out “regulated activities” in the uk and the managers of such persons be registered providers of care home services are also subject as data controllers to laws governing their use of personal data including in relation to their employees clients and recipients of their services these laws currently take the form of the uk’s data protection act 2018 and the european union’s “eu” general data protection regulation “gdpr” among other laws the data protection act and the gdpr impose a significant number of new obligations with the potential for fines of up to 4 of annual worldwide turnover or €20 million whichever is greater entities incorporated in or carrying on a business in the uk as well as individuals residing in the uk are also subject to the uk bribery act 2010 the uk has recently introduced a new 

national minimum wage legislation with a maximum fine for nonpayment of £20000 per worker and employers who fail to pay will be banned from being a company director for up to 15 years the uk recently voted to exit from the eu “brexit” negotiations on the exit agreement are underway but at present it is not possible to predict whether brexit will have a material impact on our operators’ or tenants’ property or business 

canada 

retirement homes and longterm care homes are subject to regulation and longterm care homes receive funding under provincial law there is no federal regulation in this area set out below are summaries of the principal regulatory requirements in the provinces where we have a material number of facilities 

licensing and regulation 

alberta 

in alberta there are three relevant designations for seniors’ living arrangements ordered below from the most independent to the highest level of care 

 ontario 

retirement homes are regulated and licensed under a provincial law aimed at protecting residents retirement homes do not receive government funding residents enter into tenancy agreements under provincial tenancy law and pay for tenancy and services received residents may access publiclyfunded external care services at the home from external suppliers retirement home licenses are granted by the retirement homes regulatory authority “rhra” and are nontransferable the rhra administers the law governing retirement homes to ensure that licensees are meeting certain standards generally with respect to care and safety the law requires any person to report to the rhra when there are reasonable grounds to suspect abuse of a resident by anyone or neglect of a resident by staff the rhra conducts a mandatory inspection and issues a report that is posted on the rhra’s public website and also must be posted in the subject home if it is the most recent report the registrar of the rhra can receive complaints about a retirement home contravening a provision of the law and if such a complaint is received it must be reviewed promptly the registrar has broad powers relating to complaint investigation and action the rhra registrar has the power to inspect a retirement home at any time without warning or issue a warrant to ensure compliance compliance inspections occur at least every three years the registrar has the power to make a variety of orders including the imposition of a fine or an order revoking the operator’s license the applicable law also enumerates offenses such as operating without a license and provides for penalties for offenses 

british columbia 

provincial laws regulate and license “community care facilities” longterm care homes in substantially the same manner as retirement homes are regulated under ontario laws community care facilities are defined as premises used for the purpose of supervising vulnerable persons who require three or more prescribed services from a list that includes regular assistance with activities of daily living distribution of medication management of cash resources monitoring of food intake structured behavior management and intervention and psychosocial or physical rehabilitative therapy 

provincial law also recognizes and regulates “assisted living residences” for seniors who can live independently but require assistance with certain activities services available can include meals housekeeping monitoring and emergency support socialrecreational opportunities and transportation assisted living residences do not require a license but must be registered with the registrar of assisted living residences and must be operated in a manner that does not jeopardize the health or safety of residents if the registrar believes the standard is not being met the registrar may inspect the residence and may suspend or cancel a registration independent living residences offer housing and hospitality services for retired adults who are functionally independent and able to direct their own care 

québec 

provincial laws in québec regulate retirement homes private seniors’ residences as well as longterm care homes residential and longterm care centers private seniors’ residences are required to obtain a certificate of compliance based on prescribed operating standards a certificate of compliance is issued for a period of four years and is renewable the regional health and social agency may revoke or refuse to issue or renew a certificate of compliance if among other things the operator fails to comply with the applicable law the agency may also order corrective measures further to an inspection complaint or investigation the agency is authorized to inspect a residence at any reasonable time of day in order to ascertain whether it complies with the law 

private seniors’ residences may belong to either or both of the following categories i those offering services to independent elderly persons and ii those offering services to semiindependent elderly persons the operator must for each category comply with the applicable criteria and standards with some exceptions for residences with fewer than six or ten rooms or apartments there are requirements with respect to residents’ health and safety meal services and recreation content of residents’ files disclosure of information to residents and staffing among other things 

in may 2017 quebec adopted the act to combat maltreatment of seniors and other persons of full age in vulnerable situations  which aims to implement a quebecwide framework agreement to combat maltreatment targets all facilities that provide health services and social services to seniors and vulnerable persons including health establishments and private residences we expect that it will affect private seniors’ residences in the following ways 

 other related laws 

privacy 

the services provided in our facilities are subject to privacy legislation in canada including in certain provinces privacy laws specifically related to personal health information although the obligations of custodians of personal information in the various provinces differ they all include the obligation to protect the information the organizations with which we have management agreements may be the custodian of personal information collected in connection with the operation of our facilities 

privacy laws in canada are consentbased and require the implementation of a privacy program involving policies procedures and the designation of an individual or team with primary responsibility for privacy law compliance mandatory breach notification to affected individuals is a requirement under some laws mandatory breach notification to the applicable regulator is a requirement in some provinces some laws require notification where personal information is processed or stored outside of canada one provincial law in quebec provides for fines where an organization fails to perform due diligence before outsourcing activities involving personal information to a service provider outside of the province 

the powers of privacy regulators and penalties for violations of privacy law vary according to the applicable law or are left to the courts to date monetary penalties granted have been on the low side although that is changing with civil actions for breach of privacy and may change further as a result of class action activity there are over 60 privacy class actions which have been filed in canada over recent years although none have yet been decided on their merits regulators have the authority to make public 

the identity of a custodian that has been found to have committed a breach so there is a reputational risk associated with privacy law violations even where no monetary damages are incurred the notification of residents mandatory under some privacy laws and other activities required to manage a privacy breach can give rise to significant costs 

other legislation 

retirement homes may be subject to residential tenancy laws such that there can be restrictions on rent increases and termination of tenancies for instance other provincial andor municipal laws applicable to fire safety food services zoning occupational health and safety public health and the provision of community health care and funded longtermpostacute care may also apply to retirement homes   

taxation 

the following summary of the taxation of the company and the material us federal income tax consequences to the holders of our debt and equity securities is for general information only and is not tax advice this summary does not address all aspects of taxation that may be relevant to certain types of holders of stock or securities including but not limited to insurance companies taxexempt entities financial institutions or brokerdealers persons holding shares of common stock as part of a hedging integrated conversion or constructive sale transaction or a straddle traders in securities that use a marktomarket method of accounting for their securities investors in passthrough entities and foreign corporations and persons who are not citizens or residents of the united states 

this summary does not discuss all of the aspects of us federal income taxation that may be relevant to you in light of your particular investment or other circumstances in addition this summary does not discuss any state or local income taxation or foreign income taxation or other foreign tax consequences this summary is based on current us federal income tax law including the provisions of the “tax cuts and jobs act” the “tax act” a discussion of the potential implications to the company of the tax act is provided at the end of this summary below subsequent developments in us federal income tax law including changes in law or differing interpretations which may be applied retroactively could have a material effect on the us federal income tax consequences of purchasing owning and disposing of our securities as set forth in this summary before you purchase our securities you should consult your own tax advisor regarding the particular us federal state local foreign and other tax consequences of acquiring owning and selling our securities 

general 

we elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust a “reit” commencing with our first taxable year we intend to continue to operate in such a manner as to qualify as a reit but there is no guarantee that we will qualify or remain qualified as a reit for subsequent years qualification and taxation as a reit depends upon our ability to meet a variety of qualification tests imposed under us federal income tax law with respect to our income assets distributions and share ownership as discussed below under “qualification as a reit” there can be no assurance that we will qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

in any year in which we qualify as a reit in general we will not be subject to us federal income tax on that portion of our reit taxable income or capital gain that is distributed to stockholders we may however be subject to tax at normal corporate rates on any taxable income or capital gain not distributed if we elect to retain and pay income tax on our net capital gain stockholders would be taxed on their proportionate share of our undistributed net capital gain and would receive a refundable credit for their share of any taxes paid by us on such gain 

despite the reit election we may be subject to us federal income and excise tax as follows 



of the 75 gross income test discussed below or ii 95 of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 95 gross income test discussed below multiplied by 2 a fraction intended to reflect our profitability 

 if we acquire any assets from a corporation which is or has been a “c” corporation in a carryover basis transaction including where a “c” corporation elects reit status we could be liable for specified liabilities that are inherited from the “c” corporation a “c” corporation is generally defined as a corporation that is required to pay full corporate level us federal income tax if we recognize gain on the disposition of the assets during the fiveyear period beginning on the date on which the assets were acquired by us then to the extent of the assets’ “builtin gain” ie the excess of the fair market value of the asset over the adjusted tax basis in the asset in each case determined as of the beginning of the fiveyear period we will be subject to tax on the gain at the highest regular corporate rate applicable the results described in this paragraph with respect to the recognition of builtin gain assume that the “c” corporation did not make and was not treated as making an election to treat the builtin gain assets as sold to an unrelated party for those properties that are subject to the builtin gains tax the potential amount of builtin gains tax will be an additional factor when considering a possible sale of the properties within the fiveyear period beginning on the date on which the properties were acquired by us see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the builtin gains tax 

qualification as a reit 

a reit is defined as a corporation trust or association 

 taxable year 

 its first taxable year directly indirectly or constructively by or for five or fewer individuals which includes certain 

entities the “five or fewer requirement” and 

 

conditions 1 to 4 inclusive must be met during the entire taxable year and condition 5 must be met during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months for purposes of conditions 5 and 6 pension funds and certain other taxexempt entities are treated as individuals subject to a “lookthrough” exception in the case of condition 6 

based on publicly available information we believe we have satisfied the share ownership requirements set forth in 5 and 6 above in addition article vi of our bylaws provides for restrictions regarding ownership and transfer of shares these restrictions are intended to assist us in continuing to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in 5 and 6 above but may not ensure that we will in all cases be able to satisfy such requirements 

we have complied with and will continue to comply with regulatory rules to send annual letters to certain of our stockholders requesting information regarding the actual ownership of our stock if despite sending the annual letters we do not know or after exercising reasonable diligence would not have known whether we failed to meet the five or fewer requirement we will be treated as having met the five or fewer requirement if we fail to comply with these regulatory rules we will be subject to a monetary penalty if our failure to comply were due to intentional disregard of the requirement the penalty would be increased however if our failure to comply were due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect no penalty would be imposed 

we may own a number of properties through wholly owned subsidiaries a corporation will qualify as a “qualified reit subsidiary” if 100 of its stock is owned by a reit and the reit does not elect to treat the subsidiary as a taxable reit subsidiary a “qualified reit subsidiary” will not be treated as a separate corporation for us federal income tax purposes and all assets liabilities and items of income deductions and credits of a “qualified reit subsidiary” will be treated as assets liabilities and items as the case may be of the reit for us federal income tax purposes a “qualified reit subsidiary” is not subject to us 

federal income tax and our ownership of the voting stock of a qualified reit subsidiary will not violate the restrictions against ownership of securities of any one issuer which constitute more than 10 of the value or total voting power of such issuer or more than 5 of the value of our total assets as described below under “ asset tests” 

if we invest in an entity treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes we will be deemed to own a proportionate share of the entity’s assets likewise we will be treated as receiving our share of the income and loss of the entity and the gross income will retain the same character in our hands as it has in the hands of the entity these “lookthrough” rules apply for purposes of the income tests and assets tests described below 

the deduction of business interest is limited to 30 of adjusted taxable income which may limit the deductibility of interest expense by us our taxable reit subsidiaries or our joint venture and partnership arrangements a “real property trade or business” may irrevocably elect out of the applicability of the limitation but if it does so it must use the less favorable alternative depreciation system to depreciate real property used in the trade or business proposed regulations provide guidance on how to allocate interest deductions among multiple trades or businesses and contain special rules including a safe harbor regarding the allocation of a reit’s interest deductions to a “real property trade or business” 

income tests there are two separate percentage tests relating to our sources of gross income that we must satisfy each taxable year 

 

income from hedging and foreign currency transactions is excluded from the 95 and 75 gross income tests if certain requirements are met but otherwise will constitute gross income which does not qualify under the 95 or 75 gross income tests 

rents received by us will qualify as “rents from real property” for purposes of satisfying the gross income tests for a reit only if several conditions are met 

 

a reit is permitted to render a de minimis amount of impermissible services to tenants and still treat amounts received with respect to that property as rent from real property the amount received or accrued by the reit during the taxable year for the impermissible services with respect to a property may not exceed 1 of all amounts received or accrued by the reit directly or indirectly from the property the amount received for any service or management operation for this purpose shall be deemed to be not less than 150 of the direct cost of the reit in furnishing or rendering the service or providing the management or operation furthermore impermissible services may be furnished to tenants by a taxable reit subsidiary subject to certain conditions which would permit us to still treat rents received with respect to the property as rent from real property 

the term “interest” generally does not include any amount if the determination of the amount depends in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person although an amount generally will not be excluded from the term “interest” solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage of receipts or sales 

if we fail to satisfy one or both of the 75 or 95 gross income tests for any taxable year we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for such year if we are eligible for certain relief provisions provided by the internal revenue code these relief provisions generally will be available if 1 following our identification of the failure we file a schedule for such taxable year describing each item of our gross income and 2 the failure to meet such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect it is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions if these relief provisions apply a 100 tax is imposed on an amount equal to a the gross income attributable to 1 75 of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75 income test and 2 95 of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 95 income test multiplied by b a fraction intended to reflect our profitability the secretary of the treasury is given broad authority to determine whether particular items of income or gain qualify under the 75 and 95 gross income tests and to exclude items from the measure of gross income for such purposes 

asset tests   within 30 days after the close of each quarter of our taxable year we must also satisfy several tests relating to the nature and diversification of our assets determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles at least 75 of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets including interests in real property interests in mortgages on real property or on interests in real property shares in other reits and debt instruments issued by publicly offered reits cash cash items including receivables arising in the ordinary course of our operation government securities and qualified temporary investments although the remaining 25 of our assets generally may be invested without restriction we are prohibited from owning securities representing more than 10 of either the vote the “10 vote test” or value the “10 value test” of the outstanding securities of any issuer other than a qualified reit subsidiary another reit or a taxable reit subsidiary further no more than 20 of our total assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries the “20 asset test” and no more than 5 of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities of any nongovernmental issuer other than a qualified reit subsidiary the “5 asset test” another reit or a taxable reit subsidiary each of the 10 vote test the 10 value test and the 20 and 5 asset tests must be satisfied at the end of each quarter there are special rules which provide relief if the valuerelated tests are not satisfied due to changes in the value of the assets of a reit 

certain items are excluded from the 10 value test including 1 straight debt securities meeting certain requirements 2 any loan to an individual or an estate 3 any rental agreement described in section 467 of the internal revenue code other than with a “related person” 4 any obligation to pay rents from real property 5 certain securities issued by a state or any subdivision thereof the district of columbia a foreign government or any political subdivision thereof or the commonwealth of puerto rico 6 any security issued by a reit and 7 any other arrangement that as determined by the secretary of the treasury is excepted from the definition of security “excluded securities” if a reit or its taxable reit subsidiary holds 1 straight debt securities of a corporate or partnership issuer and 2 securities of such issuer that are not excluded securities and have an aggregate value greater than 1 of such issuer’s outstanding securities the straight debt securities will be included in the 10 value test 

a reit’s interest as a partner in a partnership is not treated as a security for purposes of applying the 10 value test to securities issued by the partnership further any debt instrument issued by a partnership that is not an excluded security will not be a security for purposes of applying the 10 value test 1 to the extent of the reit’s interest as a partner in the partnership or 2 if at least 75 of the partnership’s gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions would qualify for the 75 gross income test for purposes of the 10 value test a reit’s interest in a partnership’s assets is determined by the reit’s proportionate interest in any securities issued by the partnership other than the excluded securities described in the preceding paragraph 

for taxable years beginning after july 30 2008 if the reit or its “qualified business unit” uses a foreign currency as its functional currency the term “cash” includes such foreign currency but only to the extent such foreign currency is i held for use in the normal course of the activities of the reit or “qualified business unit” which give rise to items of income or gain that are included in the 95 and 75 gross income tests or are directly related to acquiring or holding assets qualifying under the 75 asset test and ii not held in connection with dealing or engaging in substantial and regular trading in securities 

with respect to corrections of failures as to violations of the 10 vote test the 10 value test or the 5 asset test a reit may avoid disqualification as a reit by disposing of sufficient assets to cure a violation that does not exceed the lesser of 1 of the reit’s assets at the end of the relevant quarter or 10000000 provided that the disposition occurs within six months following the last day of the quarter in which the reit first identified the assets for violations of any of the reit asset tests due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that exceed the thresholds described in the preceding sentence a reit can avoid disqualification as a reit after the close of a taxable quarter by taking certain steps including disposition of sufficient assets within the six month period described above to meet the applicable asset test paying a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets during the period of time that the assets were held as nonqualifying assets and filing a schedule with the internal revenue service that describes the nonqualifying assets 

investments in taxable reit subsidiaries reits may own more than 10 of the voting power and value of securities in taxable reit subsidiaries unlike a qualified reit subsidiary other disregarded entity or partnership the income and assets of a taxable reit subsidiary are not attributable to the reit for purposes of satisfying the income and asset ownership requirements applicable to reit qualification we and any taxable corporate entity in which we own an interest are allowed to jointly elect to treat such entity as a “taxable reit subsidiary” 

certain of our subsidiaries have elected taxable reit subsidiary status taxable reit subsidiaries are subject to full corporate level us federal taxation on their earnings but are permitted to engage in certain types of activities that cannot be performed directly by reits without jeopardizing their reit status our taxable reit subsidiaries will attempt to minimize the amount of these taxes but there can be no assurance whether or the extent to which measures taken to minimize taxes will be successful to the extent our taxable reit subsidiaries are required to pay us federal state or local taxes the cash available for distribution as dividends to us from our taxable reit subsidiaries will be reduced 

the internal revenue service may redetermine amounts from transactions between a reit and its taxable reit subsidiary where there is a lack of arm’slength dealing between the parties any taxable income allocated to or deductible expenses allocated away from a taxable reit subsidiary would increase its tax liability further certain amounts from certain transactions involving a reit and its taxable reit subsidiaries could be subject to a 100 tax if not conducted on an arm’s length basis additional taxable reit subsidiary elections may be made in the future for additional entities in which we obtain an interest 

annual distribution requirements in order to avoid being taxed as a regular corporation we are required to make distributions other than capital gain distributions to our stockholders which qualify for the dividends paid deduction in an amount at least equal to 1 the sum of i 90 of our “reit taxable income” computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain and ii 90 of the aftertax net income if any from foreclosure property minus 2 a portion of certain items of noncash income these distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for that year and if paid on or before the first regular distribution payment after such declaration prior to 2014 with respect to all reits the amount distributed could not be preferential this means that every stockholder of the class of stock to which a distribution is made must be treated the same as every other stockholder of that class and no class of stock may be treated otherwise than in accordance with its dividend rights as a class the “preferential dividend rule” beginning in tax years after 2014 the preferential dividend rule no longer applies to publicly offered reits however the rule is still applicable to other entities taxed as reits which would include several of our subsidiaries to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our “reit taxable income” as adjusted we will be subject to tax on the undistributed amount at regular corporate tax rates as discussed above we may be subject to an excise tax if we fail to meet certain other distribution requirements we believe we have satisfied the annual distribution requirements for the year of our initial reit election and each year thereafter through the year ended december 31 2018 although we intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy these annual distribution requirements for subsequent years economic market legal tax or other factors could limit our ability to meet those requirements see “item 1a  risk factors” 

it is also possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90 distribution requirement or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation due to among other things 1 timing differences between i the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses and ii the inclusion of income and deduction of expenses in arriving at our taxable income or 2 the payment of severance benefits that may not be deductible to us in the event that timing differences occur we may find it necessary to arrange for borrowings or if possible pay dividends in the form of taxable stock dividends in order to meet the distribution requirement 

under certain circumstances including in the event of a deficiency determined by the internal revenue service we may be able to rectify a resulting failure to meet the distribution requirement for a year by paying “deficiency dividends” to stockholders in a later year which may be included in our deduction for distributions paid for the earlier year thus we may be able to avoid being disqualified as a reit andor taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends however we will be required to pay applicable penalties and interest based upon the amount of any deduction taken for deficiency dividend distributions 

failure to qualify as a reit 

if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to us federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates distributions to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify as a reit will not be deductible nor will any particular amount of distributions be required to be made in any year all distributions to stockholders will be taxable as dividends to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these distributions and subject to certain limitations will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporate stockholders unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions we also will be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to statutory relief failure to qualify for even one year could result in our need to incur indebtedness or liquidate investments in order to pay potentially significant resulting tax liabilities 

in addition to the relief described above under “income tests” and “asset tests” relief is available in the event that we violate a provision of the internal revenue code that would result in our failure to qualify as a reit if 1 the violation is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect 2 we pay a penalty of 50000 for each failure to satisfy the provision and 3 the violation does not include a violation described under “income tests” or “asset tests” above it is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions 

us federal income taxation of holders of our stock 

treatment of taxable us stockholders the following summary applies to you only if you are a “us stockholder” a “us stockholder” is a holder of shares of stock who for us federal income tax purposes is 

 so long as we qualify for taxation as a reit distributions on shares of our stock made out of the current or accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these distributions and not designated as capital gain dividends will be taxable as dividends for us federal income tax purposes none of these distributions will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for us corporate stockholders 

generally the current maximum marginal rate of tax payable by individuals on dividends received from corporations that are subject to a corporate level of tax is 20 except in limited circumstances this tax rate will not apply to dividends paid to you by us on our shares because generally we are not subject to us federal income tax on the portion of our reit taxable income or capital gains distributed to our stockholders the reduced maximum us federal income tax rate will apply to that portion if any of dividends received by you with respect to our shares that are attributable to 1 dividends received by us from nonreit corporations or other taxable reit subsidiaries 2 income from the prior year with respect to which we were required to pay us federal corporate income tax during the prior year if for example we did not distribute 100 of our reit taxable income for the prior year or 3 the amount of any earnings and profits that were distributed by us and accumulated in a nonreit year 

although the preferential 20 rate on qualified dividends is generally not applicable to dividends to our shareholders the tax act provides for a deduction from income for individuals trusts and estates for 20 of taxable reit dividends not eligible for the preferential rate excluding capital gain dividends this deduction is not taken into account for purposes of determining the 38 tax on net investment income described below and unlike the preferential rate expires after 2025 

distributions that are designated as capital gain dividends will be taxed as longterm capital gains to the extent they do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year without regard to the period for which you held our stock however if you are a corporation you may be required to treat a portion of some capital gain dividends as ordinary income 

if we elect to retain and pay income tax on any net capital gain and designate such amount in a timely notice to you you would include in income as longterm capital gain your proportionate share of this net capital gain you would also receive a refundable 

tax credit for your proportionate share of the tax paid by us on such retained capital gains and you would have an increase in the basis of your shares of our stock in an amount equal to your includable capital gains less your share of the tax deemed paid 

you may not include in your us federal income tax return any of our net operating losses or capital losses us federal income tax rules may also require that certain minimum tax adjustments and preferences be apportioned to you in addition any distribution declared by us in october november or december of any year on a specified date in any such month shall be treated as both paid by us and received by you on december 31 of that year provided that the distribution is actually paid by us no later than january 31 of the following year 

we will be treated as having sufficient earnings and profits to treat as a dividend any distribution up to the amount required to be distributed in order to avoid imposition of the 4 excise tax discussed under “general” and “qualification as a reit  annual distribution requirements” above as a result you may be required to treat as taxable dividends certain distributions that would otherwise result in a taxfree return of capital moreover any “deficiency dividend” will be treated as a dividend an ordinary dividend or a capital gain dividend as the case may be regardless of our earnings and profits any other distributions in excess of current or accumulated earnings and profits will generally not be taxable to you to the extent these distributions do not exceed the adjusted tax basis of your shares of our stock you will be required to reduce the tax basis of your shares of our stock by the amount of these distributions until the basis has been reduced to zero after which these distributions will be taxable as capital gain if the shares of our stock are held as capital assets the tax basis as so reduced will be used in computing the capital gain or loss if any realized upon the sale of the shares of our stock any loss upon a sale or exchange of shares of our stock which were held for six months or less after application of certain holding period rules will generally be treated as a longterm capital loss to the extent you previously received capital gain distributions with respect to these shares of our stock 

upon the sale or exchange of any shares of our stock to or with a person other than us or a sale or exchange of all shares of our stock whether actually or constructively owned with us you will generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your adjusted tax basis in these shares of our stock this gain or loss will be capital gain or loss if you held these shares of our stock as a capital asset 

if we redeem any of your shares in us the treatment can only be determined on the basis of particular facts at the time of redemption in general you will recognize gain or loss as opposed to dividend income equal to the difference between the amount received by you in the redemption and your adjusted tax basis in your shares redeemed if such redemption 1 results in a “complete termination” of your interest in all classes of our equity securities 2 is a “substantially disproportionate redemption” or 3 is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” with respect to you in applying these tests you must take into account your ownership of all classes of our equity securities eg common stock preferred stock depositary shares and warrants you also must take into account any equity securities that are considered to be constructively owned by you 

if as a result of a redemption by us of your shares you no longer own either actually or constructively any of our equity securities or only own actually and constructively an insubstantial percentage of our equity securities then it is probable that the redemption of your shares would be considered “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” and thus would result in gain or loss to you however whether a distribution is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” depends on all of the facts and circumstances and if you rely on any of these tests at the time of redemption you should consult your tax advisor to determine their application to the particular situation 

generally if the redemption does not meet the tests described above then the proceeds received by you from the redemption of your shares will be treated as a distribution taxable as a dividend to the extent of the allocable portion of current or accumulated earnings and profits if the redemption is taxed as a dividend your adjusted tax basis in the redeemed shares will be transferred to any other shareholdings in us that you own if you own no other shareholdings in us under certain circumstances such basis may be transferred to a related person or it may be lost entirely 

gain from the sale or exchange of our shares held for more than one year is generally taxed at a maximum longterm capital gain rate of 20 in the case of stockholders who are individuals and 21 in the case of stockholders that are corporations pursuant to internal revenue service guidance we may classify portions of our capital gain dividends as eligible for specific treatment provided under the internal revenue code which depending on the nature of the capital gains may result in taxation of such portions at rates of either 20 or 25 capital losses recognized by a stockholder upon the disposition of our shares held for more than one year at the time of disposition will be considered longterm capital losses the deduction for capital losses is subject to limitations 

an additional tax of 38 generally will be imposed on the “net investment income” of us stockholders who meet certain requirements and are individuals estates or certain trusts among other items “net investment income” generally includes gross income from dividends and net gain attributable to the disposition of certain property such as shares of our common stock or 

warrants in the case of individuals this tax will only apply to the extent such individual’s modified adjusted gross income exceeds 200000 250000 for married couples filing a joint return and surviving spouses and 125000 for married individuals filing a separate return us stockholders should consult their tax advisors regarding the possible applicability of this additional tax in their particular circumstances 

treatment of taxexempt us stockholders taxexempt entities including qualified employee pension and profit sharing trusts and individual retirement accounts “exempt organizations” generally are exempt from us federal income taxation however they are subject to taxation on their unrelated business taxable income “ubti” the internal revenue service has issued a published revenue ruling that dividend distributions from a reit to an exempt employee pension trust do not constitute ubti provided that the shares of the reit are not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business of the exempt employee pension trust based on this ruling amounts distributed by us to exempt organizations generally should not constitute ubti however if an exempt organization finances its acquisition of the shares of our stock with debt a portion of its income from us will constitute ubti pursuant to the “debt financed property” rules likewise a portion of the exempt organization’s income from us would constitute ubti if we held a residual interest in a real estate mortgage investment conduit a taxexempt us stockholder that is subject to tax on its ubti will be required to segregate its taxable income and loss for each unrelated trade or business activity for purposes of determining its ubti 

backup withholding and information reporting under certain circumstances you may be subject to backup withholding at applicable rates on payments made with respect to or cash proceeds of a sale or exchange of shares of our stock backup withholding will apply only if you 1 fail to provide a correct taxpayer identification number which if you are an individual is ordinarily your social security number 2 furnish an incorrect taxpayer identification number 3 are notified by the internal revenue service that you have failed to properly report payments of interest or dividends or 4 fail to certify under penalties of perjury that you have furnished a correct taxpayer identification number and that the internal revenue service has not notified you that you are subject to backup withholding 

backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients such as corporations and taxexempt organizations you should consult with a tax advisor regarding qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining an exemption backup withholding is not an additional tax rather the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a stockholder will be allowed as a credit against such stockholder’s us federal income tax liability and may entitle such stockholder to a refund provided that the required information is provided to the internal revenue service in addition withholding a portion of capital gain distributions made to stockholders may be required for stockholders who fail to certify their nonforeign status 

taxation of foreign stockholders the following summary applies to you only if you are a foreign person a “foreign person” is a holder of shares of stock who for us federal income tax purposes is not a us stockholder the us federal taxation of foreign persons is a highly complex matter that may be affected by many considerations 

except as discussed below distributions to you of cash generated by our real estate operations in the form of ordinary dividends but not by the sale or exchange of our capital assets generally will be subject to us withholding tax at a rate of 30 unless an applicable tax treaty reduces that tax and you file with us the required form evidencing the lower rate 

in general you will be subject to us federal income tax on a graduated rate basis rather than withholding with respect to your investment in our stock if such investment is “effectively connected” with your conduct of a trade or business in the united states a corporate foreign stockholder that receives income that is or is treated as effectively connected with a united states trade or business may also be subject to the branch profits tax which is payable in addition to regular united states corporate income tax the following discussion will apply to foreign stockholders whose investment in us is not so effectively connected we expect to withhold united states income tax as described below on the gross amount of any distributions paid to you unless 1 you file an internal revenue service form w8eci with us claiming that the distribution is “effectively connected” or 2 certain other exceptions apply 

distributions by us that are attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a united states real property interest will be taxed to you under the foreign investment in real property tax act of 1980 “firpta” as if these distributions were gains “effectively connected” with a united states trade or business accordingly you will be taxed at the normal capital gain rates applicable to a us stockholder on these amounts subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals distributions subject to firpta may also be subject to a branch profits tax in the hands of a corporate foreign stockholder that is not entitled to treaty exemption we will be required to withhold tax at a rate of 21 from distributions subject to firpta we will be required to withhold from distributions subject to firpta and remit to the internal revenue service 21 of designated capital gain dividends or if greater 21 of the amount of any distributions that could be designated as capital gain dividends in addition if we designate prior distributions as capital gain dividends subsequent 

distributions up to the amount of the prior distributions not withheld against will be treated as capital gain dividends for purposes of withholding 

any capital gain dividend with respect to any class of stock that is “regularly traded” on an established securities market will be treated as an ordinary dividend if the foreign stockholder did not own more than 10 of such class of stock at any time during the taxable year foreign stockholders generally will not be required to report distributions received from us on us federal income tax returns and all distributions treated as dividends for us federal income tax purposes including any such capital gain dividends will be subject to a 30 us withholding tax unless reduced under an applicable income tax treaty as discussed above in addition the branch profits tax will not apply to such distributions 

unless our shares constitute a “united states real property interest” within the meaning of firpta or are effectively connected with a us trade or business a sale of our shares by you generally will not be subject to united states taxation even if our shares were to constitute a “united states real property interest” nonus stockholders that are “qualified foreign pension funds” or are owned by a qualified foreign pension fund meeting certain requirements may be exempt from firpta withholding on the sale or disposition of our shares our shares will not constitute a united states real property interest if we qualify as a “domestically controlled reit” we believe that we qualify as and expect to continue to qualify as a domestically controlled reit a domestically controlled reit is a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50 in value of its shares is held directly or indirectly by foreign stockholders generally we are permitted to assume that holders of less than 5 of our shares at all times during a specified testing period are us persons however if you are a nonresident alien individual who is present in the united states for 183 days or more during the taxable year and certain other conditions apply you will be subject to a 30 tax on such capital gains in any event a purchaser of our shares from you will not be required under firpta to withhold on the purchase price if the purchased shares are “regularly traded” on an established securities market or if we are a domestically controlled reit otherwise under firpta the purchaser may be required to withhold 15 of the purchase price and remit such amount to the internal revenue service

state local and foreign taxes 

we and holders of our debt and equity securities may be subject to state local or foreign taxation in various jurisdictions including those in which we or they transact business own property or reside it should be noted that we own properties located in a number of state local and foreign jurisdictions and may be required to file tax returns in some or all of those jurisdictions the state local or foreign tax treatment of us and holders of our debt and equity securities may not conform to the us federal income tax consequences discussed above consequently you are urged to consult your advisor regarding the application and effect of state local and foreign tax laws with respect to any investment in our securities 

changes in applicable tax regulations could negatively affect our financial results

 item 1a risk factors 

this section discusses the most significant factors that affect our business operations and financial condition it does not describe all risks and uncertainties applicable to us our industry or ownership of our securities if any of the following risks as well as other risks and uncertainties that are not addressed in this section or that we have not yet identified actually occur we could be materially adversely affected and the value of our securities could decline we group these risk factors into three categories 

 risks arising from our business 

our investments in and acquisitions of health care and seniors housing properties may be unsuccessful or fail to meet our expectations   

we are exposed to the risk that some of our acquisitions may not prove to be successful we could encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired properties including contingent liabilities and acquired properties might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business if we agree to provide construction funding to an operatortenant and the project is not completed we may need to take steps to ensure completion of the project such expenditures may negatively affect our results of operations investments in and acquisitions of seniors housing and health care properties entail risks associated with real estate investments generally including risks that the investment will not achieve expected returns that the cost estimates for necessary property improvements will prove inaccurate or that the tenant operator or manager will fail to meet performance expectations furthermore there can be no assurance that our anticipated acquisitions and investments the completion of which is subject to various conditions will be consummated in accordance with 

anticipated timing on anticipated terms or at all health care properties are often highly customizable and the development or redevelopment of such properties may require costly tenantspecific improvements we also may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties into our existing operations and this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition as a result we cannot assure you that we will achieve the economic benefit we expect from acquisitions investment development and redevelopment opportunities all of the foregoing could affect our ability to continue paying dividends at the current rate   

our investments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by our lack of exclusive control over these investments our partners’ insolvency or failure to meet their obligations and disputes between us and our partners   

we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into partnerships or joint ventures with other persons or entities joint venture investments involve risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership including the possibility that our partner might become insolvent refuse to make capital contributions when due or otherwise fail to meet its obligations which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments that our partner might at any time have economic or other business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our interests or goals that we could become engaged in a dispute with our partner which could require us to expend additional resources to resolve such dispute and could have an adverse impact on the operations and profitability of the joint venture and that our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests in addition our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted in some instances we andor our partner may have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partner’s interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction our ability to acquire our partner’s interest may be limited if we do not have sufficient cash available borrowing capacity or other capital resources in such event we may be forced to sell our interest in the joint venture when we would otherwise prefer to retain it joint ventures may require us to share decisionmaking authority with our partners which could limit our ability to control the properties in the joint ventures even when we have a controlling interest certain major decisions may require partner approval such as the sale acquisition or financing of a property   

we are exposed to operational risks with respect to our seniors housing operating properties that could adversely affect our revenue and operations 

we are exposed to various operational risks with respect to our seniors housing operating properties that may increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to generate revenues these risks include fluctuations in occupancy medicare and medicaid reimbursement if applicable and private pay rates economic conditions competition federal state local and industryregulated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards the availability and increases in cost of general and professional liability insurance coverage state regulation and rights of residents related to entrance fees and the availability and increases in the cost of labor as a result of unionization or otherwise any one or a combination of these factors may adversely affect our revenue and operations 

decreases in our operators’ revenues or increases in our operators’ expenses could affect our operators’ ability to make payments to us 

our operators’ revenues are primarily driven by occupancy private pay rates and medicare and medicaid reimbursement if applicable expenses for these facilities are primarily driven by the costs of labor food utilities taxes insurance and rent or debt service revenues from government reimbursement have and may continue to come under pressure due to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls operating costs continue to increase for our operators to the extent that any decrease in revenues andor any increase in operating expenses result in a property not generating enough cash to make payments to us the credit of our operator and the value of other collateral would have to be relied upon to the extent the value of such property is reduced we may need to record an impairment for such asset furthermore if we determine to dispose of an underperforming property such sale may result in a loss any such impairment or loss on sale would negatively affect our financial results all of the foregoing could affect our ability to continue paying dividends at the current rate 

increased competition and oversupply may affect our operators’ ability to meet their obligations to us   

the operators of our properties compete on a local and regional basis with operators of properties and other health care providers that provide comparable services for residents and patients including on the basis of the scope and quality of care and services provided reputation and financial condition physical appearance of the properties price and location our operators are expected to encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to attract residents or expand their businesses in addition we expect that there will continue to be a more than adequate inventory of seniors housing facilities we cannot be certain that the operators of all of our facilities will be able to achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us if our operators cannot compete effectively or if there is an oversupply of facilities their financial performance and ability to meet their obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our financial results   

a severe cold and flu season epidemics or any other widespread illnesses could adversely affect the occupancy of our seniors housing operating and triplenet properties 

our revenues and our operators’ revenues are dependent on occupancy it is impossible to predict the severity of the cold and flu season or the occurrence of epidemics or any other widespread illnesses the occupancy of our seniors housing operating and triplenet properties could significantly decrease in the event of a severe cold and flu season an epidemic or any other widespread illness such a decrease could affect the operating income of our seniors housing operating properties and the ability of our triplenet operators to make payments to us in addition a flu pandemic could significantly increase the cost burdens faced by our operators including if they are required to implement quarantines for residents and adversely affect their ability to meet their obligations to us which would have a material adverse effect on our financial results   

the insolvency or bankruptcy of our tenants operators borrowers managers and other obligors may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition   

we are exposed to the risk that our tenants operators borrowers managers or other obligors may not be able to meet the rent principal and interest or other payments due us which may result in a tenant operator borrower manager or other obligor bankruptcy or insolvency or that a tenant operator borrower manager or other obligor might become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings for other reasons although our operating lease agreements provide us with the right to evict a tenant demand immediate payment of rent and exercise other remedies and our loans provide us with the right to terminate any funding obligation demand immediate repayment of principal and unpaid interest foreclose on the collateral and exercise other remedies the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization a tenant operator borrower manager or other obligor in bankruptcy or subject to insolvency proceedings may be able to limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent in the case of a lease or to receive unpaid principal and interest in the case of a loan and to exercise other rights and remedies in addition if a lease is rejected in a tenant bankruptcy our claim against the tenant may be limited by applicable provisions of the bankruptcy law we may be required to fund certain expenses eg real estate taxes and maintenance to preserve the value of an investment property avoid the imposition of liens on a property andor transition a property to a new tenant in some instances we have terminated our lease with a tenant and relet the property to another tenant in some of those situations we have provided working capital loans to and limited indemnification of the new obligor if we cannot transition a leased property to a new tenant we may take possession of that property which may expose us to certain successor liabilities should such events occur our revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely affected all of the foregoing could affect our ability to continue paying dividends at the current rate   

we may not be able to timely reinvest our sale proceeds on terms acceptable to us   

from time to time we will have cash available from the proceeds of sales of our securities principal payments on our loans receivable or the sale of properties including nonelective dispositions under the terms of master leases or similar financial support arrangements in order to maintain current revenues and continue generating attractive returns we expect to reinvest these proceeds in a timely manner we compete for real estate investments with a broad variety of potential investors including other health care reits real estate partnerships health care providers health care lenders and other investors including developers banks insurance companies pension funds governmentsponsored entities and private equity firms some of whom may have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do this competition for attractive investments may negatively affect our ability to make timely investments on terms acceptable to us   

the properties managed by sunrise senior living llc “sunrise” account for a significant portion of our revenues and net operating income and any adverse developments in its business or financial condition could adversely affect us 

as of december 31 2018  sunrise managed 161 of our seniors housing operating properties these properties account for a significant portion of our revenues and we rely on sunrise to manage these properties efficiently and effectively we also rely on sunrise to set appropriate resident fees to provide accurate propertylevel financial results for our properties in a timely manner and to otherwise operate them in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations any adverse developments in sunrise’s business or financial condition could impair its ability to manage our properties efficiently and effectively which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition also if sunrise experiences any significant financial legal accounting or regulatory difficulties such difficulties could result in among other things acceleration of its indebtedness impairment of its continued access to capital or the commencement of insolvency proceedings by or against it under the us bankruptcy code which in turn could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

we depend on genesis healthcare “genesis” brookdale senior living “brookdale” and promedica health system promedica for a significant portion of our revenues and any failure inability or unwillingness by them to satisfy obligations under their agreements with us could adversely affect us   

the properties we lease to genesis brookdale and promedica account for a significant portion of our revenues and because these leases are triplenet leases we also depend on genesis brookdale and promedica to pay all insurance taxes utilities and maintenance and repair expenses in connection with the leased properties we cannot assure you that genesis brookdale and promedica will have sufficient assets income and access to financing to enable them to make rental payments to us or to otherwise satisfy their respective obligations under our leases and any failure inability or unwillingness by genesis brookdale or promedica 

to do so could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition genesis brookdale and promedica have also agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses and we cannot assure you that genesis brookdale and promedica will have sufficient assets income access to financing and insurance coverage to enable them to satisfy their respective indemnification obligations genesis brookdale and promedicas failure to effectively conduct their operations or to maintain and improve our properties could adversely affect their business reputations and their ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties which in turn could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition additionally we have made real estate and other loans to genesis and their operational or other failures could adversely impact their ability to repay these loans when due 

ownership of property outside the us may subject us to different or greater risks than those associated with our domestic operations   

we have operations in canada and the uk which represent 100 and 96 of total welltower revenues respectively as of december 31 2018 revera managed 98 of our seniors housing operating properties in canada representing a significant portion of our revenues and also owned a controlling interest in sunrise international development ownership and operating activities involve risks that are different from those we face with respect to our domestic properties and operations these risks include but are not limited to any international currency gain recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates may not qualify under the 75 gross income test or the 95 gross income test that we must satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a reit challenges with respect to the repatriation of foreign earnings and cash changes in foreign political regulatory and economic conditions regionally nationally and locally including but not limited to continuing uncertainty surrounding the process of brexit and the macroeconomic and regulatory effects of brexit including impacts on the uk real estate market challenges in managing international operations challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations including those relating to real estate corporate governance operations taxes employment and other civil and criminal legal proceedings foreign ownership restrictions with respect to operations in countries differences in lending practices and the willingness of domestic or foreign lenders to provide financing regional or countryspecific business cycles and political and economic instability and failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations in the us that affect foreign operations including but not limited to the us foreign corrupt practices act if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with international expansion and operations our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected   

if our tenants do not renew their existing leases or if we are required to sell properties for liquidity reasons we may be unable to lease or sell the properties on favorable terms or at all 

we cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases at the end of their lease terms which expire at various times if these leases are not renewed we would be required to find other tenants to occupy those properties or sell them there can be no assurance that we would be able to identify suitable replacement tenants or enter into leases with new tenants on terms as favorable to us as the current leases or that we would be able to lease those properties at all 

real estate investments are relatively illiquid and most of the property we own is highly customized for specific uses our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in operator economic and other conditions will be limited no assurances can be given that we will recognize full value for any property that we are required to sell our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition we are exposed to the risks inherent in concentrating investments in real estate and in particular the seniors housing and health care industries a downturn in the real estate industry could adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to sell properties for a price or on terms acceptable to us all of the foregoing could affect our ability to continue paying dividends at the current rate   

our tenants operators and managers may not have the necessary insurance coverage to insure adequately against losses   

we maintain or require our tenants operators and managers to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties and their operations with terms conditions limits and deductibles that we believe are customary for similarlysituated companies in our industry and we frequently review our insurance programs and requirements that said we cannot assure you that we or our tenants operators or managers will continue to be able to maintain adequate levels of insurance and required coverages or that we will continue to require the same levels of insurance coverage under our lease management and other agreements which could adversely affect us in the event of a significant uninsured loss also in recent years longtermpostacute care and seniors housing operators and managers have experienced substantial increases in both the number and size of patient care liability claims as a result general and professional liability costs have increased in some markets general and professional liability insurance coverage may be restricted or very costly which may adversely affect the tenants’ operators’ and managers’ future operations cash flows and financial condition and may have a material adverse effect on the tenants’ operators’ and managers’ ability to meet their obligations to us 

our ownership of properties through ground leases exposes us to the loss of such properties upon breach or termination of the ground leases   

we have acquired an interest in certain of our properties by acquiring a leasehold interest in the property on which the building is located and we may acquire additional properties in the future through the purchase of interests in ground leases as the lessee under a ground lease we are exposed to the possibility of losing the property upon termination of the ground lease or an earlier breach of the ground lease by us 

the requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare medicaid or government funding could have a material adverse effect on our obligors’ liquidity financial condition and results of operations which could adversely affect our obligors’ ability to meet their obligations to us   

some of our obligors’ businesses are affected by government reimbursement to the extent that an operatortenant receives a significant portion of its revenues from government payors primarily medicare and medicaid such revenues may be subject to statutory and regulatory changes retroactive rate adjustments recovery of program overpayments or setoffs court decisions administrative rulings policy interpretations payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers government funding restrictions at a program level or with respect to specific facilities any lapse in congressional funding of the centers for medicare and medicaid services and interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing government investigations and audits at such property in recent years government payors have frozen or reduced payments to health care providers due to budgetary pressures health care reimbursement will likely continue to be of paramount importance to federal and state authorities we cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or effect any future legislative reforms may have on the financial condition of our obligors and properties there can be no assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will be available for services provided by any property operator whether the property receives reimbursement from medicare medicaid or private payors significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on an obligor’s liquidity financial condition and results of operations which could adversely affect the ability of an obligor to meet its obligations to us 

the health reform laws provide those states that expand their medicaid coverage to otherwise eligible state residents with incomes at or below 138 of the federal poverty level with an increased federal medical assistance percentage effective january 1 2014 when certain conditions are met given that the federal government substantially funds the medicaid expansion it is unclear how many states will ultimately pursue this option although as of early february 2018 more than 60 of the states have expanded medicaid coverage the participation by states in the medicaid expansion could have the dual effect of increasing our tenants’ revenues through new patients but further straining state budgets and their ability to pay our tenants we expect that the current presidential administration and us congress will seek to modify repeal or otherwise invalidate all or certain provisions of the health reform laws including medicaid expansion since taking office president trump has continued to support the repeal of all or portions of the health reform laws see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — united states — reimbursement” above for additional information if the operations cash flows or financial condition of our operators and tenants are materially adversely impacted by the health reform laws or future legislation our revenue and operations may be adversely affected as well more generally and because of the dynamic nature of the legislative and regulatory environment for health care products and services and in light of existing federal deficit and budgetary concerns we cannot predict the impact that broadbased farreaching legislative or regulatory changes could have on the us economy our business or that of our operators and tenants 

our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with federal state province local and industryregulated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards could adversely affect such operators’ or tenants’ operations which could adversely affect our operators’ and tenants’ ability to meet their obligations to us   

our operators and tenants generally are subject to varying levels of federal state local and industryregulated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with any of these laws regulations or standards could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension decertification or exclusion from federal and state health care programs loss of license or closure of the facility such actions may have an effect on our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make lease payments to us and therefore adversely impact us see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — united states — fraud  abuse enforcement” above 

many of our properties may require a license registration andor con to operate failure to obtain a license registration or con or loss of a required license registration or con would prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by the operators or tenants these events could materially adversely affect our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make rent or other obligatory payments to us state and local laws also may regulate the expansion including the addition of new beds or services or acquisition of medical equipment and the construction or renovation of health care facilities by requiring a con or other similar approval from a state agency see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — united states — licensing and certification” above 

the real estate market and our business may be negatively impacted by changes to us tax laws   

the tax cuts and jobs act tax act enacted in december 2017 significantly changes the us income tax rules for individuals and corporations although the tax act involves comprehensive changes to the system of corporate income tax it does not substantively change the manner in which reits are taxed although numerous provisions of the tax act do affect reits we are 

generally not subject to federal taxes applicable to regular corporations if we comply with the tax law governing reit status and distribute annually an amount at least equal to our taxable income nonetheless the tax act makes numerous changes to the individual income tax rules that may affect the real estate market in the us including limitations on the deductibility of state and local property taxes and interest although the impact of these changes is likely to be most significant in the residential real estate market rather than in the sectors where we operate the effects of these changes on the broader real estate market in the geographic areas in which we operate and on our tenants remain uncertain   

changes in applicable tax regulations could negatively affect our financial results   

we are subject to taxation in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions because even with the passage of the tax act the us maintains a worldwide corporate tax system the foreign and us tax systems are somewhat interdependent longstanding international norms that determine each country’s jurisdiction to tax crossborder international trade are evolving and could reduce the ability of our foreign subsidiaries to deduct for foreign tax purposes the interest they pay on loans from us thereby increasing the foreign tax liability of the subsidiaries it is also possible that foreign countries could increase their withholding taxes on dividends and interest given the unpredictability of these possible changes and their potential interdependency it is very difficult to assess the overall effect of such potential tax changes on our earnings and cash flow but such changes could adversely impact our financial results 

unfavorable resolution of pending and future litigation matters and disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

from time to time we may be directly involved in a number of legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims we may also be named as defendants in lawsuits allegedly arising out of our actions or the actions of our operatorstenants or managers in which such operatorstenants or managers have agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses an unfavorable resolution of pending or future litigation or legal proceedings may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition regardless of its outcome litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of management there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail in or achieve a favorable settlement of pending or future litigation in addition pending litigation or future litigation government proceedings or environmental matters could lead to increased costs or interruption of our normal business operations 

development redevelopment and construction risks could affect our profitability 

at any given time we may be in the process of constructing one or more new facilities that ultimately will require a con and license before they can be utilized by the operator for their intended use the operator also may need to obtain medicare and medicaid certification and enter into medicare and medicaid provider agreements andor third party payor contracts in the event that the operator is unable to obtain the necessary con licensure certification provider agreements or contracts after the completion of construction there is a risk that we will not be able to earn any revenues on the facility until either the initial operator obtains a license or certification to operate the new facility and the necessary provider agreements or contracts or we find and contract with a new operator that is able to obtain a license to operate the facility for its intended use and the necessary provider agreements or contracts 

in connection with our renovation redevelopment development and related construction activities we may be unable to obtain or suffer delays in obtaining necessary zoning landuse building occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations these factors could result in increased costs or our abandonment of these projects in addition we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms which may render us unable to proceed with our development activities and we may not be able to complete construction and leaseup of a property on schedule which could result in increased debt service expense or construction costs additionally the time frame required for development construction and leaseup of these properties means that we may have to wait years for significant cash returns because we are required to make cash distributions to our stockholders if the cash flow from operations or refinancing is not sufficient we may be forced to borrow additional money to fund such distributions newly developed and acquired properties may not produce the cash flow that we expect which could adversely affect our overall financial performance 

in deciding whether to acquire or develop a particular property we make assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property in particular we estimate the return on our investment based on expected occupancy rental rates and capital costs if our financial projections with respect to a new property are inaccurate as a result of increases in capital costs or other factors the property may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment our estimate of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove to be inaccurate which may result in our failure to meet our profitability goals additionally we may acquire new properties that are not fully leased and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with that property   

we may experience losses caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters which could result in an increase of our or our tenants’ cost of insurance a decrease in our anticipated revenues or a significant loss of the capital we have invested in a property   

we maintain or require our tenants to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties with terms conditions limits and deductibles that we believe are appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage and we frequently review our insurance programs and requirements however a large number of our properties are located in areas particularly susceptible to revenue loss cost increase or damage caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters such as hurricanes earthquakes tornadoes and floods we believe given current industry practice and analysis prepared by outside consultants that our and our tenants’ insurance coverage is appropriate to cover reasonably anticipated losses that may be caused by hurricanes earthquakes tornadoes floods and other severe weather conditions and natural disasters including the effects of climate change nevertheless we are always subject to the risk that such insurance will not fully cover all losses and depending on the severity of the event and the impact on our properties such insurance may not cover a significant portion of the losses these losses may lead to an increase of our and our tenants’ cost of insurance a decrease in our anticipated revenues from an affected property and a loss of all or a portion of the capital we have invested in an affected property in addition we or our tenants may not purchase insurance under certain circumstances if the cost of insurance exceeds in our or our tenants’ judgment the value of the coverage relative to the risk of loss   

we may incur costs to remediate environmental contamination at our properties which could have an adverse effect on our or our obligors’ business or financial condition 

under various laws owners or operators of real estate may be required to respond to the presence or release of hazardous substances on the property and may be held liable for property damage personal injuries or penalties that result from environmental contamination or exposure to hazardous substances we may become liable to reimburse the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination generally such liability attaches to a person based on the person’s relationship to the property our tenants or borrowers are primarily responsible for the condition of the property moreover we review environmental site assessments of the properties that we own or encumber prior to taking an interest in them those assessments are designed to meet the “all appropriate inquiry” standard which we believe qualifies us for the innocent purchaser defense if environmental liabilities arise based upon such assessments we do not believe that any of our properties are subject to material environmental contamination however environmental liabilities may be present in our properties and we may incur costs to remediate contamination which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition or the business or financial condition of our obligors   

cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our business and result in the loss of confidential information 

our business is at risk from and may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential data and other electronic security breaches including those resulting from human error product defects and technology failures such cyberattacks can range from individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems to more sophisticated security threats while we employ a number of measures to prevent detect and mitigate these threats there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a cyberattack in the past we have experienced cybersecurity breaches which to date have not had a material impact on our operations however there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our business damage our reputation cause us to incur significant remediation expense and have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations   cybersecurity breaches that compromise proprietary personal identifying or confidential information of our employees operators tenants and partners could result in legal claims or proceedings including under data privacy regulations 

our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed 

our success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel including our executive officers and other highly qualified employees and competition for their talents is intense we cannot assure you that we will retain our key personnel or that we will be able to recruit and retain other highly qualified employees in the future losing any key personnel could at least temporarily have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations   

risks arising from our capital structure   

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain antitakeover provisions 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain antitakeover provisions restrictions on share ownership and transfer and super majority stockholder approval requirements for business combinations that could make it more difficult for or even prevent a third party from acquiring us without the approval of our incumbent board of directors provisions and agreements that inhibit or discourage takeover attempts could reduce the market value of our common stock 

we may become more leveraged   

permanent financing for our investments is typically provided through a combination of public offerings of debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt the incurrence or assumption of indebtedness may cause us to become more leveraged which could 1 require us to dedicate a greater portion of our cash flow to the payment of debt service 2 make 

us more vulnerable to a downturn in the economy 3 limit our ability to obtain additional financing or 4 negatively affect our credit ratings or outlook by one or more of the rating agencies 

cash available for distributions to stockholders may be insufficient to make dividend contributions at expected levels and are made at the discretion of the board of directors   

if cash available for distribution generated by our assets decreases due to dispositions or otherwise we may be unable to make dividend distributions at expected levels our inability to make expected distributions would likely result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock all distributions are made at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with delaware law and depend on our earnings our financial condition debt and equity capital available to us our expectation of our future capital requirements and operating performance restrictive covenants in our financial and other contractual arrangements maintenance of our reit qualification restrictions under delaware law and other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time additionally our ability to make distributions will be adversely affected if any of the risks described herein or other significant adverse events occur   

we are subject to covenants in our debt agreements that could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our debt agreements contain various covenants restrictions and events of default among other things these provisions require us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness create liens and make investments or acquisitions breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness in addition to any other indebtedness crossdefaulted against such instruments these defaults could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to make future investments or to meet our obligations and commitments 

we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the capital necessary to make future investments or to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature our access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control including rising interest rates inflation and other general market conditions the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions the market price of the shares of our capital stock and the credit ratings of our debt securities the financial stability of our lenders which might impair their ability to meet their commitments to us or their willingness to make additional loans to us changes in the credit ratings on us government debt securities or default or delay in payment by the us of its obligations if our access to capital is limited by these factors or other factors it could negatively impact our ability to acquire properties repay or refinance our indebtedness fund operations or make distributions to our stockholders 

downgrades in our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital 

we plan to manage the company to maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile but there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our results of operations liquidity andor financial condition 

increases in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on our cost of capital 

an increase in interest rates may increase interest cost on new and existing variable rate debt such increases in the cost of capital could adversely impact our ability to finance operations the acquisition and development of properties and refinance existing debt additionally increased interest rates may also result in less liquid property markets limiting our ability to sell existing assets 

fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

currency exchange rate fluctuations could affect our results of operations and financial position including exchange rate fluctuations resulting from brexit we generate a portion of our revenue and expenses in such foreign currencies as the canadian dollar and the british pound sterling although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions andor obtain local currency mortgage debt in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies we cannot assure you that foreign currency fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on us 

our entry into hedge agreements may not effectively reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates   

we enter into hedge agreements from time to time to manage some of our exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate volatility these agreements involve risks such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements in addition these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates or foreign 

currency exchange rates when we use forwardstarting interest rate swaps there is a risk that we will not complete the longterm borrowing against which the swap is intended to hedge if such events occur our results of operations may be adversely affected 

risks arising from our status as a reit   

we might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a reit   

we intend to operate as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” and believe we have and will continue to operate in such a manner if we lose our status as a reit we will face serious income tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for satisfying our obligations and for distribution to our stockholders because 

 since reit qualification requires us to meet a number of complex requirements it is possible that we may fail to fulfill them and if we do our earnings will be reduced by the amount of us federal and other income taxes owed a reduction in our earnings would affect the amount we could distribute to our stockholders if we do not qualify as a reit we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders since a nonreit is not required to pay dividends to stockholders in order to maintain reit status or avoid an excise tax in addition if we fail to qualify as a reit all distributions to stockholders would continue to be treated as dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits although corporate stockholders may be eligible for the dividends received deduction and individual stockholders may be eligible for taxation at the rates generally applicable to longterm capital gains currently at a maximum rate of 20 with respect to distributions 

as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to implement our business strategy and would adversely affect the value of our common stock qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to remain qualified as a reit although we believe that we qualify as a reit we cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as a reit for us federal income tax purposes 

certain subsidiaries might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

we own interests in a number of entities which have elected to be taxed as reits for us federal income tax purposes some of which we consolidate for financial reporting purposes but each of which is treated as a separate reit for federal income tax purposes each a “subsidiary reit” to qualify as a reit each subsidiary reit must independently satisfy all of the reit qualification requirements under the code together with all other rules applicable to reits provided that each subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit our interests in the subsidiary reits will be treated as qualifying real estate assets for purposes of the reit asset tests if a subsidiary reit fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year such subsidiary reit will be subject to federal and state income taxes and may not be able to qualify as a reit for the four subsequent taxable years any such failure could have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reit income and asset tests and thus our ability to qualify as a reit unless we are able to avail ourselves of certain relief provisions   

the 90 annual distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions   

to comply with the 90 distribution requirement applicable to reits and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax we must make distributions to our stockholders although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the reit distribution requirement it is possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90 distribution requirement or we may decide to retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation this may be due to timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses on the one hand and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income on the other hand in addition nondeductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of noncash deductions may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90 distribution requirement in the event that timing differences occur or we deem it appropriate to retain cash we may borrow funds issue additional equity securities although we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so pay taxable stock dividends if possible distribute other property or securities or engage in other transactions intended to enable us to meet the reit distribution requirements this may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations   

the lease of qualified health care properties to a taxable reit subsidiary is subject to special requirements 

we lease certain qualified health care properties to taxable reit subsidiaries or limited liability companies of which the taxable reit subsidiaries are members which lessees contract with managers or related parties to manage the health care operations at these properties the rents from this taxable reit subsidiary lessee structure are treated as qualifying rents from real property if 1 they are paid pursuant to an armslength lease of a qualified health care property with a taxable reit subsidiary and 2 the manager qualifies as an eligible independent contractor as defined in the code if any of these conditions are not satisfied then the rents will not be qualifying rents 

if certain saleleaseback transactions are not characterized by the internal revenue service “irs” as “true leases” we may be subject to adverse tax consequences   

we have purchased certain properties and leased them back to the sellers of such properties and we may enter into similar transactions in the future we intend for any such saleleaseback transaction to be structured in such a manner that the lease will be characterized as a “true lease” thereby allowing us to be treated as the owner of the property for us federal income tax purposes however depending on the terms of any specific transaction the irs might take the position that the transaction is not a “true lease” but is more properly treated in some other manner in the event any saleleaseback transaction is challenged and successfully recharacterized by the irs we would not be entitled to claim the deductions for depreciation and cost recovery generally available to an owner of property furthermore if a saleleaseback transaction were so recharacterized we might fail to satisfy the reit asset tests or income tests and consequently could lose our reit status effective with the year of recharacterization alternatively the amount of our reit taxable income could be recalculated which may cause us to fail to meet the reit annual distribution requirements for a taxable year 

we could be subject to changes in our tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities   

we are subject to taxes in the us and foreign jurisdictions our analysis of the tax act may be impacted by any corrective legislation and any guidance provided by the us treasury and the irs our effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation we are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the irs and other tax authorities and governmental bodies we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations if we were subject to review or examination by the irs or applicable foreign jurisdiction as the result of any new tax law changes including the recently enacted tax act the ultimate determination of which may change our taxes owed for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued or recorded our financial condition operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected

 item 3 legal proceedings 

from time to time there are various legal proceedings pending against us that arise in the ordinary course of our business management does not believe that the resolution of any of these legal proceedings either individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition further from time to time we are party to certain legal proceedings for which third parties such as tenants operators andor managers are contractually obligated to indemnify defend and hold us harmless in some of these matters the indemnitors have insurance for the potential damages in other matters we are being defended by tenants and other obligated third parties and these indemnitors may not have sufficient insurance assets income or resources to satisfy their defense and indemnification obligations to us the unfavorable resolution of such legal proceedings could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect the indemnitors’ ability to satisfy their respective obligations to us which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition it is management’s opinion that there are currently no such legal proceedings pending that will individually or in the aggregate have such a material adverse effect despite management’s view of the ultimate resolution of these legal proceedings we may have significant legal expenses and costs associated with the defense of such matters further management cannot predict the outcome of these legal proceedings and if management’s expectation regarding such matters is not correct such proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various market risks including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we seek to mitigate the underlying foreign currency exposures with gains and losses on derivative contracts hedging these exposures we seek to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates by matching the terms of new investments with new longterm fixed rate borrowings to the extent possible we may or may not elect to use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate exposure these decisions are principally based on our policy to match our variable rate investments with comparable borrowings but are also based on the general trend in interest rates at the applicable dates and our perception of the future volatility of interest rates this section is presented to provide a discussion of the risks associated with potential fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates for more information see notes 11 and 16 to our consolidated financial statements 

we historically borrow on our primary unsecured credit facility to acquire construct or make loans relating to health care and seniors housing properties then as market conditions dictate we will issue equity or longterm fixed rate debt to repay the borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility and new commercial paper program we are subject to risks associated with debt financing including the risk that existing indebtedness may not be refinanced or that the terms of refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of current indebtedness the majority of our borrowings were completed under indentures or contractual agreements that limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur accordingly in the event that we are unable to raise additional equity or borrow money because of these limitations our ability to acquire additional properties may be limited 

a change in interest rates will not affect the interest expense associated with our fixed rate debt interest rate changes however will affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt changes in the interest rate environment upon maturity of this fixed rate debt could have an effect on our future cash flows and earnings depending on whether the debt is replaced with other fixed rate debt variable rate debt or equity or repaid by the sale of assets to illustrate the impact of changes in the interest rate markets we performed a sensitivity analysis on our fixed rate debt instruments whereby we modeled the change in net present values arising from a hypothetical 1 increase in interest rates to determine the instruments’ change in fair value the following table summarizes the analysis performed as of the dates indicated in thousands   



  

our variable rate debt including our primary unsecured credit facility is reflected at fair value at december 31 2018  we had  2683553000 outstanding related to our variable rate debt assuming no changes in outstanding balances a 1 increase in interest rates would result in increased annual interest expense of  26836000  at december 31 2017  we had  2294678000 outstanding under our variable rate debt assuming no changes in outstanding balances a 1 increase in interest rates would have resulted in increased annual interest expense of  22947000  

we are subject to currency fluctuations that may from time to time affect our financial condition and results of operations increases or decreases in the value of the canadian dollar or british pounds sterling relative to the us dollar impact the amount of net income we earn from our investments in canada and the united kingdom based solely on our results for the year ended december 31 2018  including the impact of existing hedging arrangements if these exchange rates were to increase or decrease by 10 our net income from these investments would increase or decrease as applicable by less than  10000000  we will continue to mitigate these underlying foreign currency exposures with nonus denominated borrowings and gains and losses on derivative contracts if we increase our international presence through investments in or acquisitions or development of seniors housing and health care properties outside the us we may also decide to transact additional business or borrow funds in currencies other than us dollars canadian dollars or british pounds sterling to illustrate the impact of changes in foreign currency markets we performed a sensitivity analysis on our derivative portfolio whereby we modeled the change in net present values arising from a hypothetical 1 increase in foreign currency exchange rates to determine the instruments’ change in fair value the following table summarizes the results of the analysis performed excluding cross currency hedge activity dollars in thousands

outpatient medical buildings  the outpatient medical building portfolio consists of health care related buildings that generally include physician offices ambulatory surgery centers diagnostic facilities outpatient services andor labs our portfolio has a strong affiliation with health systems approximately 95 of our outpatient medical building portfolio is affiliated with health systems with buildings on hospital campuses or serving as satellite locations for the health system and its physicians we typically lease our outpatient medical buildings to multiple tenants and provide varying levels of property management our outpatient medical segment accounted for 13 of total revenues for each of the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 no single tenant exceeds 20 of segment revenues 

  

investments 

  

we invest in seniors housing and health care real estate primarily through acquisitions developments and joint venture partnerships for additional information regarding acquisition and development activity please see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements we seek to diversify our investment portfolio by property type relationship and geographic location in determining whether to invest in a property we focus on the following 1 the experience of the obligor’spartner’s management 

  

team 2 the historical and projected financial and operational performance of the property 3 the credit of the obligorpartner 4 the security for any lease or loan 5 the real estate attributes of the building and its location 6 the capital committed to the property by the obligorpartner and 7 the operating fundamentals of the applicable industry 

  

we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property our asset management process for seniors housing properties generally includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each property review of obligorpartner creditworthiness property inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure real estate taxes letters of credit and other collateral our internal property management division manages and monitors the outpatient medical portfolio with a comprehensive process including review of among other things tenant relations lease expirations the mix of health service providers hospitalhealth system relationships property performance capital improvement needs and market conditions 

  

investment types 

  

real property our properties are primarily comprised of land buildings improvements and related rights our triplenet properties are generally leased to operators under longterm operating leases the leases generally have a fixed contractual term of 12 to 15 years and contain one or more five to 15year renewal options certain of our leases also contain purchase options a portion of which could result in the disposition of properties for less than full market value most of our rents are received under triplenet leases requiring the operator to pay rent and all additional charges incurred in the operation of the leased property the tenants are required to repair rebuild and maintain the leased properties substantially all of these operating leases are designed with escalating rent structures leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straightline basis over the initial lease period subject to a collectability assessment rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period 

  

at december 31 2017 approximately 92 of our triplenet properties were subject to master leases a master lease is a lease of multiple properties to one tenant entity under a single lease agreement from time to time we may acquire additional properties that are then leased to the tenant under the master lease the tenant is required to make one monthly payment that represents rent on all the properties that are subject to the master lease typically the master lease tenant can exercise its right to purchase the properties or to renew the master lease only with respect to all leased properties at the same time this bundling feature benefits us because the tenant cannot limit the purchase or renewal to the better performing properties and terminate the leasing arrangement with respect to the poorer performing properties this spreads our risk among the entire group of properties within the master lease the bundling feature should provide a similar advantage to us if the master lease tenant is in bankruptcy subject to certain restrictions a debtor in bankruptcy has the right to assume or reject its unexpired leases and executory contracts in the context of integrated master leases such as ours our tenants in bankruptcy would be required to assume or reject the master lease as a whole rather than deciding on a property by property basis 

  

our outpatient medical portfolio is primarily selfmanaged and consists principally of multitenant properties leased to health care providers our leases typically include increasers and some form of operating expense reimbursement by the tenant as of december 31 2017 80 of our portfolio included leases with full pass through 19 with a partial expense reimbursement modified gross and 1 with no expense reimbursement gross our outpatient medical leases are noncancellable operating leases that have a weightedaverage remaining term of seven years at december 31 2017 and are often credit enhanced by security deposits guaranties andor letters of credit   

  

construction we provide for the construction of properties for tenants primarily as part of longterm operating leases we capitalize certain interest costs associated with funds used for the construction of properties owned by us the amount capitalized is based upon the amount advanced during the construction period using the rate of interest that approximates our companywide cost of financing our interest expense is reduced by the amount capitalized we also typically charge a transaction fee at the commencement of construction which we defer and amortize to income over the term of the resulting lease the construction period commences upon funding and terminates upon the earlier of the completion of the applicable property or the end of a specified period during the construction period we advance funds to the tenants in accordance with agreed upon terms and conditions which require among other things periodic site visits by a company representative during the construction period we generally require an additional credit enhancement in the form of payment and performance bonds andor completion guaranties at december 31 2017 we had outstanding construction investments of 237746000 and were committed to provide additional funds of approximately 429815000 to complete construction for investment properties see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information we also provide for construction loans which depending on the terms and conditions could be treated as loans real property or investments in unconsolidated entities 

  

real estate loans our real estate loans are typically structured to provide us with interest income principal amortization and transaction fees and are generally secured by firstsecond mortgage liens leasehold mortgages corporate guaranties andor personal guaranties at december 31 2017 we had gross outstanding real estate loans of 495871000 the interest yield averaged approximately 92 per annum on our outstanding real estate loan balances our yield on real estate loans depends upon a number of factors including the stated interest rate average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments the real estate loans outstanding at december 31 2017 are generally subject to one to 15year terms with principal amortization schedules andor balloon payments of the outstanding principal balances at the end of the term typically real estate loans are crossdefaulted and crosscollateralized with other real estate loans operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its affiliates see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

  

  

  investments in unconsolidated entities  investments in entities that we do not consolidate but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are reported under the equity method of accounting our investments in unconsolidated entities generally represent interests ranging from 10 to 50 in real estate assets under the equity method of accounting our share of the investee’s earnings or losses is included in our consolidated results of operations to the extent that our cost basis is different from the basis reflected at the entity level the basis difference is generally amortized over the lives of the related assets and liabilities and such amortization is included in our share of equity in earnings of the entity the initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated entities is based on the amount paid to purchase the entity interest or the estimated fair value of the assets prior to the sale of interests in the entity we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the equity method investment to its carrying value when we determine a decline in the estimated fair value of such an investment below its carrying value is otherthantemporary an impairment is recorded see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for more information 

  

principles of consolidation 

  the consolidated financial statements are in conformity with us general accepted accounting principles “us gaap” and include the accounts of our whollyowned subsidiaries and joint venture entities that we control through voting rights or other means all material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation 

  at inception of joint venture transactions we identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights “variable interest entities” or “vies” and determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of its operations a vie is broadly defined as an entity where either i the equity investors as a group if any do not have a controlling financial interest or ii the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support we consolidate investments in vies when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary accounting standards codification topic 810 consolidations requires enterprises to perform a qualitative approach to determining whether or not a vie will need to be consolidated this evaluation is based on an enterprise’s ability to direct and influence the activities of a vie that most significantly impact that entity’s economic performance 

  for investments in joint ventures us gaap may preclude consolidation by the sole general partner in certain circumstances based on the type of rights held by the limited partners we assess the limited partners’ rights and their impact on our consolidation conclusions and we reassess if there is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights of the limited partners the sole general partner increases or decreases its ownership of limited partnership interests or there is an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding limited partnership interests we similarly evaluate the rights of managing members of limited liability companies 

  

  

borrowing policies 

  

we utilize a combination of debt and equity to fund investments our debt and equity levels are determined by management to maintain a conservative balance sheet and credit profile generally we intend to issue unsecured fixedrate public debt with longterm maturities to approximate the maturities on our triplenet leases and investment strategy for shortterm purposes we may borrow on our primary unsecured credit facility we replace these borrowings with longterm capital such as senior unsecured notes or common stock when terms are deemed favorable we may invest in properties subject to existing mortgage indebtedness in addition we may obtain secured financing for unleveraged properties in which we have invested or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis in certain agreements with our lenders we are subject to restrictions with respect to secured and unsecured indebtedness 

  

competition 

  

we compete with other real estate investment trusts real estate partnerships private equity and hedge fund investors banks insurance companies financeinvestment companies governmentsponsored agencies taxable and taxexempt bond funds health care operators developers and other investors in the acquisition development leasing and financing of health care and seniors housing properties we compete for investments based on a number of factors including relationships certainty of execution investment structures and underwriting criteria our ability to successfully compete is impacted by economic and demographic trends availability of acceptable investment opportunities our ability to negotiate beneficial investment terms availability and cost of capital construction and renovation costs and applicable laws and regulations 

  

the operatorstenants of our properties compete with properties that provide comparable services in the local markets operatorstenants compete for patients and residents based on a number of factors including quality of care reputation physical appearance of properties location services offered family preferences physicians staff and price we also face competition from other health care facilities for tenants such as physicians and other health care providers that provide comparable facilities and services

health care industry 

  

the demand for health care services and consequently health care properties is projected to reach unprecedented levels in the near future the centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” projects that national health expenditures will rise to approximately 37 trillion in 2018 or 185 of gross domestic product the average annual growth in national health expenditures for 2015 through 2025 is expected to be 58 while demographics are the primary driver of demand economic conditions and availability of services contribute to health care service utilization rates we believe the health care property market may be less susceptible to fluctuations and economic downturns relative to other property sectors investor interest in the market remains strong especially in specific sectors such as privatepay seniors housing and outpatient medical buildings the total us population for 2015 through 2025 is projected to increase by 93 the elderly population aged 65 and over is projected to increase by 36 through 2025 the elderly are an important component of health care utilization especially independent living services assisted living services longtermpostacute care services inpatient and outpatient hospital services and physician ambulatory care most health care services are provided within a health care facility such as a hospital a physician’s office or a seniors housing community therefore we believe there will be continued demand for companies such as ours with expertise in health care real estate 

  

health care real estate investment opportunities tend to increase as demand for health care services increases we recognize the need for health care real estate as it correlates to health care service demand health care providers require real estate to house their businesses and expand their services we believe that investment opportunities in health care real estate will continue to be present due to 

·   the specialized nature of the industry which enhances the credibility and experience of the company 

·   the projected population growth combined with stable or increasing health care utilization rates which ensures demand and 

·   the ongoing merger and acquisition activity 

  

certain government regulations 

  

united states 

  

health law matters — generally 

  

  typically operators of seniors housing facilities do not receive significant funding from government programs and are largely subject to state laws as opposed to federal laws operators of longtermpostacute care facilities and hospitals do receive significant funding from government programs and these facilities are subject to extensive regulation including federal and state laws covering the type and quality of medical andor nursing care provided ancillary services  eg  respiratory occupational physical and infusion therapies qualifications of the administrative personnel and nursing staff the adequacy of the physical plant and equipment reimbursement and rate setting and operating policies in addition as described below operators of these facilities are subject to extensive laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including but not limited to the federal antikickback statute “aks” the federal stark law “stark law” and the federal false claims act “fca” as well as comparable state laws hospitals physician group practice clinics and other health care providers that operate in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal state and local licensure registration certification and inspection laws regulations and industry standards our tenants’ failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in among other things loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension decertification or exclusion from federal and state health care programs loss of license or closure of the facility see risk factors “the requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid could have a material adverse effect on our obligors’ liquidity financial condition and results of operations which could adversely affect our obligors’ ability to meet their obligations to us” and “our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with federal state local and industryregulated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards could adversely affect such operators’ or tenants’ operations which could adversely affect our operators’ and tenants’ ability to meet their obligations to us” in “item 1a – risk factors” below 

  

licensing and certification 

  

  the primary regulations that affect longterm and postacute care facilities are state licensing and registration laws for example certain health care facilities are subject to a variety of licensure and certificate of need “con” laws and regulations where applicable con laws generally require among other requirements that a facility demonstrate the need for 1 constructing a new facility 2 adding beds or expanding an existing facility 3 investing in major capital equipment or adding new services 4 changing the ownership or control of an existing licensed facility or 5 terminating services that have been previously approved through the con process certain state con laws and regulations may restrict the ability of operators to add new properties or 

  

expand an existing facility’s size or services in addition con laws may constrain the ability of an operator to transfer responsibility for operating a particular facility to a new operator 

  

  with respect to licensure generally our longtermpostacute care facilities are required to be licensed and certified for participation in medicare medicaid and other federal and state health care programs the failure of our operators to maintain or renew any required license or regulatory approval as well as the failure of our operators to correct serious deficiencies identified in a compliance survey could require those operators to discontinue operations at a property in addition if a property is found to be out of compliance with medicare medicaid or other federal or state health care program conditions of participation the property operator may be excluded from participating in those government health care programs 

  

reimbursement 

  

  the reimbursement methodologies applied to health care facilities continue to evolve federal and state authorities have considered and may seek to implement new or modified reimbursement methodologies including valuebased reimbursement methodologies that may negatively impact health care property operations the impact of any such changes if implemented may result in a material adverse effect on our portfolio no assurance can be given that current revenue sources or levels will be maintained accordingly there can be no assurance that payments under a government health care program are currently or will be in the future sufficient to fully reimburse the property operators for their operating and capital expenses 

·   seniors housing facilities approximately 60 of our overall revenues for the year ended december 31 2017 were attributable to us seniors housing facilities the majority of the revenues received by the operators of these facilities are from private pay sources the remaining revenue source is primarily medicaid provided under state waiver programs for home and community based care as of september 30 2017 14 of our 43 seniors housing operators received medicaid reimbursement pursuant to medicaid waiver programs for the twelve months ended september 30 2017 approximately 12 of the revenues at our seniors housing facilities were from medicaid reimbursement there can be no guarantee that a state medicaid program operating pursuant to a waiver will be able to maintain its waiver status rates paid by selfpay residents are set by the facilities and are determined by local market conditions and operating costs generally facilities receive a higher payment per day for a private pay resident than for a medicaid beneficiary who requires a comparable level of care the level of medicaid reimbursement varies from state to state thus the revenues generated by operators of our assisted living facilities may be adversely affected by payor mix acuity level changes in medicaid eligibility and reimbursement levels in addition a state could lose its medicaid waiver and no longer be permitted to utilize medicaid dollars to reimburse for assisted living services 

·   longtermpostacute care facilities  approximately 8 of our overall revenues for the year ended december 31 2017 were attributable to us longtermpostacute care facilities the majority of the revenues received by the operators of these facilities are from the medicare and medicaid programs with the balance representing reimbursement payments from private payors consequently changes in federal or state reimbursement policies may adversely affect an operator’s ability to cover its expenses including our rent or debt service longtermpostacute care facilities are subject to periodic pre and postpayment reviews and other audits by federal and state authorities a review or audit of a property operator’s claims could result in recoupments denials or delay of payments in the future due to the significant judgments and estimates inherent in payor settlement accounting no assurance can be given as to the adequacy of any reserves maintained by our property operators to cover potential adjustments to reimbursements or to cover settlements made to payors recent focus on billing practices payments and quality of care or ongoing government pressure to reduce spending by government health care programs could result in lower payments to longtermpostacute care facilities and as a result may impair an operator’s ability to meet its financial obligations to us 

☐   medicare reimbursement   for the twelve months ended september 30 2017 approximately 35 of the revenues at our longtermpostacute care facilities were paid by medicare generally longtermpostacute care facilities are reimbursed under the medicare skilled nursing facility prospective payment system “snf pps” the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system “irf pps” or the longterm care hospital prospective payment system “ltch pps” which generally provide reimbursement based upon a predetermined fixed amount per episode of care and are updated by cms an agency of the department of health and human services “hhs” annually in august 2017 cms made some positive payment updates for fiscal year “fy” 2017 under the snf pps the irf pps and the ltch pps in particular cms published a final rule regarding fy 2018 medicare payment policies and rates for 

§   snf pps under the final snf pps rule cms projects that payments to snfs will increase in fy 2018 on an aggregate basis by 10 from payments in fy 2017 

§   irf pps under the irf pps rule cms estimates that aggregate payments to irfs will increase in fy 2018 on an aggregate basis by 09 relative to payments in fy 2017 

§   ltch pps as a result of the continuation of the phasein of site neutral payment rates for specified cases in ltchs cms projects fy 2018 medicare payments to ltchs will decrease by 24 payment rates will increase by 10 for cases that qualify for the higher standard ltch pps rate cms also finalized its proposal to remove from fy 2018 payment rates the temporary 06 medicare part a hospital payment increase to fy 2017 payment rates implemented in connection with a federal district court’s review of the “two midnight” payment policy 

there is a risk under these payment systems that costs will exceed the fixed payments or that payments may be set below the costs to provide certain items and services in addition the hhs office of inspector general has released recommendations to address snf billing practices and medicare payment rates if followed these recommendations regarding snf payment reform may impact our tenants and operators 

  

☐   medicaid reimbursement  for the twelve months ended september 30 2017 approximately 36 of the revenues of our longtermpostacute care facilities were paid by medicaid many states reimburse snfs for example using fixed daily rates which are applied prospectively based on patient acuity and the historical costs incurred in providing patient care in most states medicaid does not fully reimburse the cost of providing services certain states are attempting to slow the rate of medicaid growth by freezing rates or restricting eligibility and benefits in addition medicaid reimbursement rates may decline if state revenues in a particular state are not sufficient to fund budgeted expenditures 

·   medicare reimbursement for physicians hospital outpatient departments “hopds” and ambulatory surgical centers “ascs”   changes in reimbursement to physicians hopds and ascs may further affect our tenants and operators generally medicare reimburses physicians under the physician fee schedule while hopds and ascs are reimbursed under prospective payment systems the physician fee schedule and the hopd and asc prospective payment systems are updated annually by cms these annual medicare payment regulations have resulted in lower net pay increases than providers of those services have often expected in addition the medicare and children’s health insurance program reauthorization act of 2015 “macra” includes payment reductions for providers who do not meet government quality standards the implementation of payforquality models like those required under macra is expected to produce funding disparities that could adversely impact some provider tenants in outpatient medical buildings and other health care properties changes in medicare advantage plan payments may also indirectly affect our operators and tenants that contract with medicare advantage plans  

·   health reform laws the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the “health reform laws” dramatically altered how health care is delivered and reimbursed in the us and contained various provisions including medicaid expansion and the establishment of health insurance exchanges “hies” providing subsidized health insurance that may directly impact us or the operators and tenants of our properties since taking office president trump and the current us congress have sought to modify repeal or otherwise invalidate all or portions of the health reform laws for example in october 2017 president trump issued an executive order in which he stated that it is his administration’s policy to seek the prompt repeal of the health reform laws and directed executive departments and federal agencies to waive defer grant exemptions from or delay the implementation of the provisions of the health reform laws to the maximum extent permitted by law  on the same day the federal government separately announced that costsharing reduction payments to insurers offering qualified health plans through the hies would end effective immediately unless congress appropriated the funds further in december 2017 the us congress passed the tax cuts and jobs act which included a provision that eliminates the penalty under the health reform laws’ individual mandate and could impact the future state of the hies established by the health reform laws there is still uncertainty with respect to the additional impact president trump’s administration and the us congress may have if any and any changes will likely take time to unfold and could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for health care items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the health reform laws we cannot predict whether the existing health reform laws or future health care reform legislation or regulatory changes will have a material impact on our operators’ or tenants’ property or business 

  

  fraud  abuse enforcement 

  

  longtermpostacute care facilities and seniors housing facilities that receive medicaid payments are subject to federal state and local laws regulations and applicable guidance that govern the operations and financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by health care providers certain of these laws such as the aks and stark law prohibit direct or indirect payments of any kind for the purpose of inducing or encouraging the referral of patients for medical products or services reimbursable by government health care programs other laws require providers to furnish only medically necessary services and submit to the government valid and accurate statements for each service specifically our operators and tenants that receive payments from federal healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid are subject to substantial financial penalties under the civil monetary penalties act and the fca and in particular actions under the fca’s “whistleblower” provisions private enforcement of health care fraud has increased due in large part to amendments to the fca that encourage private individuals to sue on behalf of the government in addition states may also have separate false claims acts which among other things generally prohibit health care providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payments still other laws require providers to comply with a variety of safety health and other requirements relating to the condition of the licensed property and the quality of care provided sanctions for violations of these laws regulations and other applicable guidance may include but are not limited to criminal andor civil penalties and fines loss of licensure immediate termination of government payments exclusion from any government health care program damage assessments and imprisonment in certain circumstances violation of these rules such as those prohibiting abusive and fraudulent behavior with respect to one property may subject other facilities under common control or ownership to sanctions including exclusion from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs as well as other government health care programs in the ordinary course of its business a property operator is regularly subjected to inquiries investigations and audits by the federal and state agencies that oversee these laws and regulations 

  

  prosecutions investigations or whistleblower actions could have a material adverse effect on a property operator’s liquidity financial condition and operations which could adversely affect the ability of the operator to meet its financial obligations to us in addition government investigations and enforcement actions brought against the health care industry have increased dramatically over the past several years and are expected to continue although the responsibility for enforcing these laws and regulations lies with a variety of federal state and local governmental agencies some may be enforced by private litigants through federal and state false claims acts and other laws including some state privacy laws that allow for private individuals to bring actions the costs for an 

  

operator of a health care property associated with both defending such enforcement actions and the undertakings in settling these actions can be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its obligations to us 

  

federal and state data privacy and security laws 

  

  the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” as amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act and numerous other state and federal laws govern the collection security dissemination use access to and confidentiality of individually identifiable health information violations of these laws may result in substantial civil andor criminal fines and penalties the costs for an operator of a health care property associated with developing and maintaining hipaa compliance systems defending enforcement actions and paying any assessed fines can be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its obligations to us 

  

united kingdom 

  

  in the uk care home services are principally regulated by the health and social care act 2008 as amended and other regulations this legislation subjects service providers to a number of legally binding “fundamental standards” and requires amongst other things that all persons carrying out “regulated activities” in the uk and the managers of such persons be registered providers of care home services are also subject as data controllers to laws governing their use of personal data including in relation to their employees clients and recipients of their services these laws currently take the form of the uk’s data protection act 1998 enforced by the uk’s information commissioner’s office but are expected to be replaced by the european union’s “eu” new general data protection regulation “gdpr” the gdpr will impose a significant number of new obligations with the potential for fines of up to 4 of annual worldwide turnover or €20 million whichever is greater entities incorporated in or carrying on a business in the uk as well as individuals residing in the uk are also subject to the uk bribery act 2010 the uk recently introduced a new national minimum wage with a maximum fine for nonpayment of £20000 per worker and employers who fail to pay will be banned from being a company director for up to 15 years the uk recently voted to exit from the eu “brexit” negotiations on the exit agreement are underway but at present it is not possible to predict whether brexit will have a material impact on our operators’ or tenants’ property or business

  alberta 

  

  in alberta there are three relevant designations for seniors’ living arrangements ordered below from the most independent to the highest level of care 

·   retirement homes also called independent living are designed for older adults able to live on their own and may offer various lifestyle amenities these residences may be rented privately owned or lifeleased and may be operated for profit or nonprofit support services are not usually offered but can be arranged by residents retirement homes do not generally receive government funding residents pay for tenancy and services received rental subsidies may be available to qualified seniors independent living residences are subject to provincial tenancy and housing laws

·   nursing homes also called longterm care are for residents who have complex unpredictable medical needs and who require 24hour onsite registered nurse assessment or treatment nursing homes are regulated by provincial laws and governed by the ministry of health operators are not licensed but enter into agreements with the ministry for the operation of nursing homes and must comply with certain accommodation standards homes can be operated by private forprofit or 

  

notforprofit or public operators operators that receive public funds for health and personal care services must also comply with certain health service standards and legislation aimed at protecting residents alberta health regulates the maximum accommodation fee in publiclyfunded nursing homes health services in longterm care are publiclyfunded provided through alberta health services private sector operators are eligible to apply for government funding and the minister may make grants to an operator in respect of its operating or capital costs 

  

ontario 

  

  retirement homes are regulated and licensed under a provincial law aimed at protecting residents retirement homes do not receive government funding residents enter into tenancy agreements under provincial tenancy law and pay for tenancy and services received residents may access publiclyfunded external care services at the home from external suppliers retirement home licenses are granted by the retirement homes regulatory authority “rhra” and are nontransferable the rhra administers the law governing retirement homes to ensure that licensees are meeting certain standards generally with respect to care and safety the law requires any person to report to the rhra when there are reasonable grounds to suspect abuse of a resident by anyone or neglect of a resident by staff the rhra conducts a mandatory inspection and issues a report that is posted on the rhra’s public website and also must be posted in the subject home if it is the most recent report the registrar of the rhra can receive complaints about a retirement home contravening a provision of the law and if such a complaint is received it must be reviewed promptly the registrar has broad powers relating to complaint investigation and action the rhra registrar has the power to inspect a retirement home at any time without warning or issue a warrant to ensure compliance compliance inspections occur at least every three years the registrar has the power to make a variety of orders including the imposition of a fine or an order revoking the operator’s license the applicable law also enumerates offenses such as operating without a license and provides for penalties for offenses 

  

  british columbia 

  

  provincial laws regulate and license “community care facilities” longterm care homes in substantially the same manner as retirement homes are regulated under ontario laws community care facilities are defined as premises used for the purpose of supervising vulnerable persons who require three or more prescribed services from a list that includes regular assistance with activities of daily living distribution of medication management of cash resources monitoring of food intake structured behavior management and intervention and psychosocial or physical rehabilitative therapy 

  

  provincial law also recognizes and regulates “assisted living residences” for seniors who can live independently but require assistance with certain activities services available can include meals housekeeping monitoring and emergency support socialrecreational opportunities and transportation assisted living residences do not require a license but must be registered with the registrar of assisted living residences and must be operated in a manner that does not jeopardize the health or safety of residents if the registrar believes the standard is not being met the registrar may inspect the residence and may suspend or cancel a registration independent living residences offer housing and hospitality services for retired adults who are functionally independent and able to direct their own care 

  

québec 

  

  provincial laws in québec regulate retirement homes private seniors’ residences as well as longterm care homes residential and longterm care centers private seniors’ residences are required to obtain a certificate of compliance based on prescribed operating standards a certificate of compliance is issued for a period of four years and is renewable the regional health and social agency may revoke or refuse to issue or renew a certificate of compliance if among other things the operator fails to comply with the applicable law the agency may also order corrective measures further to an inspection complaint or investigation the agency is authorized to inspect a residence at any reasonable time of day in order to ascertain whether it complies with the law 

  

  private seniors’ residences may belong to either or both of the following categories i those offering services to independent elderly persons and ii those offering services to semiindependent elderly persons the operator must for each category comply with the applicable criteria and standards with some exceptions for residences with fewer than six or ten rooms or apartments there are requirements with respect to residents’ health and safety meal services and recreation content of residents’ files disclosure of information to residents and staffing among other things 

  

  in may 2017 quebec adopted the act to combat maltreatment of seniors and other persons of full age in vulnerable situations  which aims to implement a quebecwide framework agreement to combat maltreatment targets all facilities that provide health services and social services to seniors and vulnerable persons including health establishments and private residences we expect that it will affect private seniors’ residences in the following ways 

·   health establishments are required to adopt an “antimaltreatment policy” providing notably for the measures put in place to prevent maltreatment of persons in vulnerable situations 

·   the policy adopted by health establishments will notably have to include the required adaptation for the implementation of the policy in private sector residences and 

  

·   operators of private seniors’ residences will be required to apply the policy adopted by the integrated health and social services center in their territory as well as ensure that the policy is known by residents their family members and their employees 

  

  other related laws 

  

  privacy 

  

  the services provided in our facilities are subject to privacy legislation in canada including in certain provinces privacy laws specifically related to personal health information although the obligations of custodians of personal information in the various provinces differ they all include the obligation to protect the information the organizations with which we have management agreements may be the custodian of personal information collected in connection with the operation of our facilities 

  

  privacy laws in canada are consentbased and require the implementation of a privacy program involving policies procedures and the designation of an individual or team with primary responsibility for privacy law compliance mandatory breach notification to affected individuals is a requirement under some laws mandatory breach notification to the applicable regulator is a requirement in some provinces some laws require notification where personal information is processed or stored outside of canada one provincial law in quebec provides for fines where an organization fails to perform due diligence before outsourcing activities involving personal information to a service provider outside of the province 

  

  the powers of privacy regulators and penalties for violations of privacy law vary according to the applicable law or are left to the courts to date monetary penalties granted have been on the low side although that is changing with civil actions for breach of privacy and may change further as a result of class action activity there are over 60 privacy class actions which have been filed in canada over recent years although none have yet been decided on their merits regulators have the authority to make public the identity of a custodian that has been found to have committed a breach so there is a reputational risk associated with privacy law violations even where no monetary damages are incurred the notification of residents mandatory under some privacy laws and other activities required to manage a privacy breach can give rise to significant costs 

  

  other legislation 

  

  retirement homes may be subject to residential tenancy laws such that there can be restrictions on rent increases and termination of tenancies for instance other provincial andor municipal laws applicable to fire safety food services zoning occupational health and safety public health and the provision of community health care and funded longtermpostacute care may also apply to retirement homes 

  

taxation 

  

  us federal income tax considerations 

  

  general 

  

  we elected to be taxed as a reit commencing with our first taxable year we intend to continue to operate in such a manner as to qualify as a reit but there is no guarantee that we will qualify or remain qualified as a reit for subsequent years qualification and taxation as a reit depends upon our ability to meet a variety of complex qualification tests imposed under federal income tax law with respect to income assets distribution level and diversity of share ownership there can be no assurance that we will be owned and organized and will operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified 

  

  failure to qualify as a reit 

  

  if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates distributions to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify as a reit will not be deductible nor will any particular amount of distributions be required to be made in any year all distributions to stockholders will be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these distributions and subject to certain limitations will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporate stockholders unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions we also will be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to statutory relief failure to qualify for even one year could result in our need to incur indebtedness or liquidate investments in order to pay potentially significant resulting tax liabilities 

  

  the tax cuts and jobs act “tax act” 

  

  

  the tax act made significant changes to the us federal income tax laws applicable to businesses and their owners including reits and their shareholders congressional leaders have recognized that the process of adopting extensive tax legislation in a short amount of time without hearings and substantial time for review may have led to drafting errors issues needing clarification and unintended consequences that may need to be addressed subsequent tax legislation it is unknown when congress may address these issues or when the internal revenue service “irs” may issue guidance regarding the interpretation and implementation of the tax act we cannot predict what impact future legislation and guidance will have on us or our shareholders

 item 1a risk factors 

  

  this section discusses the most significant factors that affect our business operations and financial condition it does not describe all risks and uncertainties applicable to us our industry or ownership of our securities if any of the following risks as well as other risks and uncertainties that are not addressed in this section or that we have not yet identified actually occur we could be materially adversely affected and the value of our securities could decline we group these risk factors into three categories 

•   risks arising from our business 

•   risks arising from our capital structure and 

•   risks arising from our status as a reit 

  

risks arising from our business 

  

our investments in and acquisitions of health care and seniors housing properties may be unsuccessful or fail to meet our expectations 

  

  we are exposed to the risk that some of our acquisitions may not prove to be successful we could encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired properties including contingent liabilities and acquired properties might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business if we agree to provide construction funding to an operatortenant and the project is not completed we may need to take steps to ensure completion of the project such expenditures may negatively affect our results of operations investments in and acquisitions of seniors housing and health care properties entail risks associated with real estate investments generally including risks that the investment will not achieve expected returns that the cost estimates for necessary property improvements will prove inaccurate or that the tenant operator or manager will fail to meet performance expectations furthermore there can be no assurance that our anticipated acquisitions and investments the completion of which is subject to various conditions will be consummated in accordance with anticipated timing on anticipated terms or at all health care properties are often highly customizable and the development or redevelopment of such properties may require costly tenantspecific improvements we also may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties into our existing operations and this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition as a result we cannot assure you that we will achieve the economic benefit we expect from acquisitions investment development and redevelopment opportunities all of the foregoing could affect our ability to continue paying dividends at the current rate 

  

our investments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by our lack of exclusive control over these investments our partners’ insolvency or failure to meet their obligations and disputes between us and our partners 

  

  we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into partnerships or joint ventures with other persons or entities joint venture investments involve risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership including the possibility that our partner might become insolvent refuse to make capital contributions when due or otherwise fail to meet its obligations which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments that our partner might at any time have economic or other business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our interests or goals that we could become engaged in a dispute with our partner which could require us to expend additional resources to resolve such dispute and could have an adverse impact on the operations and profitability of the joint venture and that our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests in addition our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted in some instances we andor our partner may have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partner’s interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction our ability to acquire our partner’s interest may be limited if we do not have sufficient cash available borrowing capacity or other capital resources in such event we may be forced to sell our interest in the joint venture when we would otherwise prefer to retain it joint ventures may require us to share decisionmaking authority with our partners which could limit our ability to control the properties in the joint ventures even when we have a controlling interest certain major decisions may require partner approval such as the sale acquisition or financing of a property 

  

we are exposed to operational risks with respect to our seniors housing operating properties that could adversely affect our revenue and operations 

  

  we are exposed to various operational risks with respect to our seniors housing operating properties that may increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to generate revenues these risks include fluctuations in occupancy medicare and medicaid reimbursement if applicable and private pay rates economic conditions competition federal state local and industryregulated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards the availability and increases in cost of general and professional liability insurance coverage state regulation and rights of residents related to entrance fees and the availability and 

  

increases in the cost of labor as a result of unionization or otherwise any one or a combination of these factors may adversely affect our revenue and operations 

  

decreases in our operators’ revenues or increases in our operators’ expenses could affect our operators’ ability to make payments to us 

  

  our operators’ revenues are primarily driven by occupancy private pay rates and medicare and medicaid reimbursement if applicable expenses for these facilities are primarily driven by the costs of labor food utilities taxes insurance and rent or debt service revenues from government reimbursement have and may continue to come under pressure due to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls operating costs continue to increase for our operators to the extent that any decrease in revenues andor any increase in operating expenses result in a property not generating enough cash to make payments to us the credit of our operator and the value of other collateral would have to be relied upon to the extent the value of such property is reduced we may need to record an impairment for such asset furthermore if we determine to dispose of an underperforming property such sale may result in a loss any such impairment or loss on sale would negatively affect our financial results all of the foregoing could affect our ability to continue paying dividends at the current rate 

  

increased competition and oversupply may affect our operators’ ability to meet their obligations to us 

  

  the operators of our properties compete on a local and regional basis with operators of properties and other health care providers that provide comparable services for residents and patients including on the basis of the scope and quality of care and services provided reputation and financial condition physical appearance of the properties price and location our operators are expected to encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to attract residents or expand their businesses in addition we expect that there will continue to be a more than adequate inventory of seniors housing facilities we cannot be certain that the operators of all of our facilities will be able to achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us if our operators cannot compete effectively or if there is an oversupply of facilities their financial performance and ability to meet their obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

  

a severe cold and flu season epidemics or any other widespread illnesses could adversely affect the occupancy of our seniors housing operating and triplenet properties 

  

  our and our operators’ revenues are dependent on occupancy it is impossible to predict the severity of the cold and flu season or the occurrence of epidemics or any other widespread illnesses the occupancy of our seniors housing operating and triplenet properties could significantly decrease in the event of a severe cold and flu season an epidemic or any other widespread illness such a decrease could affect the operating income of our seniors housing operating properties and the ability of our triplenet operators to make payments to us in addition a flu pandemic could significantly increase the cost burdens faced by our operators including if they are required to implement quarantines for residents and adversely affect their ability to meet their obligations to us which would have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

  

the insolvency or bankruptcy of our tenants operators borrowers managers and other obligors may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

  we are exposed to the risk that our tenants operators borrowers managers or other obligors may not be able to meet the rent principal and interest or other payments due us which may result in a tenant operator borrower manager or other obligor bankruptcy or insolvency or that a tenant operator borrower manager or other obligor might become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings for other reasons although our operating lease agreements provide us with the right to evict a tenant demand immediate payment of rent and exercise other remedies and our loans provide us with the right to terminate any funding obligation demand immediate repayment of principal and unpaid interest foreclose on the collateral and exercise other remedies the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization a tenant operator borrower manager or other obligor in bankruptcy or subject to insolvency proceedings may be able to limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent in the case of a lease or to receive unpaid principal and interest in the case of a loan and to exercise other rights and remedies in addition if a lease is rejected in a tenant bankruptcy our claim against the tenant may be limited by applicable provisions of the bankruptcy law we may be required to fund certain expenses eg real estate taxes and maintenance to preserve the value of an investment property avoid the imposition of liens on a property andor transition a property to a new tenant in some instances we have terminated our lease with a tenant and relet the property to another tenant in some of those situations we have provided working capital loans to and limited indemnification of the new obligor if we cannot transition a leased property to a new tenant we may take possession of that property which may expose us to certain successor liabilities should such events occur our revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely affected all of the foregoing could affect our ability to continue paying dividends at the current rate 

  

we may not be able to timely reinvest our sale proceeds on terms acceptable to us 

  

  from time to time we will have cash available from the proceeds of sales of our securities principal payments on our loans receivable or the sale of properties including nonelective dispositions under the terms of master leases or similar financial support 

  

arrangements in order to maintain current revenues and continue generating attractive returns we expect to reinvest these proceeds in a timely manner we compete for real estate investments with a broad variety of potential investors including other health care reits real estate partnerships health care providers health care lenders and other investors including developers banks insurance companies pension funds governmentsponsored entities and private equity firms some of whom may have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do this competition for attractive investments may negatively affect our ability to make timely investments on terms acceptable to us 

  

we depend on genesis healthcare “genesis” and brookdale senior living “brookdale” for a significant portion of our revenues and any failure inability or unwillingness by them to satisfy obligations under their agreements with us could adversely affect us 

  

  the properties we lease to genesis and brookdale account for a significant portion of our revenues and because our leases with genesis and brookdale are triplenet leases we also depend on genesis and brookdale to pay all insurance taxes utilities and maintenance and repair expenses in connection with the leased properties we cannot assure you that genesis and brookdale will have sufficient assets income and access to financing to enable them to make rental payments to us or to otherwise satisfy their respective obligations under our leases and any failure inability or unwillingness by genesis or brookdale to do so could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition although the most recent publicly available financial statements of genesis reflect going concern disclosures the operator remains current on rent and the coverage remains above 10 genesis and brookdale have also agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses and we cannot assure you that genesis and brookdale will have sufficient assets income access to financing and insurance coverage to enable them to satisfy their respective indemnification obligations genesis’s and brookdale’s failure to effectively conduct their operations or to maintain and improve our properties could adversely affect their business reputations and their ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties which in turn could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition additionally we have made real estate and other loans to genesis and their operational or other failures could adversely impact their ability to repay these loans when due see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding genesis 

  

the properties managed by sunrise senior living llc “sunrise” account for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income and any adverse developments in its business or financial condition could adversely affect us 

  

  as of december 31 2017 sunrise managed 158 of our seniors housing operating properties these properties account for a significant portion of our revenues and we rely on sunrise to manage these properties efficiently and effectively we also rely on sunrise to set appropriate resident fees to provide accurate propertylevel financial results for our properties in a timely manner and to otherwise operate them in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations any adverse developments in sunrise’s business or financial condition could impair its ability to manage our properties efficiently and effectively which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition also if sunrise experiences any significant financial legal accounting or regulatory difficulties such difficulties could result in among other things acceleration of its indebtedness impairment of its continued access to capital or the commencement of insolvency proceedings by or against it under the us bankruptcy code which in turn could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

  

ownership of property outside the us may subject us to different or greater risks than those associated with our domestic operations 

  

  we have operations in canada and the uk international development ownership and operating activities involve risks that are different from those we face with respect to our domestic properties and operations these risks include but are not limited to any international currency gain recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates may not qualify under the 75 gross income test or the 95 gross income test that we must satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a reit challenges with respect to the repatriation of foreign earnings and cash changes in foreign political regulatory and economic conditions regionally nationally and locally including but not limited to the uk’s june 2016 vote to exit the eu challenges in managing international operations challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations including those relating to real estate corporate governance operations taxes employment and other civil and criminal legal proceedings foreign ownership restrictions with respect to operations in countries differences in lending practices and the willingness of domestic or foreign lenders to provide financing regional or countryspecific business cycles and political and economic instability and failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations in the us that affect foreign operations including but not limited to the us foreign corrupt practices act if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with international expansion and operations our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

  

if our tenants do not renew their existing leases or if we are required to sell properties for liquidity reasons we may be unable to lease or sell the properties on favorable terms or at all 

  

  

  we cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases at the end of their lease terms which expire at various times if these leases are not renewed we would be required to find other tenants to occupy those properties or sell them there can be no assurance that we would be able to identify suitable replacement tenants or enter into leases with new tenants on terms as favorable to us as the current leases or that we would be able to lease those properties at all 

  

  real estate investments are relatively illiquid and most of the property we own is highly customized for specific uses our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in operator economic and other conditions will be limited no assurances can be given that we will recognize full value for any property that we are required to sell our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition we are exposed to the risks inherent in concentrating investments in real estate and in particular the seniors housing and health care industries a downturn in the real estate industry could adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to sell properties for a price or on terms acceptable to us all of the foregoing could affect our ability to continue paying dividends at the current rate 

  

our tenants operators and managers may not have the necessary insurance coverage to insure adequately against losses 

  

  we maintain or require our tenants operators and managers to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties and their operations with terms conditions limits and deductibles that we believe are customary for similarlysituated companies in our industry and we frequently review our insurance programs and requirements that said we cannot assure you that we or our tenants operators or managers will continue to be able to maintain adequate levels of insurance and required coverages or that we will continue to require the same levels of insurance coverage under our lease management and other agreements which could adversely affect us in the event of a significant uninsured loss also in recent years longtermpostacute care and seniors housing operators and managers have experienced substantial increases in both the number and size of patient care liability claims as a result general and professional liability costs have increased in some markets general and professional liability insurance coverage may be restricted or very costly which may adversely affect the tenants’ operators’ and managers’ future operations cash flows and financial condition and may have a material adverse effect on the tenants’ operators’ and managers’ ability to meet their obligations to us 

  

our ownership of properties through ground leases exposes us to the loss of such properties upon breach or termination of the ground leases 

  

  we have acquired an interest in certain of our properties by acquiring a leasehold interest in the property on which the building is located and we may acquire additional properties in the future through the purchase of interests in ground leases as the lessee under a ground lease we are exposed to the possibility of losing the property upon termination of the ground lease or an earlier breach of the ground lease by us 

  

the requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare medicaid or government funding could have a material adverse effect on our obligors’ liquidity financial condition and results of operations which could adversely affect our obligors’ ability to meet their obligations to us 

  

  some of our obligors’ businesses are affected by government reimbursement to the extent that an operatortenant receives a significant portion of its revenues from government payors primarily medicare and medicaid such revenues may be subject to statutory and regulatory changes retroactive rate adjustments recovery of program overpayments or setoffs court decisions administrative rulings policy interpretations payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers government funding restrictions at a program level or with respect to specific facilities and interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing government investigations and audits at such property in recent years government payors have frozen or reduced payments to health care providers due to budgetary pressures health care reimbursement will likely continue to be of paramount importance to federal and state authorities we cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or effect any future legislative reforms may have on the financial condition of our obligors and properties there can be no assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will be available for services provided by any property operator whether the property receives reimbursement from medicare medicaid or private payors significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on an obligor’s liquidity financial condition and results of operations which could adversely affect the ability of an obligor to meet its obligations to us 

  

  the health reform laws provide those states that expand their medicaid coverage to otherwise eligible state residents with incomes at or below 138 of the federal poverty level with an increased federal medical assistance percentage effective january 1 2014 when certain conditions are met given that the federal government substantially funds the medicaid expansion it is unclear how many states will ultimately pursue this option although as of early february 2018 more than 60 of the states have expanded medicaid coverage the participation by states in the medicaid expansion could have the dual effect of increasing our tenants’ revenues through new patients but further straining state budgets and their ability to pay our tenants we expect that the current presidential administration and us congress will seek to modify repeal or otherwise invalidate all or certain provisions of the health reform laws including medicaid expansion since taking office president trump has continued to support the repeal of all or portions of the health reform laws see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — united states — reimbursement” above for additional information if the operations cash flows or financial condition of our operators and tenants are 

  

materially adversely impacted by the health reform laws or future legislation our revenue and operations may be adversely affected as well more generally and because of the dynamic nature of the legislative and regulatory environment for health care products and services and in light of existing federal deficit and budgetary concerns we cannot predict the impact that broadbased farreaching legislative or regulatory changes could have on the us economy our business or that of our operators and tenants 

  

our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with federal state province local and industryregulated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards could adversely affect such operators’ or tenants’ operations which could adversely affect our operators’ and tenants’ ability to meet their obligations to us 

  

  our operators and tenants generally are subject to varying levels of federal state local and industryregulated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with any of these laws regulations or standards could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension decertification or exclusion from federal and state health care programs loss of license or closure of the facility such actions may have an effect on our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make lease payments to us and therefore adversely impact us see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — united states — fraud  abuse enforcement” above 

  

  many of our properties may require a license registration andor con to operate failure to obtain a license registration or con or loss of a required license registration or con would prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by the operators or tenants these events could materially adversely affect our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make rent or other obligatory payments to us state and local laws also may regulate the expansion including the addition of new beds or services or acquisition of medical equipment and the construction or renovation of health care facilities by requiring a con or other similar approval from a state agency see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — united states — licensing and certification” above 

  

the real estate market and our business may be negatively impacted by changes to us tax laws 

  

  the tax act adopted on december 22 2017 significantly changes the us income tax rules for individuals and corporations we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the tax act and as such its implications for our business remain uncertain although the tax act involves comprehensive changes to the system of corporate income tax it does not substantively change the manner in which reits are taxed although numerous provisions of the tax act do affect reits we are generally not subject to pay federal taxes applicable to regular corporations if we comply with the tax regulations governing reit status nonetheless the tax act makes numerous changes to the individual income tax rules that may affect the real estate market in the us including limitations on the deductibility of state and local property taxes the elimination of the deductibility of interest on new home equity loans and a reduction in the limit for an individual’s mortgage interest expense to interest on 750000 of mortgages although the impact of these changes is likely to be most significant in the residential real estate market rather than in the sectors where we operate the effects of these changes on the broader real estate market in the geographic areas in which we operate and on our tenants remain uncertain 

  

changes in applicable tax regulations could negatively affect our financial results 

  

  we are subject to taxation in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions because even with the passage of the tax act the us maintains a worldwide corporate tax system the foreign and us tax systems are somewhat interdependent longstanding international norms that determine each country’s jurisdiction to tax crossborder international trade are evolving such as the base erosion and profit shifting project “beps” currently being undertaken by the g8 g20 and organization for economic cooperation and development tax changes pursuant to beps could reduce the ability of our foreign subsidiaries to deduct for foreign tax purposes the interest they pay on loans from us thereby increasing the foreign tax liability of the subsidiaries it is also possible that foreign countries could increase their withholding taxes on dividends and interest given the unpredictability of these possible changes and their potential interdependency it is very difficult to assess the overall effect of such potential tax changes on our earnings and cash flow but such changes could adversely impact our financial results 

  

unfavorable resolution of pending and future litigation matters and disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

  

  from time to time we may be directly involved in a number of legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims we may also be named as defendants in lawsuits allegedly arising out of our actions or the actions of our operatorstenants or managers in which such operatorstenants or managers have agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses an unfavorable resolution of pending or future litigation or legal proceedings may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition regardless of its outcome litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of management there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail in or achieve a favorable settlement of pending or future litigation in addition pending litigation or future litigation government proceedings or environmental matters could lead to increased costs or interruption of our normal business operations 

  

development redevelopment and construction risks could affect our profitability 

  

  

  at any given time we may be in the process of constructing one or more new facilities that ultimately will require a con and license before they can be utilized by the operator for their intended use the operator also may need to obtain medicare and medicaid certification and enter into medicare and medicaid provider agreements andor third party payor contracts in the event that the operator is unable to obtain the necessary con licensure certification provider agreements or contracts after the completion of construction there is a risk that we will not be able to earn any revenues on the facility until either the initial operator obtains a license or certification to operate the new facility and the necessary provider agreements or contracts or we find and contract with a new operator that is able to obtain a license to operate the facility for its intended use and the necessary provider agreements or contracts 

  

  in connection with our renovation redevelopment development and related construction activities we may be unable to obtain or suffer delays in obtaining necessary zoning landuse building occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations these factors could result in increased costs or our abandonment of these projects in addition we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms which may render us unable to proceed with our development activities and we may not be able to complete construction and leaseup of a property on schedule which could result in increased debt service expense or construction costs additionally the time frame required for development construction and leaseup of these properties means that we may have to wait years for significant cash returns because we are required to make cash distributions to our stockholders if the cash flow from operations or refinancing is not sufficient we may be forced to borrow additional money to fund such distributions newly developed and acquired properties may not produce the cash flow that we expect which could adversely affect our overall financial performance 

  

  in deciding whether to acquire or develop a particular property we make assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property in particular we estimate the return on our investment based on expected occupancy rental rates and capital costs if our financial projections with respect to a new property are inaccurate as a result of increases in capital costs or other factors the property may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment our estimate of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove to be inaccurate which may result in our failure to meet our profitability goals additionally we may acquire new properties that are not fully leased and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with that property 

  

we may experience losses caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters which could result in an increase of our or our tenants’ cost of insurance a decrease in our anticipated revenues or a significant loss of the capital we have invested in a property 

  

  we maintain or require our tenants to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties with terms conditions limits and deductibles that we believe are appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage and we frequently review our insurance programs and requirements however a large number of our properties are located in areas particularly susceptible to revenue loss cost increase or damage caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters such as hurricanes earthquakes tornadoes and floods we believe given current industry practice and analysis prepared by outside consultants that our and our tenants’ insurance coverage is appropriate to cover reasonably anticipated losses that may be caused by hurricanes earthquakes tornadoes floods and other severe weather conditions and natural disasters including the effects of climate change nevertheless we are always subject to the risk that such insurance will not fully cover all losses and depending on the severity of the event and the impact on our properties such insurance may not cover a significant portion of the losses these losses may lead to an increase of our and our tenants’ cost of insurance a decrease in our anticipated revenues from an affected property and a loss of all or a portion of the capital we have invested in an affected property in addition we or our tenants may not purchase insurance under certain circumstances if the cost of insurance exceeds in our or our tenants’ judgment the value of the coverage relative to the risk of loss 

  

we may incur costs to remediate environmental contamination at our properties which could have an adverse effect on our or our obligors’ business or financial condition 

  

  under various laws owners or operators of real estate may be required to respond to the presence or release of hazardous substances on the property and may be held liable for property damage personal injuries or penalties that result from environmental contamination or exposure to hazardous substances we may become liable to reimburse the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination generally such liability attaches to a person based on the person’s relationship to the property our tenants or borrowers are primarily responsible for the condition of the property moreover we review environmental site assessments of the properties that we own or encumber prior to taking an interest in them those assessments are designed to meet the “all appropriate inquiry” standard which we believe qualifies us for the innocent purchaser defense if environmental liabilities arise based upon such assessments we do not believe that any of our properties are subject to material environmental contamination however environmental liabilities may be present in our properties and we may incur costs to remediate contamination which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition or the business or financial condition of our obligors 

  

cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our business and result in the loss of confidential information 

  

  our business is at risk from and may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential data and other electronic security breaches including those resulting from human error product defects and technology failures such cyberattacks can range from individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems to 

  

more sophisticated security threats while we employ a number of measures to prevent detect and mitigate these threats there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a cyberattack cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our business compromise the confidential information of our employees operators tenants and partners damage our reputation and have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed 

  

  our success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel including our executive officers and other highly qualified employees and competition for their talents is intense we cannot assure you that we will retain our key personnel or that we will be able to recruit and retain other highly qualified employees in the future losing any key personnel could at least temporarily have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

  

risks arising from our capital structure 

  

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain antitakeover provisions 

  

  our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain antitakeover provisions restrictions on share ownership and transfer and super majority stockholder approval requirements for business combinations that could make it more difficult for or even prevent a third party from acquiring us without the approval of our incumbent board of directors provisions and agreements that inhibit or discourage takeover attempts could reduce the market value of our common stock 

  

we may become more leveraged 

  

  permanent financing for our investments is typically provided through a combination of public offerings of debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt the incurrence or assumption of indebtedness may cause us to become more leveraged which could 1 require us to dedicate a greater portion of our cash flow to the payment of debt service 2 make us more vulnerable to a downturn in the economy 3 limit our ability to obtain additional financing or 4 negatively affect our credit ratings or outlook by one or more of the rating agencies 

  

cash available for distributions to stockholders may be insufficient to make dividend contributions at expected levels and are made at the discretion of the board of directors 

  

  if cash available for distribution generated by our assets decreases due to dispositions or otherwise we may be unable to make dividend distributions at expected levels our inability to make expected distributions would likely result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock all distributions are made at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with delaware law and depend on our earnings our financial condition debt and equity capital available to us our expectation of our future capital requirements and operating performance restrictive covenants in our financial and other contractual arrangements maintenance of our reit qualification restrictions under delaware law and other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time additionally our ability to make distributions will be adversely affected if any of the risks described herein or other significant adverse events occur 

  

we are subject to covenants in our debt agreements that could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

  our debt agreements contain various covenants restrictions and events of default among other things these provisions require us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness create liens and make investments or acquisitions breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness in addition to any other indebtedness crossdefaulted against such instruments these defaults could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to make future investments or to meet our obligations and commitments 

  

  we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the capital necessary to make future investments or to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature our access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control including rising interest rates inflation and other general market conditions the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions the market price of the shares of our capital stock and the credit ratings of our debt securities the financial stability of our lenders which might impair their ability to meet their commitments to us or their willingness to make additional loans to us changes in the credit ratings on us government debt securities or default or delay in payment by the us of its obligations if our access to capital is limited by these factors or other factors it could negatively impact our ability to acquire properties repay or refinance our indebtedness fund operations or make distributions to our stockholders 

  

  

downgrades in our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital 

  

  we plan to manage the company to maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile but there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our results of operations liquidity andor financial condition 

  

increases in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on our cost of capital 

  

  an increase in interest rates may increase interest cost on new and existing variable rate debt such increases in the cost of capital could adversely impact our ability to finance operations the acquisition and development of properties and refinance existing debt additionally increased interest rates may also result in less liquid property markets limiting our ability to sell existing assets 

  

fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

  

  currency exchange rate fluctuations could affect our results of operations and financial position we generate a portion of our revenue and expenses in such foreign currencies as the canadian dollar and the british pound sterling although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions andor obtain local currency mortgage debt in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies we cannot assure you that foreign currency fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on us 

  

our entry into hedge agreements may not effectively reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates 

  

  we enter into hedge agreements from time to time to manage some of our exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate volatility these agreements involve risks such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements in addition these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates when we use forwardstarting interest rate swaps there is a risk that we will not complete the longterm borrowing against which the swap is intended to hedge if such events occur our results of operations may be adversely affected 

  

risks arising from our status as a reit 

  

we might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

  

  we intend to operate as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” and believe we have and will continue to operate in such a manner if we lose our status as a reit we will face serious income tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for satisfying our obligations and for distribution to our stockholders because 

•   we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rates 

•   we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes and 

•   unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions we could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified 

  

  since reit qualification requires us to meet a number of complex requirements it is possible that we may fail to fulfill them and if we do our earnings will be reduced by the amount of us federal and other income taxes owed a reduction in our earnings would affect the amount we could distribute to our stockholders if we do not qualify as a reit we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders since a nonreit is not required to pay dividends to stockholders in order to maintain reit status or avoid an excise tax in addition if we fail to qualify as a reit all distributions to stockholders would continue to be treated as dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits although corporate stockholders may be eligible for the dividends received deduction and individual stockholders may be eligible for taxation at the rates generally applicable to longterm capital gains currently at a maximum rate of 20 with respect to distributions 

  

  as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to implement our business strategy and would adversely affect the value of our common stock qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to remain qualified as a reit although we believe that we qualify as a reit we cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify or remain qualified as a reit for us federal income tax purposes 

  

certain subsidiaries might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

  

  

  we own interests in a number of entities which have elected to be taxed as reits for us federal income tax purposes some of which we consolidate for financial reporting purposes but each of which is treated as a separate reit for federal income tax purposes each a “subsidiary reit” to qualify as a reit each subsidiary reit must independently satisfy all of the reit qualification requirements under the code together with all other rules applicable to reits provided that each subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit our interests in the subsidiary reits will be treated as qualifying real estate assets for purposes of the reit asset tests if a subsidiary reit fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year such subsidiary reit will be subject to federal and state income taxes and may not be able to qualify as a reit for the four subsequent taxable years any such failure could have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reit income and asset tests and thus our ability to qualify as a reit unless we are able to avail ourselves of certain relief provisions 

  

the 90 annual distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions 

  

  to comply with the 90 distribution requirement applicable to reits and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax we must make distributions to our stockholders although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the reit distribution requirement it is possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90 distribution requirement or we may decide to retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation this may be due to timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses on the one hand and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income on the other hand in addition nondeductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of noncash deductions may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90 distribution requirement in the event that timing differences occur or we deem it appropriate to retain cash we may borrow funds issue additional equity securities although we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so pay taxable stock dividends if possible distribute other property or securities or engage in another transaction intended to enable us to meet the reit distribution requirements this may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations 

  

the lease of qualified health care properties to a taxable reit subsidiary is subject to special requirements 

  

  we lease certain qualified health care properties to taxable reit subsidiaries or limited liability companies of which the taxable reit subsidiaries are members which lessees contract with managers or related parties to manage the health care operations at these properties the rents from this taxable reit subsidiary lessee structure are treated as qualifying rents from real property if 1 they are paid pursuant to an armslength lease of a qualified health care property with a taxable reit subsidiary and 2 the manager qualifies as an eligible independent contractor as defined in the code if any of these conditions are not satisfied then the rents will not be qualifying rents 

  

if certain saleleaseback transactions are not characterized by the internal revenue service “irs” as “true leases” we may be subject to adverse tax consequences 

  

  we have purchased certain properties and leased them back to the sellers of such properties and we may enter into similar transactions in the future we intend for any such saleleaseback transaction to be structured in such a manner that the lease will be characterized as a “true lease” thereby allowing us to be treated as the owner of the property for us federal income tax purposes however depending on the terms of any specific transaction the irs might take the position that the transaction is not a “true lease” but is more properly treated in some other manner in the event any saleleaseback transaction is challenged and successfully recharacterized by the irs we would not be entitled to claim the deductions for depreciation and cost recovery generally available to an owner of property furthermore if a saleleaseback transaction were so recharacterized we might fail to satisfy the reit asset tests or income tests and consequently could lose our reit status effective with the year of recharacterization alternatively the amount of our reit taxable income could be recalculated which may cause us to fail to meet the reit annual distribution requirements for a taxable year 

  

we could be subject to changes in our tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

  

  we are subject to taxes in the us and foreign jurisdictions our analysis of the tax act may be impacted by any corrective legislation and any guidance provided by the us treasury the irs or by the general explanation of the tax act which is under preparation by the staff of the congressional joint committee on taxation our effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation we are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the irs and other tax authorities and governmental bodies we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations if we were subject to review or examination by the irs or applicable foreign jurisdiction as the result of any new tax law changes including the recently enacted tax act the ultimate determination of which may change our taxes owed for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued or recorded our financial condition operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

  from time to time there are various legal proceedings pending against us that arise in the ordinary course of our business management does not believe that the resolution of any of these legal proceedings either individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition further from time to time we are party to certain legal proceedings for which third parties such as tenants operators andor managers are contractually obligated to indemnify defend and hold us harmless in some of these matters the indemnitors have insurance for the potential damages in other matters we are being defended by tenants and other obligated third parties and these indemnitors may not have sufficient insurance assets income or resources to satisfy their defense and indemnification obligations to us the unfavorable resolution of such legal proceedings could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect the indemnitors’ ability to satisfy their respective obligations to us which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition it is management’s opinion that there are currently no such legal proceedings pending that will individually or in the aggregate have such a material adverse effect despite management’s view of the ultimate resolution of these legal proceedings we may have significant legal expenses and costs associated with the defense of such matters further management cannot predict the outcome of these legal proceedings and if management’s expectation regarding such matters is not correct such proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   we are exposed to various market risks including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we seek to mitigate the underlying foreign currency exposures with gains and losses on derivative contracts hedging these exposures we seek to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates by matching the terms of new investments with new longterm fixed rate borrowings to the extent possible we may or may not elect to use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate exposure these decisions are principally based on our policy to match our variable rate investments with comparable borrowings but are also based on the general trend in interest rates at the applicable dates and our perception of the future volatility of interest rates this section is a discussion of the risks associated with potential fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates for more information see notes 11 and 16 to our consolidated financial statements 

  we historically borrow on our primary unsecured credit facility to acquire construct or make loans relating to health care and seniors housing properties then as market conditions dictate we will issue equity or longterm fixed rate debt to repay the borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility we are subject to risks associated with debt financing including the risk that existing indebtedness may not be refinanced or that the terms of refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of current indebtedness the majority of our borrowings were completed under indentures or contractual agreements that limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur accordingly in the event that we are unable to raise additional equity or borrow money because of these limitations our ability to acquire additional properties may be limited 

  a change in interest rates will not affect the interest expense associated with our fixed rate debt interest rate changes however will affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt changes in the interest rate environment upon maturity of this fixed rate debt could have an effect on our future cash flows and earnings depending on whether the debt is replaced with other fixed rate debt variable rate debt or equity or repaid by the sale of assets to illustrate the impact of changes in the interest rate markets we performed a sensitivity analysis on our fixed rate debt instruments whereby we modeled the change in net present values arising from a hypothetical 1 increase in interest rates to determine the instruments’ change in fair value the following table summarizes the analysis performed as of the dates indicated in thousands 

  



  

  our variable rate debt including our primary unsecured credit facility is reflected at fair value at december 31 2017 we had 2294678000 outstanding related to our variable rate debt assuming no changes in outstanding balances a 1 increase in interest rates would result in increased annual interest expense of 22947000 at december 31 2016 we had 2311996000 outstanding under our variable rate debt assuming no changes in outstanding balances a 1 increase in interest rates would have resulted in increased annual interest expense of 23120000 

  we are subject to currency fluctuations that may from time to time affect our financial condition and results of operations increases or decreases in the value of the canadian dollar or british pounds sterling relative to the us dollar impact the amount of net income we earn from our investments in canada and the united kingdom based solely on our results for the year ended december 31 2017 including the impact of existing hedging arrangements if these exchange rates were to increase or decrease by 10 our net income from these investments would increase or decrease as applicable by less than 12000000 we will continue to mitigate these underlying foreign currency exposures with nonus denominated borrowings and gains and losses on derivative contracts if we increase our international presence through investments in or acquisitions or development of seniors housing and health care properties outside the us we may also decide to transact additional business or borrow funds in currencies other than us dollars canadian dollars or british pounds sterling to illustrate the impact of changes in foreign currency markets we performed a sensitivity analysis on our derivative portfolio whereby we modeled the change in net present values arising from a hypothetical 1 increase in foreign currency exchange rates to determine the instruments’ change in fair value the following table summarizes the results of the analysis performed excluding cross currency hedge activity dollars in thousands

seniors housing operating 

  

our seniors housing operating properties include several of the facility types described in “item 1 – business – property types – triplenet” including independent living facilities and independent supportive living facilities assisted living facilities care homes and alzheimer’sdementia care facilities properties are primarily held in consolidated joint venture entities with operating partners we utilize the structure proposed in the reit investment diversification and empowerment act of 2007 which is commonly referred to as a “ridea” structure the provisions of the internal revenue code authorizing the ridea structure were enacted as part of the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for more information

outpatient medical 

  

our outpatient medical properties include outpatient medical buildings and prior to june 30 2015 life science facilities we typically lease our outpatient medical buildings to multiple tenants and provide varying levels of property management our life science investment represented an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture entity our outpatient medical segment accounted for 13 13 and 12 of total revenues for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively no single tenant exceeds 20 of segment revenues 

  

 

  

outpatient medical buildings  the outpatient medical building portfolio consists of health care related buildings that generally include physician offices ambulatory surgery centers diagnostic facilities outpatient services andor labs our portfolio has a strong affiliation with health systems approximately 95 of our outpatient medical building portfolio is affiliated with health systems with buildings on hospital campuses or serving as satellite locations for the health system and its physicians 

  

life science facilities  the life science portfolio consisted of laboratory and office facilities specifically designed and constructed for use by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies these facilities were located adjacent to the massachusetts institute of technology which is a wellestablished market known for pharmaceutical and biotechnology research they are similar to commercial office buildings with advanced hvac heating ventilation and air conditioning electrical and mechanical systems on june 30 2015 we disposed of our life science investments 

  

investments 

  

depending upon market conditions we believe that new investments will be available in the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to our stockholders we invest in seniors housing and health care real estate primarily through acquisitions developments and joint venture partnerships for additional information regarding acquisition and development activity please see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements we diversify our investment portfolio by property type relationship and geographic location in determining whether to invest in a property we focus on the following 1 the experience of the obligor’spartner’s management team 2 the historical and projected financial and operational performance of the property 3 the credit of the obligorpartner 4 the security for any lease or loan 5 the real estate attributes of the building and its location 6 the capital committed to the property by the obligorpartner and 7 the operating fundamentals of the applicable industry we conduct market research and analysis for all potential investments in addition we review the value of all properties the interest rates and covenant requirements of any facilitylevel debt to be assumed at the time of the acquisition and the anticipated sources of repayment of any existing debt that is not to be assumed at the time of the acquisition 

  

we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property our proactive and comprehensive asset management process for seniors housing properties generally includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each property review of obligorpartner creditworthiness property inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure real estate taxes letters of credit and other collateral our internal property management division actively manages and monitors the outpatient medical portfolio with a comprehensive process including review of among other things tenant relations lease expirations the mix of health service providers hospitalhealth system relationships property performance capital improvement needs and market conditions in monitoring our portfolio our personnel use a proprietary database to collect and analyze propertyspecific data additionally we conduct extensive research to ascertain industry trends 

  

we evaluate the operating environment in each property’s market to determine the likely trend in operating performance of the facility when we identify unacceptable trends we seek to mitigate eliminate or transfer the risk through these efforts we are generally able to intervene at an early stage to address any negative trends and in so doing support both the collectability of revenue and the value of our investment 

  

investment types 

  

real property our properties are primarily comprised of land buildings improvements and related rights our triplenet properties are generally leased to operators under longterm operating leases the leases generally have a fixed contractual term of 12 to 15 years and contain one or more five to 15year renewal options certain of our leases also contain purchase options a portion of which could result in the disposition of properties for less than full market value most of our rents are received under triplenet leases requiring the operator to pay rent and all additional charges incurred in the operation of the leased property the tenants are required to repair rebuild and maintain the leased properties substantially all of these operating leases are designed with escalating rent structures leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straightline basis over the initial lease period subject to a collectability assessment rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period 

  

at december 31 2016 approximately 92 of our triplenet properties were subject to master leases a master lease is a lease of multiple properties to one tenant entity under a single lease agreement from time to time we may acquire additional properties that are then leased to the tenant under the master lease the tenant is required to make one monthly payment that represents rent on all the properties that are subject to the master lease typically the master lease tenant can exercise its right to purchase the properties or to renew the master lease only with respect to all leased properties at the same time this bundling feature benefits us because the tenant cannot limit the purchase or renewal to the better performing properties and terminate the leasing arrangement with respect to the poorer performing properties this spreads our risk among the entire group of properties within the master lease the bundling feature should provide a similar advantage to us if the master lease tenant is in bankruptcy subject to certain restrictions a debtor in bankruptcy has the right to assume or reject each of its leases it is our intent that a tenant in bankruptcy would be required to assume or reject the master lease as a whole rather than deciding on a property by property basis 

  

 

  

our outpatient medical portfolio is primarily selfmanaged and consists principally of multitenant properties leased to health care providers our leases typically include increasers and some form of operating expense reimbursement by the tenant as of december 31 2016 80 of our portfolio included leases with full pass through 17 with a partial expense reimbursement modified gross and 3 with no expense reimbursement gross our outpatient medical leases are noncancellable operating leases that have a weightedaverage remaining term of seven years at december 31 2016 and are often credit enhanced by security deposits guaranties andor letters of credit   

  

construction we occasionally provide for the construction of properties for tenants as part of longterm operating leases we capitalize certain interest costs associated with funds used for the construction of properties owned by us the amount capitalized is based upon the amount advanced during the construction period using the rate of interest that approximates our companywide cost of financing our interest expense is reduced by the amount capitalized we also typically charge a transaction fee at the commencement of construction which we defer and amortize to income over the term of the resulting lease the construction period commences upon funding and terminates upon the earlier of the completion of the applicable property or the end of a specified period during the construction period we advance funds to the tenants in accordance with agreed upon terms and conditions which require among other things periodic site visits by a company representative during the construction period we generally require an additional credit enhancement in the form of payment and performance bonds andor completion guaranties at december 31 2016 we had outstanding construction investments of 506091000 and were committed to provide additional funds of approximately 493972000 to complete construction for investment properties 

  

real estate loans our real estate loans are typically structured to provide us with interest income principal amortization and transaction fees and are generally secured by firstsecond mortgage liens leasehold mortgages corporate guaranties andor personal guaranties at december 31 2016 we had outstanding real estate loans of 622627508 the interest yield averaged approximately 95 per annum on our outstanding real estate loan balances our yield on real estate loans depends upon a number of factors including the stated interest rate average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments the real estate loans outstanding at december 31 2016 are generally subject to one to 15year terms with principal amortization schedules andor balloon payments of the outstanding principal balances at the end of the term typically real estate loans are crossdefaulted and crosscollateralized with other real estate loans operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its affiliates 

  

  investments in unconsolidated entities  investments in entities that we do not consolidate but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are reported under the equity method of accounting our investments in unconsolidated entities generally represent interests ranging from 10 to 50 in real estate assets under the equity method of accounting our share of the investee’s earnings or losses is included in our consolidated results of operations to the extent that our cost basis is different from the basis reflected at the entity level the basis difference is generally amortized over the lives of the related assets and liabilities and such amortization is included in our share of equity in earnings of the entity the initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated entities is based on the amount paid to purchase the entity interest or the estimated fair value of the assets prior to the sale of interests in the entity we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the equity method investment to its carrying value when we determine a decline in the estimated fair value of such an investment below its carrying value is otherthantemporary an impairment is recorded see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for more information 

  

principles of consolidation 

  the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our whollyowned subsidiaries and joint venture entities that we control through voting rights or other means all material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation 

  at inception of joint venture transactions we identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights “variable interest entities” or “vies” and determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of its operations a vie is broadly defined as an entity where either i the equity investors as a group if any do not have a controlling financial interest or ii the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support we consolidate investments in vies when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary accounting standards codification topic 810 consolidations requires enterprises to perform a qualitative approach to determining whether or not a vie will need to be consolidated on a continuous basis this evaluation is based on an enterprise’s ability to direct and influence the activities of a vie that most significantly impact that entity’s economic performance 

  for investments in joint ventures gaap may preclude consolidation by the sole general partner in certain circumstances based on the type of rights held by the limited partners we assess the limited partners’ rights and their impact on our consolidation conclusions and we reassess if there is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights of the limited partners the sole general partner increases or decreases its ownership of limited partnership interests or there is an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding limited partnership interests we similarly evaluate the rights of managing members of limited liability companies 

  

  

 

  

borrowing policies 

  

we utilize a combination of debt and equity to fund investments our debt and equity levels are determined by management to maintain a conservative balance sheet and credit profile generally we intend to issue unsecured fixedrate public debt with longterm maturities to approximate the maturities on our triplenet leases and investment strategy for shortterm purposes we may borrow on our primary unsecured credit facility we replace these borrowings with longterm capital such as senior unsecured notes or common stock when terms are deemed favorable we may invest in properties subject to existing mortgage indebtedness in addition we may obtain secured financing for unleveraged properties in which we have invested or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis in certain agreements with our lenders we are subject to restrictions with respect to secured and unsecured indebtedness 

  

competition 

  

we compete with other real estate investment trusts real estate partnerships private equity and hedge fund investors banks insurance companies financeinvestment companies governmentsponsored agencies taxable and taxexempt bond funds health care operators developers and other investors in the acquisition development leasing and financing of health care and seniors housing properties we compete for investments based on a number of factors including relationships certainty of execution investment structures and underwriting criteria our ability to successfully compete is impacted by economic and demographic trends availability of acceptable investment opportunities our ability to negotiate beneficial investment terms availability and cost of capital construction and renovation costs and applicable laws and regulations 

  

the operatorstenants of our properties compete with properties that provide comparable services in the local markets operatorstenants compete for patients and residents based on a number of factors including quality of care reputation physical appearance of properties location services offered family preferences physicians staff and price we also face competition from other health care facilities for tenants such as physicians and other health care providers that provide comparable facilities and services

health care industry 

  

the demand for health care services and consequently health care properties is projected to reach unprecedented levels in the near future the centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” projects that national health expenditures will rise to approximately 35 trillion in 2017 or 182 of gross domestic product the average annual growth in national health expenditures for 2015 through 2025 is expected to be 58 while demographics are the primary driver of demand economic conditions and availability of services contribute to health care service utilization rates we believe the health care property market may be less susceptible to fluctuations and economic downturns relative to other property sectors investor interest in the market remains strong especially in specific sectors such as privatepay senior living and outpatient medical buildings the total us population for 2015 through 2025 is projected to increase by 93 the elderly population aged 65 and over is projected to increase by 36 through 2025 the elderly are an important component of health care utilization especially independent living services assisted living services longtermpostacute care services inpatient and outpatient hospital services and physician ambulatory care most health care services are provided within a health care facility such as a hospital a physician’s office or a seniors housing community therefore we believe there will be continued demand for companies such as ours with expertise in health care real estate 

  

health care real estate investment opportunities tend to increase as demand for health care services increases we recognize the need for health care real estate as it correlates to health care service demand health care providers require real estate to house their businesses and expand their services we believe that investment opportunities in health care real estate will continue to be present due to 

·   the specialized nature of the industry which enhances the credibility and experience of the company 

·   the projected population growth combined with stable or increasing health care utilization rates which ensures demand and 

·   the ongoing merger and acquisition activity 

  

certain government regulations 

 

  

  

united states 

  

health law matters — generally 

  

  typically operators of seniors housing facilities do not receive significant funding from government programs and are largely subject to state laws as opposed to federal laws operators of longtermpostacute care facilities and hospitals do receive significant funding from government programs and these facilities are subject to the federal and state laws that regulate the type and quality of the medical andor nursing care provided ancillary services  eg  respiratory occupational physical and infusion therapies qualifications of the administrative personnel and nursing staff the adequacy of the physical plant and equipment reimbursement and rate setting and operating policies in addition as described below operators of these facilities are subject to extensive laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including but not limited to the federal antikickback statute “aks” the federal stark law “stark law” and the federal false claims act “fca” as well as comparable state laws hospitals physician group practice clinics and other health care providers that operate in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal state and local licensure registration certification and inspection laws regulations and industry standards our tenants’ failure to comply with any of these and other laws could result in among other things loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension decertification or exclusion from federal and state health care programs loss of license or closure of the facility see risk factors “the requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid could have a material adverse effect on our obligors’ liquidity financial condition and results of operations which could adversely affect our obligors’ ability to meet their obligations to us” and “our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with federal state local and industryregulated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards could adversely affect such operators’ or tenants’ operations which could adversely affect our operators’ and tenants’ ability to meet their obligations to us” below 

  

licensing and certification 

  

  the primary regulations that affect longterm and postacute care facilities are state licensing and registration laws for example certain health care facilities are subject to a variety of licensure and certificate of need “con” laws and regulations where applicable con laws generally require among other requirements that a facility demonstrate the need for 1 constructing a new facility 2 adding beds or expanding an existing facility 3 investing in major capital equipment or adding new services 4 changing the ownership or control of an existing licensed facility or 5 terminating services that have been previously approved through the con process certain state con laws and regulations may restrict the ability of operators to add new properties or expand an existing facility’s size or services in addition con laws may constrain the ability of an operator to transfer responsibility for operating a particular facility to a new operator 

  

  with respect to licensure generally our longtermpostacute care facilities and acute care facilities are required to be licensed and certified for participation in medicare medicaid and other federal and state health care programs the failure of our operators to maintain or renew any required license or regulatory approval as well as the failure of our operators to correct serious deficiencies identified in a compliance survey could require those operators to discontinue operations at a property in addition if a property is found to be out of compliance with medicare medicaid or other federal or state health care program conditions of participation the property operator may be excluded from participating in those government health care programs 

  

reimbursement 

  

  the reimbursement methodologies applied to health care facilities continue to evolve federal and state authorities have considered and may seek to implement new or modified reimbursement methodologies including valuebased reimbursement methodologies that may negatively impact health care property operations the impact of any such changes if implemented may result in a material adverse effect on our portfolio no assurance can be given that current revenue sources or levels will be maintained accordingly there can be no assurance that payments under a government health care program are currently or will be in the future sufficient to fully reimburse the property operators for their operating and capital expenses 

·   seniors housing facilities excluding longtermpostacute care facilities approximately 55 of our overall revenues for the year ended december 31 2016 were attributable to us seniors housing facilities the majority of the revenues received by the operators of these facilities are from private pay sources the remaining revenue source is primarily medicaid under certain waiver programs as of september 30 2016 15 of our 44 seniors housing operators received medicaid reimbursement pursuant to medicaid waiver programs for the twelve months ended september 30 2016 approximately 17 of the revenues at our seniors housing facilities were from medicaid reimbursement there can be no guarantee that a state medicaid program operating pursuant to a waiver will be able to maintain its waiver status rates paid by selfpay residents are set by the facilities and are determined by local market conditions and operating costs generally facilities receive a higher payment per day for a private pay resident than for a medicaid beneficiary who requires a comparable level of care the level of medicaid reimbursement varies from state to state thus the revenues generated by operators of our assisted living facilities may be adversely affected by payor mix acuity level changes in medicaid eligibility and 

 

  

reimbursement levels in addition a state could lose its medicaid waiver and no longer be permitted to utilize medicaid dollars to reimburse for assisted living services 

·   longtermpostacute care facilities  approximately 13 of our overall revenues for the year ended december 31 2016 were attributable to longtermpostacute care facilities the majority of the revenues received by the operators of these facilities are from the medicare and medicaid programs with the balance representing reimbursement payments from private payors consequently changes in federal or state reimbursement policies may adversely affect an operator’s ability to cover its expenses including our rent or debt service longtermpostacute care facilities are subject to periodic pre and postpayment reviews and other audits by federal and state authorities a review or audit of a property operator’s claims could result in recoupments denials or delay of payments in the future due to the significant judgments and estimates inherent in payor settlement accounting no assurance can be given as to the adequacy of any reserves maintained by our property operators to cover potential adjustments to reimbursements or to cover settlements made to payors recent attention on billing practices payments and quality of care or ongoing government pressure to reduce spending by government health care programs could result in lower payments to longtermpostacute care facilities and as a result may impair an operator’s ability to meet its financial obligations to us 

o   medicare reimbursement   for the twelve months ended september 30 2016 approximately 39 of the revenues at our longtermpostacute care facilities were paid by medicare generally longtermpostacute care facilities are reimbursed under the medicare skilled nursing facility prospective payment system “snf pps” the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system “irf pps” or the long term care hospital prospective payment system “ltch pps” which generally provide reimbursement based upon a predetermined fixed amount per episode of care and are updated by cms an agency of the department of health and human services “hhs” annually cms made some positive payment updates for fiscal year “fy” 2017 under the snf pps the irf pps and the ltch pps specifically 

§   on august 5 2016 cms published a final rule regarding fy 2017 medicare payment policies and rates for skilled nursing facilities “snfs” under the final snf rule cms projects that aggregate payments to snfs will increase in fy 2017 by 920 million or 24 from payments in fy 2016 

§   on august 5 2016 cms published a final rule regarding fy 2017 medicare payment policies and rates for inpatient rehabilitation facilities “irfs” under the rule cms estimates that aggregate payments to irfs will increase in fy 2017 by 145 million or 19 relative to payments in fy 2016 

§   on august 22 2016 cms published a final rule regarding fy 2017 medicare payment policies and rates for long term care hospitals “ltchs” as a result of the continuation of the phasein of site neutral payment rates for specified cases in ltchs cms projects fy 2017 medicare payments to ltchs will decrease by 71 or approximately 363 million payment rates will increase by 07 for cases that qualify for the higher standard ltch pps rate in response to a federal district court’s review of the “twomidnight” payment policy cms finalized its proposal to remove the 02 medicare part a hospital payment cut and also its effects for fys 2014 2015 and 2016 though an approximate 08 increase to fy 2017 payment rates 

there is a risk under these payment systems that costs will exceed the fixed payments or that payments may be set below the costs to provide certain items and services in addition the hhs office of inspector general has released recommendations to address snf billing practices and medicare payment rates if followed these recommendations regarding snf payment reform may impact our tenants and operators 

o   medicaid reimbursement  for the twelve months ended september 30 2016 approximately 33 of the revenues of longtermpostacute care facilities were paid by medicaid many states reimburse snfs for example using fixed daily rates which are applied prospectively based on patient acuity and the historical costs incurred in providing patient care in most states medicaid does not fully reimburse the cost of providing services certain states are attempting to slow the rate of medicaid growth by freezing rates or restricting eligibility and benefits in addition medicaid reimbursement rates may decline if revenues in a particular state are not sufficient to fund budgeted expenditures 

·   medicare reimbursement for physicians hospital outpatient departments and ambulatory surgical centers   changes in reimbursement to physicians hospital outpatient departments “hopds” and ambulatory surgical centers “ascs” may further affect our tenants and operators generally medicare reimburses physicians under the physician fee schedule while hopds and ascs are reimbursed under prospective payment systems the physician fee schedule and the hopd and asc prospective payment systems are updated annually by cms these annual medicare payment regulations have resulted in lower net pay increases than providers of those services have often expected in addition congress recently passed the medicare and chip reauthorization act of 2015 “macra” which includes payment reductions for providers who do not meet government quality standards the implementation of payforquality models like those required under macra is expected to produce funding disparities that could adversely impact some provider tenants in medical buildings and other health care properties changes in medicare advantage plan payments may also indirectly affect our operators and tenants that contract with medicare advantage plans  

·   health reform laws on march 23 2010 president obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the “health reform laws” which dramatically 

 

  

altered how health care is delivered and reimbursed in the united states and contained various provisions including medicaid expansion and the establishment of health insurance exchanges providing subsidized health insurance that may directly impact us or the operators and tenants of our properties we expect that the new presidential administration and us congress will seek to modify repeal or otherwise invalidate all or certain provisions of the health reform laws since taking office president trump has continued to support the repeal of all or portions of the health reform laws the house and senate have recently passed a budget resolution that authorizes congressional committees to draft legislation to repeal all or portions of the health reform laws and permits such legislation to pass with a majority vote in the senate president trump has also recently issued an executive order in which he stated that it is his administration’s policy to seek the prompt repeal of the health reform laws and directed executive departments and federal agencies to waive defer grant exemptions from or delay the implementation of the provisions of the health reform laws to the maximum extent permitted by law there is still uncertainty with respect to the impact president trump’s administration and the us congress may have if any and any changes will likely take time to unfold and could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for health care items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the health reform laws we cannot predict whether the existing health reform laws or future health care reform legislation or regulatory changes will have a material impact on our operators’ or tenants’ property or business 

  

  fraud  abuse enforcement 

  

  longtermpostacute care facilities and seniors housing facilities that receive medicaid payments are subject to federal state and local laws regulations and applicable guidance that govern the operations and financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by health care providers certain of these laws such as the aks and stark law prohibit direct or indirect payments of any kind for the purpose of inducing or encouraging the referral of patients for medical products or services reimbursable by government health care programs other laws require providers to furnish only medically necessary services and submit to the government valid and accurate statements for each service specifically our operators and tenants that receive payments from federal healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid are subject to substantial financial penalties under the civil monetary penalties act and the fca and in particular actions under the fca’s “whistleblower” provisions private enforcement of health care fraud has increased due in large part to amendments to the fca that encourage private individuals to sue on behalf of the government in addition states may also have separate false claims acts which among other things generally prohibit health care providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payments still other laws require providers to comply with a variety of safety health and other requirements relating to the condition of the licensed property and the quality of care provided sanctions for violations of these laws regulations and other applicable guidance may include but are not limited to criminal andor civil penalties and fines loss of licensure immediate termination of government payments exclusion from any government health care program damage assessments and imprisonment in certain circumstances violation of these rules such as those prohibiting abusive and fraudulent behavior with respect to one property may subject other facilities under common control or ownership to sanctions including exclusion from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs as well as other government health care programs in the ordinary course of its business a property operator is regularly subjected to inquiries investigations and audits by the federal and state agencies that oversee these laws and regulations 

  

  prosecutions investigations or whistleblower actions could have a material adverse effect on a property operator’s liquidity financial condition and operations which could adversely affect the ability of the operator to meet its financial obligations to us in addition government investigations and enforcement actions brought against the health care industry have increased dramatically over the past several years and are expected to continue although the responsibility for enforcing these laws and regulations lies with a variety of federal state and local governmental agencies some may be enforced by private litigants through federal and state false claims acts and other laws including some state privacy laws that allow for private individuals to bring actions the costs for an operator of a health care property associated with both defending such enforcement actions and the undertakings in settling these actions can be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its obligations to us 

  

federal and state data privacy and security laws 

  

  the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 as amended by health information technology for economic and clinical health act and numerous other state and federal laws govern the collection security dissemination use access to and confidentiality of individually identifiable health information violations of these laws may result in substantial civil andor criminal fines and penalties 

  

united kingdom 

  

  in england care home services are principally regulated by the health and social care act 2008 as amended and other regulations this legislation subjects service providers to a number of legally binding fundamental standards and requires amongst other things that all persons carrying out regulated activities in england and the managers of such persons be registered providers of care home services are also subject as data controllers to laws governing their use of personal data including in relation 

 

  

to their employees clients and recipients of their services these laws currently take the form of the uks data protection act 1998 enforced by the uks information commissioners office but this will be replaced in mid2018 by the eus new general data protection regulation “gdpr” the gdpr will impose a significant number of new obligations with the potential for fines of up to 4 of annual worldwide turnover or €20 million whichever is greater entities incorporated in or carrying on a business in the uk as well as individuals residing in the uk are also subject to the uk bribery act 2010 the uk recently introduced a new national minimum wage with a maximum fine for nonpayment of £20000 per worker and employers who fail to pay will be banned from being a company director for up to 15 years the uk recently voted to exit from the eu “brexit” negotiations on the exit agreement are underway but at present it is not possible to predict whether brexit will have a material impact on our operators or tenants property or business

·   retirement homes also called independent living are designed for older adults able to live on their own and may offer various lifestyle amenities these residences may be rented privately owned or lifeleased and may be operated for profit or nonprofit support services are not usually offered but can be arranged by residents retirement homes do not generally receive government funding residents pay for tenancy and services received rental subsidies may be available to qualified seniors independent living residences are subject to provincial tenancy and housing laws 

·   supportive living also called assisted living provides homelike accommodation for residents who wish or need to access care assistance and services operators provide at least one meal a day or housekeeping services there are four levels of supportive living addressing care needs from basic to advanced in addition there are two specialized designations of supportive care to address the needs of residents who require the highest level of care including for those who have cognitive impairments supportive living can include seniors lodges group homes and mental health and designated supportive living accommodations which can be operated by private forprofit or notforprofit or public operators supportive living services are licensed and regulated under provincial laws and governed by the ministry of health operators receiving public funds for health and personal care services must also comply with additional provincial legislation and are subject to legislated safeguards aimed at investigation of suspected abuse the maximum accommodation fee in publiclyfunded designated supportive living is regulated by alberta health in other supportive living settings the operator sets the cost of accommodation health services are publiclyfunded and provided through alberta health services private sector operators are eligible to apply for government funding under a government capital grant program that provides funding to develop longterm care and affordable supportive living spaces 

·   nursing homes also called longterm care are for residents who have complex unpredictable medical needs and who require 24hour onsite registered nurse assessment or treatment nursing homes are regulated by provincial laws and governed by the ministry of health operators are not licensed but enter into agreements with the ministry for the operation of nursing homes and must comply with certain accommodation standards homes can be operated by private forprofit or notforprofit or public operators operators that receive public funds for health and personal care services must also comply with certain health service standards and legislation aimed at protecting residents alberta health regulates the maximum accommodation fee in publiclyfunded nursing homes health services in longterm care are publiclyfunded provided through alberta health services private sector operators are eligible to apply for government funding and the minister may make grants to an operator in respect of its operating or capital costs 

  

ontario 

  

  longterm care homes also called nursing homes receive government funding are licensed under provincial law aimed at resident protection and are governed by the ministry of health and longterm care retirement homes are regulated and licensed under a provincial law aimed at protecting residents retirement homes do not receive government funding residents enter into tenancy agreements under provincial tenancy law and pay for tenancy and services received residents may access publiclyfunded external care services at the home from external suppliers retirement home licenses are granted by the retirement homes regulatory authority “rhra” and are nontransferable the rhra administers the law governing retirement homes to ensure that licensees are meeting certain standards generally with respect to care and safety the law requires any person to report to the rhra when there are reasonable grounds to suspect abuse of a resident by anyone or neglect of a resident by staff the rhra conducts a 

 

  

mandatory inspection and issues a report that is posted on the rhra’s public website and also must be posted in the subject home if it is the most recent report the registrar of the rhra can receive complaints about a retirement home contravening a provision of the law and if such a complaint is received it must be reviewed promptly the registrar has broad powers relating to complaint investigation and action the rhra registrar has the power to inspect a retirement home at any time without warning or issue a warrant to ensure compliance compliance inspections occur at least every three years the registrar has the power to make a variety of orders including the imposition of a fine or an order revoking the operator’s license the applicable law also enumerates offenses such as operating without a license and provides for penalties for offenses all of the homes in which we have an interest in ontario are licensed as retirement homes one of the homes also has some licensed longterm care beds 

  

  british columbia 

  

  provincial laws regulate and license “community care facilities” longterm care homes in substantially the same manner as retirement homes are regulated under ontario laws community care facilities are defined as premises used for the purpose of supervising vulnerable persons who require three or more prescribed services from a list that includes regular assistance with activities of daily living distribution of medication management of cash resources monitoring of food intake structured behavior management and intervention and psychosocial or physical rehabilitative therapy 

  

  provincial law also recognizes and regulates “assisted living residences” for seniors who can live independently but require assistance with certain activities services available can include meals housekeeping monitoring and emergency support socialrecreational opportunities and transportation assisted living residences do not require a license but must be registered with the registrar of assisted living residences and must be operated in a manner that does not jeopardize the health or safety of residents if the registrar believes the standard is not being met the registrar may inspect the residence and may suspend or cancel a registration 

  

  independent living residences offer housing and hospitality services for retired adults who are functionally independent and able to direct their own care most of the residences in which we have an interest in bc are assisted living residences with one being an independent living residence   

  

québec 

  

  provincial laws in québec regulate retirement homes private seniors’ residences as well as longterm care homes residential and longterm care centers all homes in which we have an interest in québec are private seniors’ residences which are required to obtain a certificate of compliance based on prescribed operating standards 

  

  a certificate of compliance is issued for a period of four years and is renewable the regional health and social agency may revoke or refuse to issue or renew a certificate of compliance if among other things the operator fails to comply with the applicable law the agency may also order corrective measures further to an inspection complaint or investigation the agency is authorized to inspect a residence at any reasonable time of day in order to ascertain whether it complies with the law 

  

  private seniors’ residences may belong to either or both of the following categories i those offering services to independent elderly persons and ii those offering services to semiindependent elderly persons the operator must for each category comply with the applicable criteria and standards with some exceptions for residences with fewer than six or ten rooms or apartments there are requirements with respect to residents’ health and safety meal services and recreation content of residents’ files disclosure of information to residents and staffing among other things   

  

  other related laws 

  

  privacy 

  

  the services provided in our facilities are subject to privacy legislation in canada including in certain provinces privacy laws specifically related to personal health information although the obligations of custodians of personal information in the various provinces differ they all include the obligation to protect the information the organizations with which we have management agreements may be the custodian of personal information collected in connection with the operation of our facilities 

  

  privacy laws in canada are consentbased and require the implementation of a privacy program involving policies procedures and the designation of an individual or team with primary responsibility for privacy law compliance mandatory breach notification to affected individuals is a requirement under some laws mandatory breach notification to the applicable regulator is a requirement in some provinces some laws require notification where personal information is processed or stored outside of canada one provincial law in quebec provides for fines where an organization fails to perform due diligence before outsourcing activities involving personal information to a service provider outside of the province 

  

 

  

  the powers of privacy regulators and penalties for violations of privacy law vary according to the applicable law or are left to the courts to date monetary penalties granted have been on the low side although that is changing with civil actions for breach of privacy and may change further as a result of class action activity regulators have the authority to make public the identity of a custodian that has been found to have committed a breach so there is a reputational risk associated with privacy law violations even where no monetary damages are incurred the notification of residents mandatory under some privacy laws and other activities required to manage a privacy breach can give rise to significant costs 

  

  other legislation 

  

  retirement homes may be subject to residential tenancy laws such that there can be restrictions on rent increases and termination of tenancies for instance other provincial andor municipal laws applicable to fire safety food services zoning occupational health and safety public health and the provision of community health care and funded longtermpostacute care may also apply to retirement homes

general 

  

we elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust a “reit” commencing with our first taxable year we intend to continue to operate in such a manner as to qualify as a reit but there is no guarantee that we will qualify or remain qualified as a reit for subsequent years qualification and taxation as a reit depends upon our ability to meet a variety of qualification tests imposed under federal income tax law with respect to income assets distribution level and diversity of share ownership as discussed below under “— qualification as a reit” there can be no assurance that we will be owned and organized and will operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified 

  

in any year in which we qualify as a reit in general we will not be subject to federal income tax on that portion of our reit taxable income or capital gain that is distributed to stockholders we may however be subject to tax at normal corporate rates on any taxable income or capital gain not distributed if we elect to retain and pay income tax on our net longterm capital gains stockholders are required to include their proportionate share of our undistributed longterm capital gains in income but they will receive a refundable credit for their share of any taxes paid by us on such gain 

  

despite the reit election we may be subject to federal income and excise tax as follows 

• to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our “reit taxable income” as adjusted we will be subject to tax on the undistributed amount at regular corporate tax rates 

• we may be subject to the “alternative minimum tax” the “amt” on certain tax preference items to the extent that the amt exceeds our regular tax 

• if we have net income from the sale or other disposition of “foreclosure property” that is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business or other nonqualifying income from foreclosure property such income will be taxed at the highest corporate rate 

• any net income from prohibited transactions which are in general sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business other than dispositions of foreclosure property and dispositions of property due to an involuntary conversion will be subject to a 100 tax 

 

  

• if we fail to satisfy either the 75 or 95 gross income tests as discussed below but nonetheless maintain our qualification as a reit because certain other requirements are met we will be subject to a 100 tax on an amount equal to 1 the gross income attributable to the greater of i 75 of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75 gross income test discussed below or ii 95 of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 95 gross income test discussed below multiplied by 2 a fraction intended to reflect our profitability 

• if we fail to distribute during each year at least the sum of 1 85 of our reit ordinary income for the year 2 95 of our reit capital gain net income for such year other than capital gain that we elect to retain and pay tax on and 3 any undistributed taxable income from preceding periods we will be subject to a 4 excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over amounts actually distributed 

• we will be subject to a 100 tax on the amount of any rents from real property deductions or excess interest paid to us by any of our “taxable reit subsidiaries” that would be reduced through reallocation under certain federal income tax principles in order to more clearly reflect income of the taxable reit subsidiary see “— qualification as a reit — investments in taxable reit subsidiaries” and 

• we may be subject to the corporate “alternative minimum tax” on any items of tax preference including any deductions of net operating losses 

  

if we acquire any assets from a corporation which is or has been a “c” corporation in a carryover basis transaction we could be liable for specified liabilities that are inherited from the “c” corporation a “c” corporation is generally defined as a corporation that is required to pay full corporate level federal income tax if we recognize gain on the disposition of the assets during the fiveyear period beginning on the date on which the assets were acquired by us then to the extent of the assets’ “builtin gain” ie the excess of the fair market value of the asset over the adjusted tax basis in the asset in each case determined as of the beginning of the fiveyear period we will be subject to tax on the gain at the highest regular corporate rate applicable the results described in this paragraph with respect to the recognition of builtin gain assume that the builtin gain assets at the time the builtin gain assets were subject to a conversion transaction either where a “c” corporation elected reit status or a reit acquired the assets from a “c” corporation were not treated as sold to an unrelated party and gain recognized for those properties that are subject to the builtingains tax if triggered by a sale within the fiveyear period beginning on the date on which the properties were acquired by us then the potential amount of builtingains tax will be an additional factor when considering a possible sale of the properties see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the builtin gains tax 

  

qualification as a reit 

  

a reit is defined as a corporation trust or association 

1 which is managed by one or more trustees or directors 

2 the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest 

3 which would be taxable as a domestic corporation but for the federal income tax law relating to reits 

4 which is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company 

5 the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons in each taxable year of the reit except for its first taxable year 

6 not more than 50 in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned during the last half of each taxable year excluding its first taxable year directly or indirectly by or for five or fewer individuals which includes certain entities the “five or fewer requirement” and 

7 which meets certain income and asset tests described below 

  

conditions 1 to 4 inclusive must be met during the entire taxable year and condition 5 must be met during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months for purposes of conditions 5 and 6 pension funds and certain other taxexempt entities are treated as individuals subject to a “lookthrough” exception in the case of condition 6 

  

based on publicly available information we believe we have satisfied the share ownership requirements set forth in 5 and 6 above in addition article vi of our bylaws provides for restrictions regarding ownership and transfer of shares these restrictions are intended to assist us in continuing to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in 5 and 6 above these restrictions however may not ensure that we will in all cases be able to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in 5 and 6 above 

  

we have complied with and will continue to comply with regulatory rules to send annual letters to certain of our stockholders requesting information regarding the actual ownership of our stock if despite sending the annual letters we do not know or after exercising reasonable diligence would not have known whether we failed to meet the five or fewer requirement we will be treated as having met the five or fewer requirement if we fail to comply with these regulatory rules we will be subject to a monetary penalty if our failure to comply was due to intentional disregard of the requirement the penalty would be increased however if our failure to comply were due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect no penalty would be imposed 

 

  

  

we may own a number of properties through wholly owned subsidiaries a corporation will qualify as a “qualified reit subsidiary” if 100 of its stock is owned by a reit and the reit does not elect to treat the subsidiary as a taxable reit subsidiary a “qualified reit subsidiary” will not be treated as a separate corporation and all assets liabilities and items of income deductions and credits of a “qualified reit subsidiary” will be treated as assets liabilities and items as the case may be of the reit a “qualified reit subsidiary” is not subject to federal income tax and our ownership of the voting stock of a qualified reit subsidiary will not violate the restrictions against ownership of securities of any one issuer which constitute more than 10 of the value or total voting power of such issuer or more than 5 of the value of our total assets as described below under “— asset tests” 

  

if we invest in a partnership a limited liability company or a trust taxed as a partnership or as a disregarded entity we will be deemed to own a proportionate share of the partnership’s limited liability company’s or trust’s assets likewise we will be treated as receiving our share of the income and loss of the partnership limited liability company or trust and the gross income will retain the same character in our hands as it has in the hands of the partnership limited liability company or trust these “lookthrough” rules apply for purposes of the income tests and assets tests described below 

  

income tests there are two separate percentage tests relating to our sources of gross income that we must satisfy each taxable year 

• at least 75 of our gross income excluding gross income from certain sales of property held primarily for sale must be directly or indirectly derived each taxable year from “rents from real property” other income from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property or certain income from qualified temporary investments 

• at least 95 of our gross income excluding gross income from certain sales of property held primarily for sale must be directly or indirectly derived each taxable year from any of the sources qualifying for the 75 gross income test and from dividends including dividends from taxable reit subsidiaries and interest 

  

as to transactions entered into in taxable years beginning after october 22 2004 and on or prior to july 30 2008 any of our income from a “clearly identified” hedging transaction that is entered into by us in the normal course of business directly or indirectly to manage the risk of interest rate movements price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings or obligations incurred or to be incurred by us or such other risks that are prescribed by the internal revenue service is excluded from the 95 gross income test 

  

for transactions entered into after july 30 2008 any of our income from a “clearly identified” hedging transaction that is entered into by us in the normal course of business directly or indirectly to manage the risk of interest rate movements price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings or obligations incurred or to be incurred by us is excluded from the 95 and 75 gross income tests for transactions entered into after july 30 2008 any of our income from a “clearly identified” hedging transaction entered into by us primarily to manage risk of currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain that is included in gross income in the 95 and 75 gross income tests is excluded from the 95 and 75 gross income tests 

  

in general a hedging transaction is “clearly identified” if 1 the transaction is identified as a hedging transaction before the end of the day on which it is entered into and 2 the items or risks being hedged are identified “substantially contemporaneously” with the hedging transaction an identification is not substantially contemporaneous if it is made more than 35 days after entering into the hedging transaction 

  

as to gains and items of income recognized after july 30 2008 “passive foreign exchange gain” for any taxable year will not constitute gross income for purposes of the 95 gross income test and “real estate foreign exchange gain” for any taxable year will not constitute gross income for purposes of the 75 gross income test real estate foreign exchange gain is foreign currency gain as defined in internal revenue code section 988b1 which is attributable to i any qualifying item of income or gain for purposes of the 75 gross income test ii the acquisition or ownership of obligations secured by mortgages on real property or interests in real property or iii becoming or being the obligor under obligations secured by mortgages on real property or on interests in real property real estate foreign exchange gain also includes internal revenue code section 987 gain attributable to a qualified business unit a “qbu” of a reit if the qbu itself meets the 75 gross income test for the taxable year and the 75 asset test at the close of each quarter that the reit has directly or indirectly held the qbu real estate foreign exchange gain also includes any other foreign currency gain as determined by the secretary of the treasury passive foreign exchange gain includes all real estate foreign exchange gain and foreign currency gain which is attributable to i any qualifying item of income or gain for purposes of the 95 gross income test ii the acquisition or ownership of obligations iii becoming or being the obligor under obligations and iv any other foreign currency gain as determined by the secretary of the treasury 

  

generally other than income from “clearly identified” hedging transactions entered into by us in the normal course of business any foreign currency gain derived by us from dealing or engaging in substantial and regular trading in securities will constitute gross income which does not qualify under the 95 or 75 gross income tests 

  

 

  

rents received by us will qualify as “rents from real property” for purposes of satisfying the gross income tests for a reit only if several conditions are met 

• the amount of rent must not be based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person although rents generally will not be excluded merely because they are based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales 

• rents received from a tenant will not qualify as rents from real property if the reit or an owner of 10 or more of the reit also directly or constructively owns 10 or more of the tenant unless the tenant is our taxable reit subsidiary and certain other requirements are met with respect to the real property being rented 

• if rent attributable to personal property leased in connection with a lease of real property is greater than 15 of the total rent received under the lease then the portion of rent attributable to such personal property will not qualify as “rents from real property” 

• for rents to qualify as rents from real property we generally must not furnish or render services to tenants other than through a taxable reit subsidiary or an “independent contractor” from whom we derive no income except that we may directly provide services that are “usually or customarily rendered” in the geographic area in which the property is located in connection with the rental of real property for occupancy only or are not otherwise considered “rendered to the occupant for his convenience” 

• for taxable years beginning after july 30 2008 the reit may lease “ qualified health care properties” on an arm’slength basis to a taxable reit subsidiary if the property is operated on behalf of such subsidiary by a person who qualifies as an “independent contractor” and who is or is related to a person who is actively engaged in the trade or business of operating health care facilities for any person unrelated to us or our taxable reit subsidiary an “ eligible independent contractor  ” generally the rent that the reit receives from the taxable reit subsidiary will be treated as “rents from real property”   a “qualified health care property” includes any real property and any personal property that is or is necessary or incidental to the use of a hospital nursing facility assisted living facility congregate care facility qualified continuing care facility or other licensed facility that extends medical or nursing or ancillary services to patients and is operated by a provider of such services that is eligible for participation in the medicare program with respect to such facility 

  

a reit is permitted to render a de minimis amount of impermissible services to tenants and still treat amounts received with respect to that property as rent from real property the amount received or accrued by the reit during the taxable year for the impermissible services with respect to a property may not exceed 1 of all amounts received or accrued by the reit directly or indirectly from the property the amount received for any service or management operation for this purpose shall be deemed to be not less than 150 of the direct cost of the reit in furnishing or rendering the service or providing the management or operation furthermore impermissible services may be furnished to tenants by a taxable reit subsidiary subject to certain conditions and we may still treat rents received with respect to the property as rent from real property 

  

the term “interest” generally does not include any amount if the determination of the amount depends in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person although an amount generally will not be excluded from the term “interest” solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage of receipts or sales 

  

if we fail to satisfy one or both of the 75 or 95 gross income tests for any taxable year we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for such year if we are eligible for relief these relief provisions generally will be available if 1 following our identification of the failure we file a schedule for such taxable year describing each item of our gross income and 2 the failure to meet such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect it is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions if these relief provisions apply a 100 tax is imposed on an amount equal to a the gross income attributable to 1 75 of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75 income test and 2 95 of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 95 income test multiplied by b a fraction intended to reflect our profitability the secretary of the treasury is given broad authority to determine whether particular items of income or gain qualify or not under the 75 and 95 gross income tests or are to be excluded from the measure of gross income for such purposes 

  

asset tests within 30 days after the close of each quarter of our taxable year we must also satisfy several tests relating to the nature and diversification of our assets determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles at least 75 of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets cash cash items including receivables arising in the ordinary course of our operation government securities and qualified temporary investments although the remaining 25 of our assets generally may be invested without restriction we are prohibited from owning securities representing more than 10 of either the vote the “10 vote test” or value the “10 value test” of the outstanding securities of any issuer other than a qualified reit subsidiary another reit or a taxable reit subsidiary further no more than 25 20 for tax years beginning after 2017 of the total assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries the “25 asset test” and no more than 5 of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities of any nongovernmental issuer other than a qualified reit subsidiary the “5 asset test” another reit or a taxable reit subsidiary each of the 10 vote test the 10 value test and the 25 and 5 asset tests must be satisfied at the end of each quarter there are special rules which provide relief if the value related tests are not satisfied due to changes in the value of the assets of a reit 

  

certain items are excluded from the 10 value test including 1 straight debt securities as defined in internal revenue code section 1361c5 of an issuer including straight debt that provides certain contingent payments 2 any loan to an individual or an 

 

  

estate 3 any rental agreement described in section 467 of the internal revenue code other than with a “related person” 4 any obligation to pay rents from real property 5 certain securities issued by a state or any subdivision thereof the district of columbia a foreign government or any political subdivision thereof or the commonwealth of puerto rico 6 any security issued by a reit and 7 any other arrangement that as determined by the secretary of the treasury is excepted from the definition of security “excluded securities” special rules apply to straight debt securities issued by corporations and entities taxable as partnerships for federal income tax purposes if a reit or its taxable reit subsidiary holds 1 straight debt securities of a corporate or partnership issuer and 2 securities of such issuer that are not excluded securities and have an aggregate value greater than 1 of such issuer’s outstanding securities the straight debt securities will be included in the 10 value test 

  

a reit’s interest as a partner in a partnership is not treated as a security for purposes of applying the 10 value test to securities issued by the partnership further any debt instrument issued by a partnership will not be a security for purposes of applying the 10 value test 1 to the extent of the reit’s interest as a partner in the partnership and 2 if at least 75 of the partnership’s gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions would qualify for the 75 gross income test for purposes of the 10 value test a reit’s interest in a partnership’s assets is determined by the reit’s proportionate interest in any securities issued by the partnership other than the excluded securities described in the preceding paragraph 

  

for taxable years beginning after july 30 2008 if the reit or its qbu uses a foreign currency as its functional currency the term “cash” includes such foreign currency but only to the extent such foreign currency is i held for use in the normal course of the activities of the reit or qbu which give rise to items of income or gain that are included in the 95 and 75 gross income tests or are directly related to acquiring or holding assets qualifying under the 75 asset test and ii not held in connection with dealing or engaging in substantial and regular trading in securities 

  

with respect to corrections of failures as to violations of the 10 vote test the 10 value test or the 5 asset test a reit may avoid disqualification as a reit by disposing of sufficient assets to cure a violation that does not exceed the lesser of 1 of the reit’s assets at the end of the relevant quarter or 10000000 provided that the disposition occurs within six months following the last day of the quarter in which the reit first identified the assets for violations of any of the reit asset tests due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that exceed the thresholds described in the preceding sentence a reit can avoid disqualification as a reit after the close of a taxable quarter by taking certain steps including disposition of sufficient assets within the six month period described above to meet the applicable asset test paying a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets during the period of time that the assets were held as nonqualifying assets and filing a schedule with the internal revenue service that describes the nonqualifying assets 

  

investments in taxable reit subsidiaries   reits may own more than 10 of the voting power and value of securities in taxable reit subsidiaries unlike a qualified reit subsidiary other disregarded entity or partnership the income and assets of a taxable reit subsidiary are not attributable to the reit for purposes of satisfying the income and asset ownership requirements applicable to reit qualification we and any taxable corporate entity in which we own an interest are allowed to jointly elect to treat such entity as a “taxable reit subsidiary” 

  

certain of our subsidiaries have elected to be treated as a taxable reit subsidiary taxable reit subsidiaries are subject to full corporate level federal taxation on their earnings but are permitted to engage in certain types of activities that cannot be performed directly by reits without jeopardizing their reit status our taxable reit subsidiaries will attempt to minimize the amount of these taxes but there can be no assurance whether or the extent to which measures taken to minimize taxes will be successful to the extent our taxable reit subsidiaries are required to pay federal state or local taxes the cash available for distribution as dividends to us from our taxable reit subsidiaries will be reduced 

  

the amount of interest on relatedparty debt that a taxable reit subsidiary may deduct is limited further a 100 tax applies to any interest payments by a taxable reit subsidiary to its affiliated reit to the extent the interest rate is not commercially reasonable a taxable reit subsidiary is permitted to deduct interest payments to unrelated parties without any of these restrictions 

  

the internal revenue service may reallocate costs between a reit and its taxable reit subsidiary where there is a lack of arm’slength dealing between the parties any deductible expenses allocated away from a taxable reit subsidiary would increase its tax liability further any amount by which a reit understates its deductions and overstates those of its taxable reit subsidiary may subject to certain exceptions be subject to a 100 tax additional taxable reit subsidiary elections may be made in the future for additional entities in which we obtain an interest 

  

  annual distribution requirements in order to avoid being taxed as a regular corporation we are required to make distributions other than capital gain distributions to our stockholders which qualify for the dividends paid deduction in an amount at least equal to 1 the sum of i 90 of our “reit taxable income” computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain and ii 90 of the aftertax net income if any from foreclosure property minus 2 a portion of certain items of noncash income these distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for that year and if paid on or before the first regular distribution payment after such declaration prior to recently enacted legislation with respect to all reits the amount distributed could not be preferential this means that every stockholder of the class of stock to which a distribution is made must be treated the same as every other stockholder of that class and 

 

  

no class of stock may be treated otherwise than in accordance with its dividend rights as a class the “preferential dividend rule” beginning in tax years after 2014 the preferential dividend rule no longer applies to publicly offered reits however the rule is still applicable to other entities taxed as reits which would include several of our subsidiaries to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our “reit taxable income” as adjusted we will be subject to tax on the undistributed amount at regular corporate tax rates as discussed above we may be subject to an excise tax if we fail to meet certain other distribution requirements we believe we have satisfied the annual distribution requirements for the year of our initial reit election and each year thereafter through the year ended december 31 2016 although we intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy these annual distribution requirements for subsequent years economic market legal tax or other factors could limit our ability to meet those requirements see “item 1a — risk factors” 

  

it is also possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90 distribution requirement or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation due to among other things 1 timing differences between i the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses and ii the inclusion of income and deduction of expenses in arriving at our taxable income or 2 the payment of severance benefits that may not be deductible to us in the event that timing differences occur we may find it necessary to arrange for borrowings or if possible pay dividends in the form of taxable stock dividends in order to meet the distribution requirement 

  

under certain circumstances in the event of a deficiency determined by the internal revenue service we may be able to rectify a resulting failure to meet the distribution requirement for a year by paying “deficiency dividends” to stockholders in a later year which may be included in our deduction for distributions paid for the earlier year thus we may be able to avoid being taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends however we will be required to pay applicable penalties and interest based upon the amount of any deduction taken for deficiency dividend distributions 

  

  failure to qualify as a reit 

  

if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates distributions to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify as a reit will not be deductible nor will any particular amount of distributions be required to be made in any year all distributions to stockholders will be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these distributions and subject to certain limitations will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporate stockholders unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions we also will be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to statutory relief failure to qualify for even one year could result in our need to incur indebtedness or liquidate investments in order to pay potentially significant resulting tax liabilities 

  

in addition to the relief described above under “— income tests” and “— asset tests” relief is available in the event that we violate a provision of the internal revenue code that would result in our failure to qualify as a reit if 1 the violation is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect 2 we pay a penalty of 50000 for each failure to satisfy the provision and 3 the violation does not include a violation described under “— income tests” or “— asset tests” above it is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions 

  

federal income taxation of holders of our stock 

  

treatment of taxable us stockholders the following summary applies to you only if you are a “us stockholder” a “us stockholder” is a holder of shares of stock who for united states federal income tax purposes is 

• a citizen or resident of the united states 

• a corporation partnership or other entity classified as a corporation or partnership for these purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the united states or of any political subdivision of the united states including any state 

• an estate the income of which is subject to united states federal income taxation regardless of its source or 

• a trust if in general a us court is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or more us persons within the meaning of the internal revenue code has the authority to control all of the trust’s substantial decisions 

  

so long as we qualify for taxation as a reit distributions on shares of our stock made out of the current or accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these distributions and not designated as capital gain dividends will be includable as ordinary income for federal income tax purposes none of these distributions will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for us corporate stockholders 

  

generally the current maximum marginal rate of tax payable by individuals on dividends received from corporations that are subject to a corporate level of tax is 20 except in limited circumstances this tax rate will not apply to dividends paid to you by us on our shares because generally we are not subject to federal income tax on the portion of our reit taxable income or capital gains 

 

  

distributed to our stockholders the reduced maximum federal income tax rate will apply to that portion if any of dividends received by you with respect to our shares that are attributable to 1 dividends received by us from nonreit corporations or other taxable reit subsidiaries 2 income from the prior year with respect to which we were required to pay federal corporate income tax during the prior year if for example we did not distribute 100 of our reit taxable income for the prior year or 3 the amount of any earnings and profits that were distributed by us and accumulated in a nonreit year 

  

distributions that are designated as capital gain dividends will be taxed as longterm capital gains to the extent they do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year without regard to the period for which you held our stock however if you are a corporation you may be required to treat a portion of some capital gain dividends as ordinary income 

  

if we elect to retain and pay income tax on any net longterm capital gain you would include in income as longterm capital gain your proportionate share of this net longterm capital gain you would also receive a refundable tax credit for your proportionate share of the tax paid by us on such retained capital gains and you would have an increase in the basis of your shares of our stock in an amount equal to your includable capital gains less your share of the tax deemed paid 

  

you may not include in your federal income tax return any of our net operating losses or capital losses federal income tax rules may also require that certain minimum tax adjustments and preferences be apportioned to you in addition any distribution declared by us in october november or december of any year on a specified date in any such month shall be treated as both paid by us and received by you on december 31 of that year provided that the distribution is actually paid by us no later than january 31 of the following year 

  

we will be treated as having sufficient earnings and profits to treat as a dividend any distribution up to the amount required to be distributed in order to avoid imposition of the 4 excise tax discussed under “— general” and “— qualification as a reit — annual distribution requirements” above as a result you may be required to treat as taxable dividends certain distributions that would otherwise result in a taxfree return of capital moreover any “deficiency dividend” will be treated as a dividend an ordinary dividend or a capital gain dividend as the case may be regardless of our earnings and profits any other distributions in excess of current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to you to the extent these distributions do not exceed the adjusted tax basis of your shares of our stock you will be required to reduce the tax basis of your shares of our stock by the amount of these distributions until the basis has been reduced to zero after which these distributions will be taxable as capital gain if the shares of our stock are held as capital assets the tax basis as so reduced will be used in computing the capital gain or loss if any realized upon sale of the shares of our stock any loss upon a sale or exchange of shares of our stock which were held for six months or less after application of certain holding period rules will generally be treated as a longterm capital loss to the extent you previously received capital gain distributions with respect to these shares of our stock 

  

upon the sale or exchange of any shares of our stock to or with a person other than us or a sale or exchange of all shares of our stock whether actually or constructively owned with us you will generally recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your adjusted tax basis in these shares of our stock this gain will be capital gain if you held these shares of our stock as a capital asset 

  

if we redeem any of your shares in us the treatment can only be determined on the basis of particular facts at the time of redemption in general you will recognize gain or loss as opposed to dividend income equal to the difference between the amount received by you in the redemption and your adjusted tax basis in your shares redeemed if such redemption 1 results in a “complete termination” of your interest in all classes of our equity securities 2 is a “substantially disproportionate redemption” or 3 is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” with respect to you in applying these tests you must take into account your ownership of all classes of our equity securities eg common stock preferred stock depositary shares and warrants you also must take into account any equity securities that are considered to be constructively owned by you 

  

if as a result of a redemption by us of your shares you no longer own either actually or constructively any of our equity securities or only own actually and constructively an insubstantial percentage of our equity securities then it is probable that the redemption of your shares would be considered “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” and thus would result in gain or loss to you however whether a distribution is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” depends on all of the facts and circumstances and if you rely on any of these tests at the time of redemption you should consult your tax advisor to determine their application to the particular situation 

  

generally if the redemption does not meet the tests described above then the proceeds received by you from the redemption of your shares will be treated as a distribution taxable as a dividend to the extent of the allocable portion of current or accumulated earnings and profits if the redemption is taxed as a dividend your adjusted tax basis in the redeemed shares will be transferred to any other shareholdings in us that you own if you own no other shareholdings in us under certain circumstances such basis may be transferred to a related person or it may be lost entirely 

  

 

  

gain from the sale or exchange of our shares held for more than one year is generally taxed at a maximum longterm capital gain rate of 20 in the case of stockholders who are individuals and 35 in the case of stockholders that are corporations pursuant to internal revenue service guidance we may classify portions of our capital gain dividends as gains eligible for the longterm capital gains rate or as gain taxable to individual stockholders at a maximum rate of 25 capital losses recognized by a stockholder upon the disposition of our shares held for more than one year at the time of disposition will be considered longterm capital losses and are generally available only to offset capital gain income of the stockholder but not ordinary income except in the case of individuals who may offset up to 3000 of ordinary income each year 

  

an additional tax of 38 generally will be imposed on the “net investment income” of us stockholders who meet certain requirements and are individuals estates or certain trusts among other items “net investment income” generally includes gross income from dividends and net gain attributable to the disposition of certain property such as shares of our common stock or warrants in the case of individuals this tax will only apply to the extent such individual’s modified adjusted gross income exceeds 200000 250000 for married couples filing a joint return and surviving spouses and 125000 for married individuals filing a separate return us stockholders should consult their tax advisors regarding the possible applicability of this additional tax in their particular circumstances 

  

treatment of taxexempt us stockholders taxexempt entities including qualified employee pension and profit sharing trusts and individual retirement accounts “exempt organizations” generally are exempt from federal income taxation however they are subject to taxation on their unrelated business taxable income “ubti” the internal revenue service has issued a published revenue ruling that dividend distributions from a reit to an exempt employee pension trust do not constitute ubti provided that the shares of the reit are not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business of the exempt employee pension trust based on this ruling amounts distributed by us to exempt organizations generally should not constitute ubti however if an exempt organization finances its acquisition of the shares of our stock with debt a portion of its income from us will constitute ubti pursuant to the “debt financed property” rules likewise a portion of the exempt organization’s income from us would constitute ubti if we held a residual interest in a real estate mortgage investment conduit 

  

in addition in certain circumstances a pension trust that owns more than 10 of our stock is required to treat a percentage of our dividends as ubti this rule applies to a pension trust holding more than 10 of our stock only if 1 the percentage of our income that is ubti determined as if we were a pension trust is at least 5 2 we qualify as a reit by reason of the modification of the five or fewer requirement that allows beneficiaries of the pension trust to be treated as holding shares in proportion to their actuarial interests in the pension trust and 3 either i one pension trust owns more than 25 of the value of our stock or ii a group of pension trusts individually holding more than 10 of the value of our stock collectively own more than 50 of the value of our stock 

  

backup withholding and information reporting under certain circumstances you may be subject to backup withholding at applicable rates on payments made with respect to or cash proceeds of a sale or exchange of shares of our stock backup withholding will apply only if you 1 fail to provide a correct taxpayer identification number which if you are an individual is ordinarily your social security number 2 furnish an incorrect taxpayer identification number 3 are notified by the internal revenue service that you have failed to properly report payments of interest or dividends or 4 fail to certify under penalties of perjury that you have furnished a correct taxpayer identification number and that the internal revenue service has not notified you that you are subject to backup withholding 

  

backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients such as corporations and taxexempt organizations you should consult with a tax advisor regarding qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining an exemption backup withholding is not an additional tax rather the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a stockholder will be allowed as a credit against such stockholder’s united states federal income tax liability and may entitle such stockholder to a refund provided that the required information is provided to the internal revenue service in addition withholding a portion of capital gain distributions made to stockholders may be required for stockholders who fail to certify their nonforeign status 

  

taxation of foreign stockholders the following summary applies to you only if you are a foreign person the federal taxation of foreign persons is a highly complex matter that may be affected by many considerations 

  

except as discussed below distributions to you of cash generated by our real estate operations in the form of ordinary dividends but not by the sale or exchange of our capital assets generally will be subject to us withholding tax at a rate of 30 unless an applicable tax treaty reduces that tax and you file with us the required form evidencing the lower rate 

  

in general you will be subject to united states federal income tax on a graduated rate basis rather than withholding with respect to your investment in our stock if such investment is “effectively connected” with your conduct of a trade or business in the united states a corporate foreign stockholder that receives income that is or is treated as effectively connected with a united states trade or business may also be subject to the branch profits tax which is payable in addition to regular united states corporate income tax the following discussion will apply to foreign stockholders whose investment in us is not so effectively connected we expect to withhold united states income tax as described below on the gross amount of any distributions paid to you unless 1 you file an internal revenue service form w8eci with us claiming that the distribution is “effectively connected” or 2 certain other exceptions apply 

 

  

  

distributions by us that are attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a united states real property interest will be taxed to you under the foreign investment in real property tax act of 1980 “firpta” as if these distributions were gains “effectively connected” with a united states trade or business accordingly you will be taxed at the normal capital gain rates applicable to a us stockholder on these amounts subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals distributions subject to firpta may also be subject to a branch profits tax in the hands of a corporate foreign stockholder that is not entitled to treaty exemption 

  

we will be required to withhold from distributions subject to firpta and remit to the internal revenue service 35 of designated capital gain dividends or if greater 35 of the amount of any distributions that could be designated as capital gain dividends in addition if we designate prior distributions as capital gain dividends subsequent distributions up to the amount of the prior distributions not withheld against will be treated as capital gain dividends for purposes of withholding 

  

any capital gain dividend with respect to any class of stock that is “regularly traded” on an established securities market will be treated as an ordinary dividend if the foreign stockholder did not own more than 10 of such class of stock at any time during the taxable year foreign stockholders generally will not be required to report distributions received from us on us federal income tax returns and all distributions treated as dividends for us federal income tax purposes including any such capital gain dividends will be subject to a 30 us withholding tax unless reduced under an applicable income tax treaty as discussed above in addition the branch profits tax will not apply to such distributions 

  

unless our shares constitute a “united states real property interest” within the meaning of firpta or are effectively connected with a us trade or business a sale of our shares by you generally will not be subject to united states taxation though under the protecting americans from tax hikes act of 2015 the “path act” enacted on december 18 2015 even if our shares were to constitute a “united states real property interest” nonus stockholders that are “qualified foreign pension funds” or are owned by a qualified foreign pension meeting certain requirements may be exempt from firpta withholding on the sale or disposition of our shares our shares will not constitute a united states real property interest if we qualify as a “domestically controlled reit” we believe that we and expect to continue to qualify as a domestically controlled reit a domestically controlled reit is a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50 in value of its shares is held directly or indirectly by foreign stockholders generally under the path act we are permitted to assume that holders of less than 5 of our shares at all times during a specified testing period are us persons however if you are a nonresident alien individual who is present in the united states for 183 days or more during the taxable year and certain other conditions apply you will be subject to a 30 tax on such capital gains in any event a purchaser of our shares from you will not be required under firpta to withhold on the purchase price if the purchased shares are “regularly traded” on an established securities market or if we are a domestically controlled reit otherwise under firpta the purchaser may be required to withhold 10 increased to 15 under the path act for distributions occurring after february 16 2016 of the purchase price and remit such amount to the internal revenue service 

  

backup withholding tax and information reporting will generally not apply to distributions paid to you outside the united states that are treated as 1 dividends to which the 30 or lower treaty rate withholding tax discussed above applies 2 capital gains dividends or 3 distributions attributable to gain from the sale or exchange by us of us real property interests payment of the proceeds of a sale of stock within the united states or conducted through certain us related financial intermediaries is subject to both backup withholding and information reporting unless the beneficial owner certifies under penalties of perjury that he or she is not a us person and the payor does not have actual knowledge that the beneficial owner is a us person or otherwise established an exemption you may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for refund with the internal revenue service

changes in applicable tax regulations could negatively affect our financial results 

  

the company is subject to taxation in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions because the us maintains a worldwide corporate tax system the foreign and us tax systems are somewhat interdependent longstanding international tax norms that determine each country’s jurisdiction to tax crossborder international trade are evolving such as the base erosion and profit shifting project “beps currently being undertaken by the g8 g20 and organization for economic cooperation and development tax changes pursuant to beps could reduce the ability of our foreign subsidiaries to deduct for foreign tax purposes the interest they pay on loans from the company thereby increasing the foreign tax liability of the subsidiaries it is also possible that foreign countries could increase their withholding taxes on dividends and interest given the unpredictability of these possible changes and their potential interdependency it is very difficult to assess the overall effect of such potential tax changes on our earnings and cash flow but such changes could adversely impact our financial results

 item 1a risk factors 

  

  this section discusses the most significant factors that affect our business operations and financial condition it does not describe all risks and uncertainties applicable to us our industry or ownership of our securities if any of the following risks as well as other risks and uncertainties that are not yet identified or that we currently think are not material actually occur we could be materially adversely affected in that event the value of our securities could decline we group these risk factors into three categories 

•   risks arising from our business 

•   risks arising from our capital structure and 

•   risks arising from our status as a reit 

  

risks arising from our business 

  

our investments in and acquisitions of health care and seniors housing properties may be unsuccessful or fail to meet our expectations 

  

  we are exposed to the risk that some of our acquisitions may not prove to be successful we could encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired properties including contingent liabilities and acquired properties might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business if we agree to provide construction funding to an operatortenant and the project is not completed we may need to take steps to ensure completion of the project such expenditures may negatively affect our results of operations furthermore there can be no assurance that our anticipated acquisitions and investments the completion of which is subject to various conditions will be consummated in accordance with anticipated timing on anticipated terms or at all we also may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties into our existing operations and this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

our investments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by our lack of exclusive control over these investments our partners’ insolvency or failure to meet their obligations and disputes between us and our partners 

 

  

  

  we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into partnerships or joint ventures with other persons or entities joint venture investments involve risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership including the possibility that our partner might become insolvent refuse to make capital contributions when due or otherwise fail to meet its obligations which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments that our partner might at any time have economic or other business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our interests or goals that we could become engaged in a dispute with our partner which could require us to expend additional resources to resolve such dispute and could have an adverse impact on the operations and profitability of the joint venture and that our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests in addition our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted in some instances we andor our partner may have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partner’s interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction our ability to acquire our partner’s interest may be limited if we do not have sufficient cash available borrowing capacity or other capital resources in such event we may be forced to sell our interest in the joint venture when we would otherwise prefer to retain it joint ventures may require us to share decisionmaking authority with our partners which could limit our ability to control the properties in the joint ventures even when we have a controlling interest certain major decisions may require partner approval such as the sale acquisition or financing of a property 

  

we are exposed to operational risks with respect to our seniors housing operating properties that could adversely affect our revenue and operations 

  

  we are exposed to various operational risks with respect to our seniors housing operating properties that may increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to generate revenues these risks include fluctuations in occupancy medicare and medicaid reimbursement if applicable and private pay rates economic conditions competition federal state local and industryregulated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards the availability and increases in cost of general and professional liability insurance coverage state regulation and rights of residents related to entrance fees and the availability and increases in the cost of labor as a result of unionization or otherwise any one or a combination of these factors may adversely affect our revenue and operations 

  

decreases in our operators’ revenues or increases in our operators’ expenses could affect our operators’ ability to make payments to us 

  

  our operators’ revenues are primarily driven by occupancy private pay rates and medicare and medicaid reimbursement if applicable expenses for these facilities are primarily driven by the costs of labor food utilities taxes insurance and rent or debt service revenues from government reimbursement have and may continue to come under pressure due to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls operating costs continue to increase for our operators to the extent that any decrease in revenues andor any increase in operating expenses result in a property not generating enough cash to make payments to us the credit of our operator and the value of other collateral would have to be relied upon to the extent the value of such property is reduced we may need to record an impairment for such asset furthermore if we determine to dispose of an underperforming property such sale may result in a loss any such impairment or loss on sale would negatively affect our financial results 

  

increased competition may affect our operators’ ability to meet their obligations to us 

  

  the operators of our properties compete on a local and regional basis with operators of properties and other health care providers that provide comparable services we cannot be certain that the operators of all of our facilities will be able to achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us our operators are expected to encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to attract residents or expand their businesses 

  

a severe cold and flu season epidemics or any other widespread illnesses could adversely affect the occupancy of our seniors housing operating and triplenet properties 

  

  our and our operators’ revenues are dependent on occupancy it is impossible to predict the severity of the cold and flu season or the occurrence of epidemics or any other widespread illnesses the occupancy of our seniors housing operating and triplenet properties could significantly decrease in the event of a severe cold and flu season an epidemic or any other widespread illness such a decrease could affect the operating income of our seniors housing operating properties and the ability of our triplenet operators to make payments to us 

  

the insolvency or bankruptcy of our obligors may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

  we are exposed to the risk that our obligors may not be able to meet the rent principal and interest or other payments due us which may result in an obligor bankruptcy or insolvency or that an obligor might become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency 

 

  

proceedings for other reasons although our operating lease agreements provide us with the right to evict a tenant demand immediate payment of rent and exercise other remedies and our loans provide us with the right to terminate any funding obligation demand immediate repayment of principal and unpaid interest foreclose on the collateral and exercise other remedies the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization an obligor in bankruptcy or subject to insolvency proceedings may be able to limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent in the case of a lease or to receive unpaid principal and interest in the case of a loan and to exercise other rights and remedies we may be required to fund certain expenses eg real estate taxes and maintenance to preserve the value of an investment property avoid the imposition of liens on a property andor transition a property to a new tenant in some instances we have terminated our lease with a tenant and relet the property to another tenant in some of those situations we have provided working capital loans to and limited indemnification of the new obligor if we cannot transition a leased property to a new tenant we may take possession of that property which may expose us to certain successor liabilities should such events occur our revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely affected 

  

we may not be able to timely reinvest our sale proceeds on terms acceptable to us 

  

  from time to time we will have cash available from 1 the proceeds of sales of our securities 2 principal payments on our loans receivable and 3 the sale of properties including nonelective dispositions under the terms of master leases or similar financial support arrangements in order to maintain current revenues and continue generating attractive returns we expect to reinvest these proceeds in a timely manner we compete for real estate investments with a broad variety of potential investors this competition for attractive investments may negatively affect our ability to make timely investments on terms acceptable to us 

  

failure to properly manage our rapid growth could distract our management or increase our expenses 

  

  we have experienced rapid growth and development in a relatively short period of time and expect to continue this rapid growth in the future this growth has resulted in increased levels of responsibility for our management future property acquisitions could place significant additional demands on and require us to expand our management resources and personnel our failure to manage any such rapid growth effectively could harm our business and in particular our financial condition results of operations and cash flows which could negatively affect our ability to make distributions to stockholders our growth could also increase our capital requirements which may require us to issue potentially dilutive equity securities and incur additional debt 

  

we depend on genesis healthcare llc “genesis” and brookdale senior living for a significant portion of our revenues and any inability or unwillingness by genesis and brookdale senior living to satisfy their obligations under their agreements with us could adversely affect us 

  

  the properties we lease to genesis and brookdale senior living account for a significant portion of our revenues and because our leases with genesis and brookdale senior living are triplenet leases we also depend on genesis and brookdale senior living to pay all insurance taxes utilities and maintenance and repair expenses in connection with the leased properties we cannot assure you that genesis and brookdale senior living will have sufficient assets income and access to financing to enable them to make rental payments to us or to otherwise satisfy their respective obligations under our leases and any inability or unwillingness by genesis or brookdale senior living to do so could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition genesis and brookdale senior living have also agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses and we cannot assure you that genesis and brookdale senior living will have sufficient assets income access to financing and insurance coverage to enable them to satisfy their respective indemnification obligations genesis and brookdale senior living’s failure to effectively conduct their operations or to maintain and improve our properties could adversely affect their business reputations and their ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties which in turn could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

the properties managed by sunrise senior living llc account for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income and any adverse developments in its business or financial condition could adversely affect us 

  

  sunrise senior living llc manages our entire sunrise property portfolio which as of december 31 2016 consisted of 157 seniors housing properties these properties account for a significant portion of our revenues and we rely on sunrise senior living llc to manage these properties efficiently and effectively we also rely on sunrise senior living llc to set appropriate resident fees to provide accurate propertylevel financial results for our properties in a timely manner and to otherwise operate them in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations any adverse developments in sunrise senior living llc’s business or financial condition could impair its ability to manage our properties efficiently and effectively which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition also if sunrise senior living llc experiences any significant financial legal accounting or regulatory difficulties such difficulties could result in among other things acceleration of its indebtedness impairment of its continued access to capital or the commencement of insolvency proceedings by or against it under the us bankruptcy code which in turn could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

  

  

ownership of property outside the united states may subject us to different or greater risks than those associated with our domestic operations 

  

  we have operations in canada and the united kingdom international development ownership and operating activities involve risks that are different from those we face with respect to our domestic properties and operations these risks include but are not limited to any international currency gain recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates may not qualify under the 75 gross income test or the 95 gross income test that we must satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a reit challenges with respect to the repatriation of foreign earnings and cash changes in foreign political regulatory and economic conditions including regionally nationally and locally including but not limited to the united kingdom’s june 2016 vote to exit the european union commonly known as “brexit” challenges in managing international operations challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations including those relating to real estate corporate governance operations taxes employment and other civil and criminal legal proceedings foreign ownership restrictions with respect to operations in countries differences in lending practices and the willingness of domestic or foreign lenders to provide financing regional or countryspecific business cycles and political and economic instability and failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations in the united states that affect foreign operations including but not limited to the us foreign corrupt practices act if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with international expansion and operations our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

  

we do not know if our tenants will renew their existing leases and if they do not we may be unable to lease the properties on as favorable terms or at all 

  

  we cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases at the end of their lease terms which expire at various times if these leases are not renewed we would be required to find other tenants to occupy those properties or sell them there can be no assurance that we would be able to identify suitable replacement tenants or enter into leases with new tenants on terms as favorable to us as the current leases or that we would be able to lease those properties at all 

  

our operators and managers may not have the necessary insurance coverage to insure adequately against losses 

  

  we maintain or require our operators and managers to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties and their operations with terms conditions limits and deductibles that we believe are customary for similarlysituated companies in our industry and we continually review our insurance programs and requirements that said we cannot assure you that we or our operators or managers will continue to be able to maintain adequate levels of insurance and required coverages which could adversely affect us in the event of a significant uninsured loss also in recent years longtermpostacute care and seniors housing operators and managers have experienced substantial increases in both the number and size of patient care liability claims as a result general and professional liability costs have increased in some markets general and professional liability insurance coverage may be restricted or very costly which may adversely affect the property operators’ and managers’ future operations cash flows and financial condition and may have a material adverse effect on the property operators’ and managers’ ability to meet their obligations to us 

  

our ownership of properties through ground leases exposes us to the loss of such properties upon breach or termination of the ground leases 

  

  we have acquired an interest in certain of our properties by acquiring a leasehold interest in the property on which the building is located and we may acquire additional properties in the future through the purchase of interests in ground leases as the lessee under a ground lease we are exposed to the possibility of losing the property upon termination of the ground lease or an earlier breach of the ground lease by us 

  

the requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid could have a material adverse effect on our obligors’ liquidity financial condition and results of operations which could adversely affect our obligors’ ability to meet their obligations to us 

  

  some of our obligors’ businesses are affected by government reimbursement to the extent that an operatortenant receives a significant portion of its revenues from government payors primarily medicare and medicaid such revenues may be subject to statutory and regulatory changes retroactive rate adjustments recovery of program overpayments or setoffs court decisions administrative rulings policy interpretations payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers government funding restrictions at a program level or with respect to specific facilities and interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing government investigations and audits at such property in recent years government payors have frozen or reduced payments to health care providers due to budgetary pressures health care reimbursement will likely continue to be of paramount importance to federal and state authorities we cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or effect any future legislative reforms may have on the financial condition of our obligors and properties there can be no assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will be available 

 

  

for services provided by any property operator whether the property receives reimbursement from medicare medicaid or private payors significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on an obligor’s liquidity financial condition and results of operations which could adversely affect the ability of an obligor to meet its obligations to us 

  

  the patient protection and affordable care act as modified by the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the “health reform laws” provides those states that expand their medicaid coverage to otherwise eligible state residents with incomes at or below 138 of the federal poverty level with an increased federal medical assistance percentage effective january 1 2014 when certain conditions are met given that the federal government substantially funds the medicaid expansion it is unclear how many states will ultimately pursue this option although as of early february 2017 more than half of the states have expanded medicaid coverage the participation by states in the medicaid expansion could have the dual effect of increasing our tenants’ revenues through new patients but further straining state budgets and their ability to pay our tenants we expect that the new presidential administration and us congress will seek to modify repeal or otherwise invalidate all or certain provisions of the health reform laws including medicaid expansion since taking office president trump has continued to support the repeal of all or portions of the health reform laws the house and senate have recently passed a budget resolution that authorizes congressional committees to draft legislation to repeal all or portions of the health reform laws and permits such legislation to pass with a majority vote in the senate president trump has also recently issued an executive order in which he stated that it is his administration’s policy to seek the prompt repeal of the health reform laws and directed executive departments and federal agencies to waive defer grant exemptions from or delay the implementation of the provisions of health reform laws to the maximum extent permitted by law there is still uncertainty with respect to the impact president trump’s administration and the us congress may have if any and any changes will likely take time to unfold and could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for health care items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the health reform laws we cannot predict whether the existing health reform laws or future health care reform legislation or regulatory changes will have a material impact on our operators’ or tenants’ property or business if the operations cash flows or financial condition of our operators and tenants are materially adversely impacted by the health reform laws or future legislation our revenue and operations may be adversely affected as well see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — united states — reimbursement” above 

  

  more generally and because of the dynamic nature of the legislative and regulatory environment for health care products and services and in light of existing federal deficit and budgetary concerns we cannot predict the impact that broadbased farreaching legislative or regulatory changes could have on the us economy our business or that of our operators and tenants 

  

our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with federal state local and industryregulated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards could adversely affect such operators’ or tenants’ operations which could adversely affect our operators’ and tenants’ ability to meet their obligations to us 

  

  our operators and tenants generally are subject to varying levels of federal state local and industryregulated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with any of these laws regulations or standards could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension decertification or exclusion from federal and state health care programs loss of license or closure of the facility such actions may have an effect on our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make lease payments to us and therefore adversely impact us see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — united states — fraud  abuse enforcement” above 

  

  many of our properties may require a license registration andor certificate of need “con” to operate failure to obtain a license registration or con or loss of a required license registration or con would prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by the operators or tenants these events could materially adversely affect our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make rent payments to us state and local laws also may regulate the expansion including the addition of new beds or services or acquisition of medical equipment and the construction or renovation of health care facilities by requiring a con or other similar approval from a state agency see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — united states — licensing and certification” above 

  

illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties 

  

  real estate investments are relatively illiquid our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in economic and other conditions will be limited no assurances can be given that we will recognize full value for any property that we are required to sell for liquidity reasons our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition we are exposed to the risks inherent in concentrating investments in real estate and in particular the seniors housing and health care industries a downturn in the real estate industry could adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to sell properties for a price or on terms acceptable to us 

  

 

  

unfavorable resolution of pending and future litigation matters and disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

  

  from time to time we may be directly involved in a number of legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims we may also be named as defendants in lawsuits allegedly arising out of our actions or the actions of our operatorstenants or managers in which such operatorstenants or managers have agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses an unfavorable resolution of pending or future litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition regardless of its outcome litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of management there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail in or achieve a favorable settlement of pending or future litigation in addition pending litigation or future litigation government proceedings or environmental matters could lead to increased costs or interruption of our normal business operations 

  

development redevelopment and construction risks could affect our profitability 

  

  at any given time we may be in the process of constructing one or more new facilities that ultimately will require a con and license before they can be utilized by the operator for their intended use the operator also may need to obtain medicare and medicaid certification and enter into medicare and medicaid provider agreements andor third party payor contracts in the event that the operator is unable to obtain the necessary con licensure certification provider agreements or contracts after the completion of construction there is a risk that we will not be able to earn any revenues on the facility until either the initial operator obtains a license or certification to operate the new facility and the necessary provider agreements or contracts or we find and contract with a new operator that is able to obtain a license to operate the facility for its intended use and the necessary provider agreements or contracts 

  

  in connection with our renovation redevelopment development and related construction activities we may be unable to obtain or suffer delays in obtaining necessary zoning landuse building occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations these factors could result in increased costs or our abandonment of these projects in addition we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms which may render us unable to proceed with our development activities and we may not be able to complete construction and leaseup of a property on schedule which could result in increased debt service expense or construction costs additionally the time frame required for development construction and leaseup of these properties means that we may have to wait years for significant cash returns because we are required to make cash distributions to our stockholders if the cash flow from operations or refinancing is not sufficient we may be forced to borrow additional money to fund such distributions newly developed and acquired properties may not produce the cash flow that we expect which could adversely affect our overall financial performance 

  

  in deciding whether to acquire or develop a particular property we make assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property in particular we estimate the return on our investment based on expected occupancy rental rates and capital costs if our financial projections with respect to a new property are inaccurate as a result of increases in capital costs or other factors the property may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment our estimate of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove to be inaccurate which may result in our failure to meet our profitability goals additionally we may acquire new properties that are not fully leased and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with that property 

  

we may experience losses caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters which could result in an increase of our or our tenants’ cost of insurance a decrease in our anticipated revenues or a significant loss of the capital we have invested in a property 

  

  we maintain or require our tenants to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties with terms conditions limits and deductibles that we believe are appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage and we continually review our insurance programs and requirements however a large number of our properties are located in areas particularly susceptible to revenue loss cost increase or damage caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters such as hurricanes earthquakes tornadoes and floods we believe given current industry practice and analysis prepared by outside consultants that our and our tenants’ insurance coverage is appropriate to cover reasonably anticipated losses that may be caused by hurricanes earthquakes tornadoes floods and other severe weather conditions and natural disasters nevertheless we are always subject to the risk that such insurance will not fully cover all losses and depending on the severity of the event and the impact on our properties such insurance may not cover a significant portion of the losses these losses may lead to an increase of our and our tenants’ cost of insurance a decrease in our anticipated revenues from an affected property and a loss of all or a portion of the capital we have invested in an affected property in addition we or our tenants may not purchase insurance under certain circumstances if the cost of insurance exceeds in our or our tenants’ judgment the value of the coverage relative to the risk of loss 

  

we may incur costs to remediate environmental contamination at our properties which could have an adverse effect on our or our obligors’ business or financial condition 

  

 

  

  under various federal and state laws owners or operators of real estate may be required to respond to the presence or release of hazardous substances on the property and may be held liable for property damage personal injuries or penalties that result from environmental contamination or exposure to hazardous substances we may become liable to reimburse the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination generally such liability attaches to a person based on the person’s relationship to the property our tenants or borrowers are primarily responsible for the condition of the property moreover we review environmental site assessments of the properties that we own or encumber prior to taking an interest in them those assessments are designed to meet the “all appropriate inquiry” standard which we believe qualifies us for the innocent purchaser defense if environmental liabilities arise based upon such assessments we do not believe that any of our properties are subject to material environmental contamination however environmental liabilities may be present in our properties and we may incur costs to remediate contamination which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition or the business or financial condition of our obligors 

  

cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our business and result in the loss of confidential information 

  

  our business is at risk from and may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential data and other electronic security breaches such cyber attacks can range from individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems to more sophisticated security threats while we employ a number of measures to prevent detect and mitigate these threats there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a cyber attack cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our business and compromise the confidential information of our employees operators and tenants 

  

actual or threatened terrorist attacks could adversely affect the occupancy and the value of our properties 

  

  we have significant investments in large metropolitan markets that have been or may be in the future the targets of actual or threatened terrorism attacks including boston chicago new york san diego san francisco los angeles and washington dc as a result some of our tenants in these markets may choose to relocate to other markets that may be perceived to be less likely targets of future terrorist activity this could result in an overall decrease in the occupancy of our properties in addition terrorist attacks could also result in significant damages to or loss of our properties which could exceed our insurance coverage 

  

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain antitakeover provisions 

  

  our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain antitakeover provisions restrictions on share ownership and transfer and super majority stockholder approval requirements for business combinations that could make it more difficult for or even prevent a third party from acquiring us without the approval of our incumbent board of directors provisions and agreements that inhibit or discourage takeover attempts could reduce the market value of our common stock 

  

our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed 

  

  we are dependent on key personnel although we have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers losing any one of them could at least temporarily have an adverse impact on our operations we believe that losing more than one could have a material adverse impact on our business 

  

risks arising from our capital structure 

  

we may become more leveraged 

  

  permanent financing for our investments is typically provided through a combination of public offerings of debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt the incurrence or assumption of indebtedness may cause us to become more leveraged which could 1 require us to dedicate a greater portion of our cash flow to the payment of debt service 2 make us more vulnerable to a downturn in the economy 3 limit our ability to obtain additional financing or 4 negatively affect our credit ratings or outlook by one or more of the rating agencies 

  

we are subject to covenants in our debt agreements that may restrict or limit our operations and acquisitions and our failure to comply with the covenants in our debt agreements could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

  our debt agreements contain various covenants restrictions and events of default among other things these provisions require us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness create liens and make investments or acquisitions breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the 

 

  

applicable indebtedness in addition to any other indebtedness crossdefaulted against such instruments these defaults could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to make future investments or to meet our obligations and commitments 

  

  we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the capital necessary to make future investments or to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature our access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control including rising interest rates inflation and other general market conditions the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions the market price of the shares of our capital stock and the credit ratings of our debt securities the financial stability of our lenders which might impair their ability to meet their commitments to us or their willingness to make additional loans to us changes in the credit ratings on us government debt securities or default or delay in payment by the united states of its obligations if our access to capital is limited by these factors or other factors it could negatively impact our ability to acquire properties repay or refinance our indebtedness fund operations or make distributions to our stockholders 

  

downgrades in our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital 

  

  we plan to manage the company to maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile but there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity andor financial condition 

  

fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

  

  as we expand our operations internationally currency exchange rate fluctuations could affect our results of operations and financial position we expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenue and expenses in such foreign currencies as the canadian dollar and the british pound although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions andor obtain local currency mortgage debt in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies we cannot assure you that foreign currency fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on us 

  

our entry into swap agreements may not effectively reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates 

  

  we enter into swap agreements from time to time to manage some of our exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate volatility these swap agreements involve risks such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements in addition these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates when we use forwardstarting interest rate swaps there is a risk that we will not complete the longterm borrowing against which the swap is intended to hedge if such events occur our results of operations may be adversely affected 

  

risks arising from our status as a reit 

  

we might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

  

  we intend to operate as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” and believe we have and will continue to operate in such a manner if we lose our status as a reit we will face serious income tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for satisfying our obligations and for distribution to our stockholders because 

•   we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rates 

•   we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes and 

•   unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions we could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified 

  

  since reit qualification requires us to meet a number of complex requirements it is possible that we may fail to fulfill them and if we do our earnings will be reduced by the amount of us federal and other income taxes owed a reduction in our earnings would affect the amount we could distribute to our stockholders if we do not qualify as a reit we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders since a nonreit is not required to pay dividends to stockholders in order to maintain reit status or avoid an excise tax see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations” above for a discussion of the provisions of the code that apply to us and the effects of failure to qualify as a reit in addition if we fail to qualify as a reit all distributions to stockholders would continue to be treated as dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and 

 

  

profits although corporate stockholders may be eligible for the dividends received deduction and individual stockholders may be eligible for taxation at the rates generally applicable to longterm capital gains currently at a maximum rate of 20 with respect to distributions 

  

  as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to implement our business strategy and would adversely affect the value of our common stock qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to remain qualified as a reit although we believe that we qualify as a reit we cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify or remain qualified as a reit for us federal income tax purposes see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations” above 

  

certain subsidiaries might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

  

  we own interests in a number of entities which have elected to be taxed as reits for federal income tax purposes some of which we consolidate for financial reporting purposes but each of which is treated as a separate reit for federal income tax purposes each a “subsidiary reit” to qualify as a reit each subsidiary reit must independently satisfy all of the reit qualification requirements under the code together with all other rules applicable to reits provided that each subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit our interests in the subsidiary reits will be treated as qualifying real estate assets for purposes of the reit asset tests see “item 1 – business – taxation – federal income tax considerations – qualification as a reit – asset tests” above if a subsidiary reit fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year such subsidiary reit will be subject to federal and state income taxes and may not be able to qualify as a reit for the four subsequent taxable years any such failure could have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reit income and asset tests and thus our ability to qualify as a reit unless we are able to avail ourselves of certain relief provisions 

  

the 90 annual distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions 

  

  to comply with the 90 distribution requirement applicable to reits and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax we must make distributions to our stockholders see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations — qualification as a reit — annual distribution requirements” above although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the reit distribution requirement it is possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90 distribution requirement or we may decide to retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation this may be due to timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses on the one hand and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income on the other hand in addition nondeductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of noncash deductions may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90 distribution requirement in the event that timing differences occur or we deem it appropriate to retain cash we may borrow funds issue additional equity securities although we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so pay taxable stock dividends if possible distribute other property or securities or engage in another transaction intended to enable us to meet the reit distribution requirements this may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations 

  

the lease of qualified health care properties to a taxable reit subsidiary is subject to special requirements 

  

  we lease certain qualified health care properties to taxable reit subsidiaries or limited liability companies of which the taxable reit subsidiaries are members which lessees contract with managers or related parties to manage the health care operations at these properties the rents from this taxable reit subsidiary lessee structure are treated as qualifying rents from real property if 1 they are paid pursuant to an armslength lease of a qualified health care property with a taxable reit subsidiary and 2 the manager qualifies as an eligible independent contractor as defined in the code if any of these conditions are not satisfied then the rents will not be qualifying rents see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations — qualification as a reit — income tests” above 

  

if certain saleleaseback transactions are not characterized by the internal revenue service as “true leases” we may be subject to adverse tax consequences 

  

  we have purchased certain properties and leased them back to the sellers of such properties and we may enter into similar transactions in the future we intend for any such saleleaseback transaction to be structured in such a manner that the lease will be characterized as a “true lease” thereby allowing us to be treated as the owner of the property for us federal income tax purposes however depending on the terms of any specific transaction the internal revenue service might take the position that the transaction is not a “true lease” but is more properly treated in some other manner in the event any saleleaseback transaction is challenged and successfully recharacterized by the internal revenue service we would not be entitled to claim the deductions for depreciation and 

 

  

cost recovery generally available to an owner of property furthermore if a saleleaseback transaction were so recharacterized we might fail to satisfy the reit asset tests or income tests and consequently could lose our reit status effective with the year of recharacterization see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations — qualification as a reit — asset tests” and “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations — qualification as a reit — income tests” above alternatively the amount of our reit taxable income could be recalculated which may cause us to fail to meet the reit annual distribution requirements for a taxable year see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations — qualification as a reit — annual distribution requirements” above 

  

the new presidential administration may propose substantial changes to fiscal and tax policies that if enacted may adversely affect reits and our business 

  

  the recently inaugurated us president and his administration have called for substantial changes to fiscal and tax policies which may include comprehensive tax reform we cannot predict the impact if any of such tax reform to reits or to our business it is possible that any comprehensive tax reform could adversely affect reits in general or our business specifically until any such tax reform changes are enacted we will not know whether we will benefit from or will be negatively affected by such changes

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

  from time to time there are various legal proceedings pending against us that arise in the ordinary course of our business management does not believe that the resolution of any of these legal proceedings either individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition despite management’s view of the ultimate resolution of these legal proceedings we may have significant legal expenses and costs associated with the defense of such matters further management cannot predict the outcome of these legal proceedings and if management’s expectation regarding such matters is not correct such proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

  from time to time we are party to certain legal proceedings for which third parties such as tenants operators andor managers are contractually obligated to indemnify defend and hold us harmless in some of these matters the indemnitors have insurance for the potential damages in other matters we are being defended by tenants and other obligated third parties and these indemnitors may not have sufficient insurance assets income or resources to satisfy their defense and indemnification obligations to us the unfavorable resolution of such legal proceedings could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect the indemnitors’ ability to satisfy their respective obligations to us which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition it is management’s opinion that there are currently no such legal proceedings pending that will individually or in the aggregate have such a material adverse effect

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  we are exposed to various market risks including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we seek to mitigate the underlying foreign currency exposures with gains and losses on derivative contracts hedging these exposures we seek to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates by matching the terms of new investments with new longterm fixed rate borrowings to the extent possible we may or may not elect to use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate exposure these decisions are principally based on our policy to match our variable rate investments with comparable borrowings but are also based on the general trend in interest rates at the applicable dates and our perception of the future volatility of interest rates this section is a discussion of the risks associated with potential fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates for additional information see “item 7 — management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — critical accounting policies” and notes 11 and 16 to our consolidated financial statements 

  we historically borrow on our primary unsecured credit facility to acquire construct or make loans relating to health care and seniors housing properties then as market conditions dictate we will issue equity or longterm fixed rate debt to repay the borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility we are subject to risks associated with debt financing including the risk that existing indebtedness may not be refinanced or that the terms of refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of current indebtedness the majority of our borrowings were completed under indentures or contractual agreements that limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur accordingly in the event that we are unable to raise additional equity or borrow money because of these limitations our ability to acquire additional properties may be limited 

  a change in interest rates will not affect the interest expense associated with our fixed rate debt interest rate changes however will affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt changes in the interest rate environment upon maturity of this fixed rate debt could have an effect on our future cash flows and earnings depending on whether the debt is replaced with other fixed rate debt variable rate debt or equity or repaid by the sale of assets to illustrate the impact of changes in the interest rate markets we performed a sensitivity analysis on our fixed rate debt instruments whereby we modeled the change in net present values arising from a hypothetical 1 increase in interest rates to determine the instruments’ change in fair value the following table summarizes the analysis performed as of the dates indicated in thousands 

  



  our variable rate debt including our primary unsecured credit facility is reflected at fair value at december 31 2016 we had 2311996000 outstanding related to our variable rate debt assuming no changes in outstanding balances a 1 increase in interest rates would result in increased annual interest expense of 23120000 at december 31 2015 we had 2236733000 outstanding under our variable rate debt assuming no changes in outstanding balances a 1 increase in interest rates would have resulted in increased annual interest expense of 22367000 

  we are subject to currency fluctuations that may from time to time affect our financial condition and results of operations increases or decreases in the value of the canadian dollar or pounds sterling relative to the us dollar impact the amount of net income we earn from our investments in canada and the united kingdom based solely on our results for the year ended december 31 2016 including the impact of existing hedging arrangements if these exchange rates were to increase or decrease by 10 our net income from these investments would increase or decrease as applicable by less than 2000000 we will continue to mitigate these underlying foreign currency exposures with nonus denominated borrowings and gains and losses on derivative contracts if we increase our international presence through investments in or acquisitions or development of seniors housing and health care properties outside the us we may also decide to transact additional business or borrow funds in currencies other than us dollars canadian dollars or pounds sterling to illustrate the impact of changes in foreign currency markets we performed a sensitivity analysis on our derivative portfolio whereby we modeled the change in net present values arising from a hypothetical 1 increase in foreign currency exchange rates to determine the instruments’ change in fair value the following table summarizes the results of the analysis performed excluding cross currency hedge activity dollars in thousands

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

management has assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016 based on the criteria established by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 2013 framework in a report entitled internal control — integrated framework 

  

the scope of management’s assessment as of december 31 2016 did not include an assessment of the internal control over financial reporting for certain acquisitions because the business combinations occurred during the year ended december 31 2016 the acquired businesses represent 4 of total assets at december 31 2016 and less than 1 of revenues and net operating income for the year then ended the scope of management’s assessment on internal control over financial reporting for the year ended december 31 2017 will include the aforementioned acquired operations 

  

based on this assessment using the criteria above management concluded that the company’s system of internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2016

depending upon market conditions we believe that new investments will be available in the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to our stockholders we invest in seniors housing and health care real estate primarily through acquisitions developments and joint venture partnerships for additional information regarding acquisition and development activity please see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements we diversify our investment portfolio by property type relationship and geographic location in determining whether to invest in a property we focus on the following 1 the experience of the obligor’spartner’s management team 2 the historical and projected financial and operational performance of the property 3 the credit of the obligorpartner 4 the security for any lease or loan 5 the real estate attributes of the building and its location 6 the capital committed to the property by the obligorpartner and 7 the operating fundamentals of the applicable industry we conduct market research and analysis for all potential investments in addition we review the value of all properties the interest rates and covenant requirements of any facilitylevel debt to be assumed at the time of the acquisition and the anticipated sources of repayment of any existing debt that is not to be assumed at the time of the acquisition 

  

we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property our proactive and comprehensive asset management process for seniors housing properties generally includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each property review of obligorpartner creditworthiness property inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure real estate taxes letters of credit and other collateral our internal property management division actively manages and monitors the outpatient medical portfolio with a comprehensive process including review of among other things tenant relations lease expirations the mix of health service providers hospitalhealth system relationships property performance capital improvement needs and market conditions in monitoring our portfolio our personnel use a proprietary database to collect and analyze propertyspecific data additionally we conduct extensive research to ascertain industry trends 

  

we evaluate the operating environment in each property’s market to determine the likely trend in operating performance of the facility when we identify unacceptable trends we seek to mitigate eliminate or transfer the risk through these efforts we are generally able to intervene at an early stage to address any negative trends and in so doing support both the collectability of revenue and the value of our investment 

  

investment types 

  

real property our properties are primarily comprised of land buildings improvements and related rights our triplenet properties are generally leased to operators under longterm operating leases the leases generally have a fixed contractual term of 12 to 15 years and contain one or more five to 15year renewal options certain of our leases also contain purchase options a portion of which could result in the disposition of properties for less than full market value most of our rents are received under triplenet leases requiring the operator to pay rent and all additional charges incurred in the operation of the leased property the tenants are required to repair rebuild and maintain the leased properties substantially all of these operating leases are designed with escalating rent structures leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straightline basis over the initial lease period subject to a collectability assessment rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period 

  

at december 31 2015 approximately 92 of our triplenet properties were subject to master leases a master lease is a lease of multiple properties to one tenant entity under a single lease agreement from time to time we may acquire additional properties that are then leased to the tenant under the master lease the tenant is required to make one monthly payment that represents rent on all the properties that are subject to the master lease typically the master lease tenant can exercise its right to purchase the properties or to renew the master lease only with respect to all leased properties at the same time this bundling feature benefits us because the tenant 

  

cannot limit the purchase or renewal to the better performing properties and terminate the leasing arrangement with respect to the poorer performing properties this spreads our risk among the entire group of properties within the master lease the bundling feature should provide a similar advantage to us if the master lease tenant is in bankruptcy subject to certain restrictions a debtor in bankruptcy has the right to assume or reject each of its leases it is our intent that a tenant in bankruptcy would be required to assume or reject the master lease as a whole rather than deciding on a property by property basis 

  

our outpatient medical portfolio is primarily selfmanaged and consists principally of multitenant properties leased to health care providers our leases typically include increasers and some form of operating expense reimbursement by the tenant as of december 31 2015 82 of our portfolio included leases with full pass through 15 with a partial expense reimbursement modified gross and 3 with no expense reimbursement gross our outpatient medical leases are noncancellable operating leases that have a weightedaverage remaining term of seven years at december 31 2015 and are often credit enhanced by security deposits guaranties andor letters of credit 

  

construction we occasionally provide for the construction of properties for tenants as part of longterm operating leases we capitalize certain interest costs associated with funds used for the construction of properties owned by us the amount capitalized is based upon the amount advanced during the construction period using the rate of interest that approximates our companywide cost of financing our interest expense is reduced by the amount capitalized we also typically charge a transaction fee at the commencement of construction which we defer and amortize to income over the term of the resulting lease the construction period commences upon funding and terminates upon the earlier of the completion of the applicable property or the end of a specified period during the construction period we advance funds to the tenants in accordance with agreed upon terms and conditions which require among other things periodic site visits by a company representative during the construction period we generally require an additional credit enhancement in the form of payment and performance bonds andor completion guaranties at december 31 2015 we had outstanding construction investments of 258968000 and were committed to provide additional funds of approximately 525588000 to complete construction for investment properties 

  

real estate loans our real estate loans are typically structured to provide us with interest income principal amortization and transaction fees and are generally secured by firstsecond mortgage liens leasehold mortgages corporate guaranties andor personal guaranties at december 31 2015 we had outstanding real estate loans of 819492000 the interest yield averaged approximately 81 per annum on our outstanding real estate loan balances our yield on real estate loans depends upon a number of factors including the stated interest rate average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments the real estate loans outstanding at december 31 2015 are generally subject to one to 15year terms with principal amortization schedules andor balloon payments of the outstanding principal balances at the end of the term typically real estate loans are crossdefaulted and crosscollateralized with other real estate loans operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its affiliates 

  

  investments in unconsolidated entities  investments in entities that we do not consolidate but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are reported under the equity method of accounting our investments in unconsolidated entities generally represent interests ranging from 10 to 50 in real estate assets under the equity method of accounting our share of the investee’s earnings or losses is included in our consolidated results of operations to the extent that our cost basis is different from the basis reflected at the entity level the basis difference is generally amortized over the lives of the related assets and liabilities and such amortization is included in our share of equity in earnings of the entity the initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated entities is based on the amount paid to purchase the entity interest or the estimated fair value of the assets prior to the sale of interests in the entity we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the equity method investment to its carrying value when we determine a decline in the estimated fair value of such an investment below its carrying value is otherthantemporary an impairment is recorded see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for more information 

  

principles of consolidation 

  

the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our whollyowned subsidiaries and joint venture entities that we control through voting rights or other means all material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation 

  

at inception of joint venture transactions we identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights “variable interest entities” or “vies” and determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of its operations a vie is broadly defined as an entity where either i the equity investors as a group if any do not have a controlling financial interest or ii the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support we consolidate investments in vies when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary accounting standards codification topic 810 consolidations  requires enterprises to perform a qualitative approach to determining whether or not a vie will need to be consolidated on a continuous basis this evaluation is based on an enterprise’s ability to direct and influence the activities of a vie that most significantly impact that entity’s economic performance 

  

  

for investments in joint ventures we evaluate the type of rights held by the limited partners which may preclude consolidation in circumstances in which the sole general partner would otherwise consolidate the limited partnership the assessment of limited partners’ rights and their impact on the presumption of control over a limited partnership by the sole general partner should be made when an investor becomes the sole general partner and should be reassessed if i there is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights of the limited partners ii the sole general partner increases or decreases its ownership in the limited partnership or iii there is an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding limited partnership interests we similarly evaluate the rights of managing members of limited liability companies 

  

borrowing policies 

  

we utilize a combination of debt and equity to fund investments our debt and equity levels are determined by management to maintain a conservative credit profile generally we intend to issue unsecured fixedrate public debt with longterm maturities to approximate the maturities on our triplenet leases and loans for shortterm purposes we may borrow on our primary unsecured credit facility we replace these borrowings with longterm capital such as senior unsecured notes common stock or preferred stock when terms are deemed favorable we may invest in properties subject to existing mortgage indebtedness in addition we may obtain secured financing for unleveraged properties in which we have invested or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis in certain agreements with our lenders we are subject to restrictions with respect to secured and unsecured indebtedness 

  

competition 

  

we compete with other real estate investment trusts real estate partnerships private equity and hedge fund investors banks insurance companies financeinvestment companies governmentsponsored agencies taxable and taxexempt bond funds health care operators developers and other investors in the acquisition development leasing and financing of health care and seniors housing properties we compete for investments based on a number of factors including relationships certainty of execution investment structures and underwriting criteria our ability to successfully compete is impacted by economic and demographic trends availability of acceptable investment opportunities our ability to negotiate beneficial investment terms availability and cost of capital construction and renovation costs and applicable laws and regulations 

  

the operatorstenants of our properties compete with properties that provide comparable services in the local markets operatorstenants compete for patients and residents based on a number of factors including quality of care reputation physical appearance of properties location services offered family preferences physicians staff and price we also face competition from other health care facilities for tenants such as physicians and other health care providers that provide comparable facilities and services

health care industry 

  

the demand for health care services and consequently health care properties is projected to reach unprecedented levels in the near future the centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” projects that national health expenditures will rise to approximately 34 trillion in 2016 or 181 of gross domestic product “gdp” the average annual growth in national health expenditures for 2014 through 2024 is expected to be 58 

  

  while demographics are the primary driver of demand economic conditions and availability of services contribute to health care service utilization rates we believe the health care property market may be less susceptible to fluctuations and economic downturns relative to other property sectors investor interest in the market remains strong especially in specific sectors such as privatepay senior living and outpatient medical buildings 

  

  the total us population for 2014 through 2024 is projected to increase by 91 the elderly population aged 65 and over is projected to increase by 40 through 2024 the elderly are an important component of health care utilization especially independent living services assisted living services longtermpostacute care services inpatient and outpatient hospital services and physician ambulatory care most health care services are provided within a health care facility such as a hospital a physician’s office or a seniors housing community therefore we believe there will be continued demand for companies such as ours with expertise in health care real estate 

  

  

health care real estate investment opportunities tend to increase as demand for health care services increases we recognize the need for health care real estate as it correlates to health care service demand health care providers require real estate to house their businesses and expand their services we believe that investment opportunities in health care real estate will continue to be present due to 

·   the specialized nature of the industry which enhances the credibility and experience of the company 

·   the projected population growth combined with stable or increasing health care utilization rates which ensures demand and 

·   the ongoing merger and acquisition activity 

  

certain government regulations 

  

united states 

  

health law matters — generally 

  

  typically operators of seniors housing facilities do not receive significant funding from government programs and are largely subject to state laws as opposed to federal laws operators of longtermpostacute care facilities and hospitals do receive significant funding from government programs and these facilities are subject to the federal and state laws that regulate the type and quality of the medical andor nursing care provided ancillary services  eg  respiratory occupational physical and infusion therapies qualifications of the administrative personnel and nursing staff the adequacy of the physical plant and equipment reimbursement and rate setting and operating policies in addition as described below operators of these facilities are subject to extensive laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including but not limited to the federal antikickback statute the federal stark law and the federal false claims act as well as comparable state law counterparts hospitals physician group practice clinics and other health care providers that operate in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal state and local licensure registration certification and inspection laws regulations and industry standards our tenants’ failure to comply with any of these and other laws could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension decertification or exclusion from federal and state health care programs loss of license or closure of the facility 

  

licensing and certification 

  

  the primary regulations that affect seniors housing facilities with assisted living are state licensing and registration laws in granting and renewing these licenses the state regulatory agencies consider numerous factors relating to a property’s physical plant and operations including but not limited to admission and discharge standards staffing and training a decision to grant or renew a license is also affected by a property owner’s record with respect to patient and consumer rights medication guidelines and rules certain of the seniors housing facilities mortgaged to or owned by us may require the resident to pay an entrance or upfront fee a portion of which may be refundable these entrance fee communities are subject to significant state regulatory oversight including for example oversight of each facility’s financial condition establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial restrictions the right of residents to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time lien rights in favor of residents restrictions on change of ownership and similar matters such oversight and the rights of residents within these entrance fee communities may have an effect on the revenue or operations of the facility operators and therefore may adversely affect us 

  

  certain health care facilities are subject to a variety of licensure and certificate of need “con” laws and regulations where applicable con laws generally require among other requirements that a facility demonstrate the need for 1 constructing a new facility 2 adding beds or expanding an existing facility 3 investing in major capital equipment or adding new services 4 changing the ownership or control of an existing licensed facility or 5 terminating services that have been previously approved through the con process certain state con laws and regulations may restrict the ability of operators to add new properties or expand an existing facility’s size or services in addition con laws may constrain the ability of an operator to transfer responsibility for operating a particular facility to a new operator if we have to replace a property operator who is excluded from participating in a federal or state health care program as discussed below our ability to replace the operator may be affected by a particular state’s con laws regulations and applicable guidance governing changes in provider control 

  

  with respect to licensure generally our longtermpostacute care facilities and acute care facilities are required to be licensed and certified for participation in medicare medicaid and other federal and state health care programs this generally requires license renewals and compliance surveys on an annual or biannual basis the failure of our operators to maintain or renew any required license or regulatory approval as well as the failure of our operators to correct serious deficiencies identified in a compliance survey could require those operators to discontinue operations at a property in addition if a property is found to be out of compliance with medicare medicaid or other federal or state health care program conditions of participation the property operator may be excluded from participating in those government health care programs any such occurrence may impair an operator’s ability to meet their financial obligations to us if we have to replace an excludedproperty operator our ability to replace the operator may be affected by 

  

federal and state laws regulations and applicable guidance governing changes in provider control this may result in payment delays an inability to find a replacement operator a significant working capital commitment from us to a new operator or other difficulties 

  

reimbursement 

  

  the reimbursement methodologies applied to health care facilities continue to evolve federal and state authorities have considered and may seek to implement new or modified reimbursement methodologies that may negatively impact health care property operations the impact of any such changes if implemented may result in a material adverse effect on our portfolio no assurance can be given that current revenue sources or levels will be maintained accordingly there can be no assurance that payments under a government health care program are currently or will be in the future sufficient to fully reimburse the property operators for their operating and capital expenses as a result an operator’s ability to meet its financial obligations to us could be adversely impacted 

  

  seniors housing facilities excluding longtermpostacute care facilities approximately 54 of our overall revenues for the year ended december 31 2015 were attributable to us seniors housing facilities the majority of the revenues received by the operators of these facilities are from private pay sources the remaining revenue source is primarily medicaid under certain waiver programs as a part of the omnibus budget reconciliation act “obra” of 1981 congress established a waiver program enabling some states to offer medicaid reimbursement to assisted living providers as an alternative to institutional longterm care services the provisions of obra the subsequent obra acts of 1987 and 1990 and certain provisions of the patient protection and affordable care act of 2010 “ppaca” permit states to seek a waiver from typical medicaid requirements or otherwise amend their state plans to develop costeffective alternatives to longterm care including medicaid payments for assisted living and home health as of september 30 2015 16 of our 44 seniors housing operators received medicaid reimbursement pursuant to medicaid waiver programs for the twelve months ended september 30 2015 approximately 14 of the revenues at our seniors housing facilities were from medicaid reimbursement there can be no guarantee that a state medicaid program operating pursuant to a waiver will be able to maintain its waiver status 

  

  rates paid by selfpay residents are set by the facilities and are determined by local market conditions and operating costs generally facilities receive a higher payment per day for a private pay resident than for a medicaid beneficiary who requires a comparable level of care the level of medicaid reimbursement varies from state to state thus the revenues generated by operators of our assisted living facilities may be adversely affected by payor mix acuity level changes in medicaid eligibility and reimbursement levels in addition a state could lose its medicaid waiver and no longer be permitted to utilize medicaid dollars to reimburse for assisted living services changes in revenues could in turn have a material adverse effect on an operator’s ability to meet its obligations to us 

  

  longtermpostacute care facilities  approximately 14 of our overall revenues for the year ended december 31 2015 were attributable to longtermpostacute care facilities the majority of the revenues received by the operators of these facilities are from the medicare and medicaid programs with the balance representing reimbursement payments from private payors including private insurers consequently changes in federal or state reimbursement policies may adversely affect an operator’s ability to cover its expenses including our rent or debt service longtermpostacute care facilities are subject to periodic pre and postpayment reviews and other audits by federal and state authorities a review or audit of a property operator’s claims could result in recoupments denials or delay of payments in the future which could have a material adverse effect on the operator’s ability to meet its financial obligations to us due to the significant judgments and estimates inherent in payor settlement accounting no assurance can be given as to the adequacy of any reserves maintained by our property operators to cover potential adjustments to reimbursements or to cover settlements made to payors recent attention on billing practices payments and quality of care or ongoing government pressure to reduce spending by government health care programs could result in lower payments to longtermpostacute care facilities and as a result may impair an operator’s ability to meet its financial obligations to us 

  

  medicare reimbursement and longtermpostacute care facilities   for the twelve months ended september 30 2015 approximately 34 of the revenues at our longtermpostacute care facilities were paid by medicare generally longtermpostacute care facilities are reimbursed under the medicare skilled nursing facility prospective payment system “snf pps” the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system “irf pps” or the long term care hospital prospective payment system “ltch pps” there is a risk under these payment systems that costs will exceed the fixed payments or that payments may be set below the costs to provide certain items and services which could result in immediate financial difficulties for operators and could cause operators to seek bankruptcy protection 

  

  the cms an agency of the department of health and human services “hhs” made positive payment updates for the 2016 fiscal year under the snf pss the irf pps and the ltch pps 

·   on august 4 2015 cms published a final rule regarding fiscal year 2016 “fy16” medicare payment rates for skilled nursing facilities “snfs” under the rule cms projects that aggregate payments to snfs will increase by 430 million or 12 from payments in fiscal year 2015 

  

·   on august 6 2015 cms published a final rule for the irf pps under the final rule inpatient rehabilitation facilities “irfs” will receive a net increase of 18 accounting for adjustments such as the multifactor productivity adjustment an additional 01 increase to aggregate payments due to updating the outlier threshold results in an overall update of 18 relative to payments in fiscal year 2015 cms estimates aggregate payments to irfs will increase by 135 million in fiscal year 2016 

·   on august 17 2015 cms published a final rule regarding fy16 medicare payment rates for longterm care hospitals “ltchs” under the rule standard ltch pps rates will increase 17 cms projects overall payments to ltchs under the rule would decrease by 46 or 250 million due to the statutory decrease in payment rates for site neutral ltch pps cases site neutral ltch pps cases do not meet the clinical criteria to qualify for the higher standard ltch pps payment rates 

  

  other laws regulations proposed and final and initiatives affecting medicare reimbursement for ltchs snfs and irfs  on december 26 2013 the president signed into law the pathway for sgr reform act “sgr reform” sgr reform implemented several changes to the medicare payment rules for ltchs for a discharge in cost reporting periods beginning on or after october 1 2015 specified cases in ltchs will receive the “applicable” siteneutral payment rate specifically payment rates will be blended for discharges in cost reporting periods beginning in fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2017 consisting of half of the site neutral payment rate and half of the payment rate that would otherwise apply and then shift to all siteneutral payments in fiscal year 2018 patients with a threeday stay in an intensive care unit prior to ltch admission or ventilator patients with at least 96 hours are exempted from the lower siteneutral payments if the discharge does not have a principal diagnosis relating to a psychiatric diagnosis or to rehabilitation beginning in fiscal year 2020 ltchs are to maintain at least 50 of patients that are excluded from the siteneutral payments sgr reform also requires the medicare payment advisory committee “medpac” to conduct a study and submit a report to congress by june 30 2019 that includes recommendations that address these changes to the ltch payment policies additionally beginning in fiscal year 2016 calculation of length of stay requirements for ltchs will exclude any patients for whom payment is made i at the siteneutral payment rate and ii under any medicare advantage plan sgr reform also delayed implementation of a limit of no more than 25 of patients referred from any one hospital “25 rule” for another three years and the secretary of hhs must issue a report in two years on the need for any further extension or modifications to the 25 rule finally sgr reform reinstituted a moratorium on new ltchs or any increase in ltch beds from january 1 2015 through september 30 2017 

  

  on april 1 2014 the protecting access to medicare act of 2014 “access to medicare act” was enacted the access to medicare act implements valuebased purchasing for snfs beginning in fiscal year 2019 2 of snf payments will be withheld and approximately 50 to 70 of the amount withheld will be paid to snfs through valuebased payments snfs began reporting the claimsbased 30day allcause readmission measure on october 1 2015 and will begin reporting a resource use measure by october 1 2016 both measures will be publicly available by october 1 2017 

  

  on october 6 2014 the president signed into law the improving medicare postacute transformation act of 2014 “impact act” the law applies to snfs ltchs irfs and home health agencies and requires providers to report standardized patient assessment data data on quality measures and data on resource use and other measures the law requires public reporting of quality and resource use and other measures medpac is required to submit a report to congress by june 30 2016 evaluating and recommending features of a postacute payment system that establishes payment rates according to individual characteristics instead of the postacute setting where the patient is treated the report must include a technical prototype for a postacute prospective payment system and the impact of moving from the current to the new payment system 

  

  on july 16 2015 cms issued a proposed rule that for the first time in nearly 25 years would comprehensively update the snf requirements for participation under medicare and medicaid among other things the proposed rule addresses requirements relating to quality of care and quality of life facility responsibilities and staffing considerations resident assessments and compliance and ethics programs cms estimates that this rule would result in an estimated firstyear cost of approximately 46491 per facility and a subsequentyear cost of 40685 per facility on 15691 ltchs 

  

  on november 24 2015 cms published a final rule to bundle the costs for lower extremity joint replacement procedures in certain geographic areas the bundle will begin with the hospital admission and continue for 90 days following hospital discharge the following services among others will be included physician services inpatient hospital services including readmission ltch inpatient rehabilitation snf andor home health services hospital outpatient services outpatient therapy clinical lab and hospice hospitals subject to the bundling requirements with spending below an established target price that meet the threshold on certain quality measures could earn a reconciliation payment from medicare hospitals with spending that exceeds the target will need to pay the difference to medicare 

  

  on december 1 2015 cms published a notice seeking comments on the methodology used to cut medicare part a hospital reimbursement by 02 as part of the original “twomidnight” payment policy the notice was issued in response to a federal district court’s finding in september that cms did not adequately explain its reasoning for the 02 pay cut in 2013 in accordance with the 

  

federal district court’s order in shands jacksonville medical center inc et al v burwell no 14263 ddc  the notice discusses the basis for the 02 reduction and its underlying assumptions and invites comments on the same to facilitate the cms’s further consideration of the fiscal year 2014 reduction 

  

  finally in january 2016 medpac finalized its recommendations advising congress that medicare payments should remain the same in fiscal year 2017 for ltchs and irfs among other institutions the final recommendations also urge congress to eliminate the market basket updates for snfs for fiscal year 2017 and 2018 and direct the secretary of hhs to revise the snf prospective payment system to the extent such recommendations are implemented they could impact our operators and tenants 

  

  hhs office of inspector general “oig” recommendations addressing snf billing in the oig’s march 2015 compendium of priority recommendations a report that highlights the oig’s previous recommendations for which corrective action has not been completed the oig cited its prior november 2012 report addressing questionable billing practices by snfs the oig recommended among other things changing the current method for determining how much therapy is needed to ensure appropriate payments monitoring compliance with new therapy assessments and improving accuracy of data submitted by snfs similarly in june 2015 the oig issued a report analyzing cms’ assessments related to changes in the amount of therapy that a beneficiary receives during stays the oig concluded that cms’ new policies create challenges for oversight and that snfs’ use of these assessments cost medicare 143 million over two years the oig recommended among other things that cms 1 reduce the financial incentive for snfs to use assessments differently when decreasing and increasing therapy and 2 accelerate its efforts to implement a new method for paying for therapy oig also issued a report in september 2015 calling for reevaluation of the medicare payment system for skilled nursing facilities in particular oig found that medicare payments for therapy greatly exceeded snfs’ costs for therapy and that under the current payment system snfs increasingly billed for the highest level of therapy even though key beneficiary characteristics remained largely the same oig determined that its findings demonstrated the need for cms to reevaluate the medicare snf payment system concluding that payment reform could save medicare billions of dollars and encourage snfs to provide services that are better aligned with beneficiaries’ care needs most recently oig issued 1 its findings regarding the fiscal year 2015 top management and performance challenges facing hhs and 2 the fy 2016 oig work plan both cited snf billing as an area that creates incentives for providers to bill more expensive care instead of the appropriate levels of care requiring ongoing government monitoring and auditing for compliance if followed these reports and recommendations may impact our operators and tenants 

  

  medicare reimbursement for physicians hospital outpatient departments and ambulatory surgical centers   historically cms annually adjusted the medicare physician fee schedule payment rates based on an update formula that included application of the sustainable growth rate “sgr” as noted above on april 1 2014 president obama signed into law the access to medicare act which among other things provided for a 0 update to the 2015 medicare physician fee schedule through march 31 2015 on november 13 2014 cms published the calendar year 2015 physician fee schedule final rule which consistent with the access to medicare act called for a 0 update from january 1 2015 through march 31 2015 and a negative 212 update under the statutory sgr formula for april 1 2015 through december 31 2015 however on april 16 2015 president obama signed and enacted into law hr 2 the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of 2015 which among other things 

·   repeals the sgr 

·   institutes a 0 update to the single conversion factor under the medicare physician fee schedule from january 1 through june 30 2015 a 05 update for july 2015 through the end of 2019 and a 0 update for 2020 through 2025 for 2026 and subsequent years the update will be either 075 or 025 depending on which alternate payment model the physician participates 

·   delays the geographic practice cost indices payment adjustment until january 1 2018 

·   extends the therapy cap exceptions process through december 31 2017 and 

·   imposes a market basket update of 1 for skilled nursing providers for fy 2018 

  

  also on april 6 2015 cms announced final 2016 payment rates for medicare advantage with an expected average payment impact of 325 changes in medicare advantage plan payments may indirectly affect our operators and tenants that contract with medicare advantage plans 

  

  additionally the bipartisan budget act of 2015 enacted on november 2 2015 contains a provision that alters how much medicare pays for outpatient services furnished by hospitals pursuant to section 603 of the act effective january 1 2017 an offcampus hospital outpatient department “hopd” will no longer qualify for medicare payment under the hospital outpatient prospective payment system unless the offcampus hopd was established prior to the date of enactment november 2 2015 and medicare payment will instead be made under the applicable nonhospital payment system ie the physician fee schedule or ambulatory surgical center “asc” system which typically provides for lower payment rates this siteneutrality provision is intended to address policymakers’ concerns that medicare’s current payment policies incentivize hospitals to acquire and label physician practices and ascs as hopds due to higher rates available for services furnished in hospital outpatient settings it is unclear whether this provision will significantly impact welltower’s operators and tenants 

  

  

  cms also issued additional rules which could impact our tenants and operators 

·   on november 13 2015 cms published a final rule regarding 2016 medicare payment rates for hopds and ascs under the rule cms reduced payments to hopds by 03 and increased payments to ascs by 03 the final rule also included updates to the “twomidnight” rule regarding when inpatient admissions are appropriate for payment under medicare part a under the final rule an inpatient admission lasting less than two midnights would be payable under medicare part a on a casebycase basis based on the judgment of the admitting physician supported by documentation in the medical record 

·   on november 16 2015 cms published a final rule regarding 2016 medicare payment rates under the physician fee schedule among other final policies cms finalized its plans to initiate implementation of the new payment system for physicians and other practitioners the meritbased incentive payment system “mips” required by the legislation that repealed the sgr under the legislation the mips will be fully implemented in calendar year 2019 

  

  medicaid reimbursement and longtermpostacute care facilities   for the twelve months ended september 30 2015 approximately 41 of the revenues of longtermpostacute care facilities were paid by medicaid the federal and state governments share responsibility for financing medicaid the federal matching rate known as the federal medical assistance percentage varies by state based on relative per capita income but is at least 50 in all states according to the national association of state budget officers medicaid was the largest component of total state spending representing approximately 274 of total state expenditures in state fiscal year 2015 the percentage of medicaid dollars for longtermpostacute care facilities varies from state to state due in part to different ratios of elderly population and eligibility requirements within certain federal guidelines states have a fairly wide range of discretion to determine eligibility and reimbursement methodology many states reimburse snfs for example using fixed daily rates which are applied prospectively based on patient acuity and the historical costs incurred in providing patient care reasonable costs typically include allowances for staffing administrative and general expenses property and equipment  eg  real estate taxes depreciation and fair rental 

  

  in most states medicaid does not fully reimburse the cost of providing services certain states are attempting to slow the rate of medicaid growth by freezing rates or restricting eligibility and benefits average medicaid rates for our longtermpostacute care facilities will likely vary throughout the year as states continue to make interim changes to their budgets and medicaid funding in addition medicaid reimbursement rates may decline if revenues in a particular state are not sufficient to fund budgeted expenditures 

  

  health reform laws on march 23 2010 the president signed into law the ppaca and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 which amends the ppaca collectively the “health reform laws” the health reform laws contain various provisions that may directly impact us or the operators and tenants of our properties some provisions of the health reform laws may have a positive impact on our operators’ or tenants’ revenues by for example increasing coverage of uninsured individuals while others may have a negative impact on the reimbursement of our operators or tenants by for example altering the market basket adjustments for certain types of health care facilities the health reform laws also enhance certain fraud and abuse penalty provisions that could apply to our operators and tenants in the event of one or more violations of the federal health care regulatory laws in addition there are provisions that impact the health coverage that we and our operators and tenants provide to our respective employees the health reform laws also provide additional medicaid funding to allow states to carry out the expansion of medicaid coverage to certain financially−eligible individuals beginning in 2014 and have also permitted states to expand their medicaid coverage to these individuals since april 1 2010 if certain conditions are met on june 28 2012 the united states supreme court upheld the individual mandate of the health reform laws but partially invalidated the expansion of medicaid the ruling on medicaid expansion will allow states not to participate in the expansion – and to forego funding for the medicaid expansion – without losing their existing medicaid funding given that the federal government substantially funds the medicaid expansion it is unclear how many states will ultimately pursue this option the participation by states in the medicaid expansion could have the dual effect of increasing our tenants’ revenues through new patients but could also further strain state budgets while the federal government will pay for approximately 100 of those additional costs from 2014 to 2016 states will be expected to pay for part of those additional costs beginning in 2017 

  

  challenges to the health reform laws  since the enactment of the health care laws there have been multiple attempts through legislative action and legal challenge to repeal or amend the health reform laws including the case that was before the us supreme court king v burwell  although the supreme court in burwell upheld the use of subsidies to individuals in federallyfacilitated health care exchanges on june 25 2015 which ultimately did not disrupt significantly the implementation of the health care reform laws we cannot predict whether other current or future efforts to repeal or amend the health reform laws will be successful nor can we predict the impact that such a repeal or amendment would have on our operators or tenants and their ability to meet their obligations to us 

  

  we cannot predict whether the existing health reform laws or future health care reform legislation or regulatory changes will have a material impact on our operators’ or tenants’ property or business if the operations cash flows or financial condition of our operators and tenants are materially adversely impacted by the health reform laws or future legislation our revenue and operations may be adversely affected as well 

  

  

other related laws initiatives and considerations 

  

  longtermpostacute care facilities and seniors housing facilities that receive medicaid payments are subject to federal state and local laws regulations and applicable guidance that govern the operations and financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by health care providers certain of these laws prohibit direct or indirect payments of any kind for the purpose of inducing or encouraging the referral of patients for medical products or services reimbursable by government health care programs other laws require providers to furnish only medically necessary services and submit to the government valid and accurate statements for each service still other laws require providers to comply with a variety of safety health and other requirements relating to the condition of the licensed property and the quality of care provided sanctions for violations of these laws regulations and other applicable guidance may include but are not limited to criminal andor civil penalties and fines loss of licensure immediate termination of government payments and exclusion from any government health care program in certain circumstances violation of these rules such as those prohibiting abusive and fraudulent behavior with respect to one property may subject other facilities under common control or ownership to sanctions including exclusion from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs as well as other government health care programs in the ordinary course of its business a property operator is regularly subjected to inquiries investigations and audits by the federal and state agencies that oversee these laws and regulations 

  

  longtermpostacute care facilities and seniors housing facilities that receive medicaid payments are also subject to the federal antikickback statute which generally prohibits persons from offering providing soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing of a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal health care program such as medicare or medicaid longtermpostacute care facilities are also subject to the federal ethics in patient referral act of 1989 commonly referred to as the stark law the stark law generally prohibits the submission of claims to medicare for payment if the claim results from a physician referral for certain designated services and the physician has a financial relationship with the health service provider that does not qualify under one of the exceptions for a financial relationship under the stark law similar prohibitions on physician selfreferrals and submission of claims apply to state medicaid programs further longtermpostacute care facilities and seniors housing facilities that receive medicaid payments are subject to substantial financial penalties under the civil monetary penalties act and the federal false claims act and in particular actions under the federal false claims act’s “whistleblower” provisions private enforcement of health care fraud has increased due in large part to amendments to the federal false claims act that encourage private individuals to sue on behalf of the government these whistleblower suits brought by private individuals known as qui tam actions may be filed by almost anyone including present and former patients nurses and other employees and competitors significantly if a claim is successfully adjudicated the federal false claims act provides for treble damages up to 11000 per claim 

  

  prosecutions investigations or whistleblower actions could have a material adverse effect on a property operator’s liquidity financial condition and operations which could adversely affect the ability of the operator to meet its financial obligations to us finally various state false claim act and antikickback laws may also apply to each property operator violation of any of the foregoing statutes can result in criminal andor civil penalties that could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its financial obligations to us 

  

  other legislative developments including the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” have greatly expanded the definition of health care fraud and related offenses and broadened its scope to include private health care plans in addition to government payors congress also has greatly increased funding for the department of justice federal bureau of investigation and the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services to audit investigate and prosecute suspected health care fraud moreover a significant portion of the billions in health care fraud recoveries over the past several years has also been returned to government agencies to further fund their fraud investigation and prosecution efforts 

  

  additionally other hipaa provisions and regulations provide for communication of health information through standard electronic transaction formats and for the privacy and security of health information in order to comply with the regulations health care providers often must undertake significant operational and technical implementation efforts operators also may face significant financial exposure if they fail to maintain the privacy and security of medical records and other personal health information about individuals the health information technology for economic and clinical health “hitech” act passed in february 2009 strengthened the hhs secretary’s authority to impose civil money penalties for hipaa violations occurring after february 18 2009 hitech directs the hhs secretary to provide for periodic audits to ensure covered entities and their business associates as that term is defined under hipaa comply with the applicable hitech requirements increasing the likelihood that a hipaa violation will result in an enforcement action cms issued an interim final rule which conformed hipaa enforcement regulations to the hitech act increasing the maximum penalty for multiple violations of a single requirement or prohibition to 15 million higher penalties may accrue for violations of multiple requirements or prohibitions additionally on january 17 2013 cms released an omnibus final rule which expands the applicability of hipaa and hitech and strengthens the government’s ability to enforce these laws the final rule broadens the definition of “business associate” and provides for civil money penalty liability against covered entities and business associates for the acts of their agents regardless of whether a business associate agreement is in place this rule also modified the standard for when a breach of unsecured personally identifiable health information must be reported some covered 

  

entities have entered into settlement agreements with hhs for allegedly failing to adopt policies and procedures sufficient to implement the breach notification provisions in the hitech act additionally the final rule adopts certain changes to the hipaa enforcement regulations to incorporate the increased and tiered civil monetary penalty structure provided by hitech and makes business associates of covered entities directly liable under hipaa for compliance with certain of the hipaa privacy standards and hipaa security standards hipaa violations are also potentially subject to criminal penalties 

  

  there has been increased federal and state hipaa privacy and security enforcement efforts and we expect this trend to continue under hitech state attorneys general have the right to prosecute hipaa violations committed against residents of their states several such actions have already been brought against both covered entities and a business associate and continued enforcement actions are likely to occur in the future in addition hitech mandates that the secretary of hhs conduct periodic compliance audits of hipaa covered entities and business associates it also tasks hhs with establishing a methodology whereby individuals who are harmed by hipaa violations may receive a percentage of the civil monetary penalty fine or monetary settlement paid by the violator 

  

  in addition to hipaa numerous other state and federal laws govern the collection dissemination use access to and confidentiality of individually identifiable health information in addition some states are considering new laws and regulations that further protect the confidentiality privacy or security of medical records or other types of medical or personal information these laws may be similar to or even more stringent than the federal provisions and are not preempted by hipaa not only may some of these state laws impose fines and penalties upon violators but some afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused 

  

  most recently with respect to hipaa in september 2015 oig issued two reports calling for better privacy oversight of covered entities the first report titled “ocr should strengthen its oversight of covered entities’ compliance with the hipaa privacy standards” found that ocr’s oversight is primarily reactive as ocr has not fully implemented the required audit program to proactively assess possible noncompliance from covered entities oig recommended among other things that ocr fully implement a permanent audit program and develop a policy requiring ocr staff to check whether covered entities had previously been investigated for noncompliance the second report titled “ocr should strengthen its followup of breaches of patient information reported by covered entities” found that 1 ocr did not record corrective action information for 23 of closed “largebreach” cases in which it made determinations of noncompliance and 2 ocr did not record “smallbreach” information in its casetracking system which limits its ability to track and identify covered entities with multiple small breaches oig recommended among other things that ocr enter smallbreach information into its casetracking system and maintain complete documentation of corrective actions taken ocr agreed with oig’s recommendations in both reports if followed these reports and recommendations may impact our operators and tenants 

  

  in november 2002 cms began an ongoing national nursing home quality initiative “nhqi” under this initiative historical survey information the nhqi pilot evaluation report and the nhqi overview is made available to the public online the nhqi website provides consumer and provider information regarding the quality of care in nursing homes the data allows consumers providers states and researchers to compare quality information that shows how well nursing homes are caring for their residents’ physical and clinical needs the posted nursing home quality measures come from resident assessment data that nursing homes routinely collect on the residents at specified intervals during their stay if the operators of nursing facilities are unable to achieve quality of care ratings that are comparable or superior to those of their competitors they may lose market share to other facilities reducing their revenues and adversely impacting their ability to make rental payments 

  

  in addition recent government proposals have resulted in an increased emphasis by the government on the quality of care provided by providers for example on february 27 2015 cms announced the establishment of a health care payment learning and action network as part of its plan to shift the medicare program and the healthcare system at large toward paying providers based on quality rather than the quantity of care they provide to patients through the learning and action network cms will work with private payers employers consumers providers states and state medicaid programs and other partners to expand alternative payment models into their programs to the extent this and similar measures impose additional obligations on our operators or tenants or decrease the reimbursements that they receive our revenues and operations may be indirectly adversely affected 

  

  in october 2015 the us government accountability office “gao” released a report recommending that cms continue to improve data and oversight of nursing home quality measures the gao found that although cms collects several types of data that give some insight into the quality of nursing homes the data could provide a clearer picture of nursing home quality if some underlying problems with the data  ie  the use of selfreported data and nonstandardized survey methodologies are corrected the gao recommends among other things that cms implement a clear plan for ongoing auditing of selfreported data and establish a process for monitoring oversight modifications to better assess their effects according to the gao timely completion of these actions is particularly important because medicare payments to nursing homes will be dependent on quality data through the implementation of the value based purchasing program starting in fiscal year 2019 hhs agreed with the gao’s recommendations and to the extent such recommendations are implemented they could impact welltower’s operators and tenants 

  

  

  according to the us centers for disease control and prevention it is not possible to predict the severity of the upcoming flu season or the efficacy of available flu vaccinations the us experiences epidemics of seasonal flu each year which result in increased influenzarelated hospitalizations and deaths according to hhs each flu season nearly 111 million workdays are lost due to the flu which equals approximately 7 billion per year in sick days and lost productivity as such depending on the severity and duration of the upcoming flu season the flu could impact welltower’s operators and tenants 

  

  finally government investigations and enforcement actions brought against the health care industry have increased dramatically over the past several years and are expected to continue some of these enforcement actions represent novel legal theories and expansions in the application of the federal false claims act the costs for an operator of a health care property associated with both defending such enforcement actions and the undertakings in settling these actions can be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its obligations to us

registration 

  

  in england care home services are principally regulated by the health and social care act 2008 the “act” and associated regulations the act requires all persons carrying out “regulated activities” in england and the managers of such persons to be registered regulated activities are defined in the health and social care act 2008 regulated activities regulations 2014 as amended the “2014 regulations” and include among other activities 

·   the provision of personal care for persons who by reason of old age illness or disability are unable to provide it for themselves and which is provided in a place where those persons are living at the time the care is provided and 

·   the provision of residential accommodation together with nursing or personal care 

  

  from april 1 2015 the 2014 regulations fully revoked the health and social care act 2008 regulated activities regulations 2010 the “2010 regulations” and while the 2014 regulations introduce certain modifications with regard to service standards the registration obligations under the act remain 

  

service standards and notification obligations 

  

  the 2014 regulations aim to streamline the legal obligations in the 2010 regulations and replace them with a set of more broadlyphrased legally binding “fundamental standards” the 2014 regulations list the standards that must be met when providing care services the service providers’ legal obligations include 

·   care and treatment must be appropriate and reflect service user needs and preferences 

·   service users must be treated with dignity and respect 

·   care and treatment must only be provided with consent 

·   care and treatment must be provided in a safe way for service users 

·   service users must be protected from abuse and improper treatment 

·   service users nutritional and hydration needs must be met 

·   all premises and equipment must be clean secure suitable and used properly 

·   complaints must be investigated and appropriate action taken 

·   systems and processes must be established to ensure compliance with fundamental standards 

·   sufficient numbers of suitably qualified competent skilled and experienced staff must be deployed 

·   persons employed must be of good character having the necessary qualifications skills and experience and be able to perform the work for which they are employed and 

·   health service bodies must be open and transparent with service users about their care and treatment 

  

  failure to comply with certain provisions of the 2014 regulations is an offense with a person guilty of the offense liable on summary conviction to a fine monetary penalty notices may also be issued 

  

  the 2014 regulations also include 

·   requirements around fit and proper persons being employed for the purposes of carrying out a regulated activity such persons must be of good character have the qualifications competence skills and experience necessary and be able by reason of their health to perform their tasks recruitment procedures must also be established and effectively operated with certain specified information being available in relation to each person employed and registered where required 

·   a new “duty of candour” to notify and apologize to affected persons in the event of certain incidents having actually or potentially led to the death of the service user where the death relates directly to the incident rather than to the natural course of the service users illness or underlying condition or severe harm moderate harm or prolonged psychological harm to the service user 

  

·   a requirement for a service provider to display a performance assessment received as a rating of its performance by the care quality commission the “cqc” and 

·   a requirement that registered persons have regard to guidance issued by the cqc and any code of practice from the secretary of state in relation to prevention or control of health care associated infections 

  

  under the care quality commission registration regulations 2009 certain matters must be notified to the cqc the government regulatory body overseeing the provision of nursing and other care services in england failure to comply with notification obligations is an offense and a person guilty of an offense is liable on summary conviction to a fine of up to £2500 

  

regulatory oversight and inspections 

  

  the act also sets out the powers and responsibilities of the cqc among other powers the cqc administers the compulsory registration system and issues guidance to care service providers on how to comply with applicable standards set out in legislation 

  

the care act 2014 sets out certain provisions concerning among others 

·   the duty of a local authority to meet the needs of an adult for care and support and a carer’s needs where the registered care provider is unable to carry on a regulated activity because of business failure 

·   the duty of the cqc to assess the financial sustainability of providers subject to its regulatory regime with a view to identifying any threats that such providers may face to their financial sustainability where the cqc identifies a significant risk to financial sustainability it can require the provider to develop a sustainability plan setting out the provider’s plan to mitigate or eliminate risk or require the provider to organize an independent review of the business with the costs being recovered from the provider 

·   the cqc informing local authorities where a registered care provider is likely to become unable to carry on a regulated activity and 

·   a new offense where certain registered care providers supply publish or make available information that is false or misleading in a material respect which can also apply to a director manager or person purporting to act as such of a company 

  

privacy 

  

  in the european union “eu” data protection is governed by the eu data protection directive 9546ec the “data protection directive” the data protection directive has been implemented in the uk by the data protection act 1998 the “act” which entered into force on march 2000 and is enforced by the information commissioner’s office “ico” 

  

  the act applies to a data controller that processes personal data in the context of an establishment in the uk or where not established in the uk in any other state of the european economic area “eea” processes personal data through equipment located in the uk other than for the purposes of transit through the uk under the act a data controller is the person who either alone or jointly or in common with other persons determines the purposes for which and the manner in which any personal data are or are to be processed personal data is widely defined as data which relates to a living individual who can be identified from those data or from those data and other information which is in the possession of or is likely to come into the possession of the data controller sensitive personal data is personal data consisting of information as to the racial or ethnic origin of the data subject hisher political opinions religious beliefs or other beliefs of a similar nature whether heshe is a member of a trade union hisher physical or mental health or condition hisher sexual life and the commission or alleged commission by himher of an offense any proceedings for any offense committed or alleged to have been committed by himher the disposal of such proceedings or the sentence of any court in such proceedings 

  

  the act imposes a number of obligations on the data controller contained in eight data protection principles i personal data must be processed fairly and lawfully ii personal data must be processed for specified and lawful purposes iii personal data must be adequate relevant and not excessive iv personal data must be accurate and up to date v personal data must not be kept for longer than necessary vi personal data must be processed in accordance with the rights of data subjects vii appropriate technical and organizational measures shall be taken against unauthorized or unlawful processing of personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of or damage to personal data and viii there is a prohibition on transfers of personal data to countries outside the eea that are not deemed by the european commission to provide an adequate level of protection which includes the us unless certain exemptions under the act apply 

  

  the ico has a number of enforcement powers available which includes in certain limited cases criminal prosecution and noncriminal enforcement and audits in case of a breach of the act the ico may i provide practical advice to organizations on how they should handle data protection matters ii issue undertakings committing an organization to a particular course of action in order to improve its compliance iii serve enforcement notices where there has been a breach requiring organizations to take or refrain from taking specified steps in order to ensure they comply with the law iv conduct consensual assessments audits to determine if 

  

organizations are complying v serve assessment notices to conduct compulsory audits to assess whether organizations’ processing of personal data follows good data protection practices vi issue monetary penalty notices requiring organizations to pay up to £500000 for serious breaches of the act occurring on or after april 6 2010 or serious breaches of the privacy and electronic communications regulations occurring after may 26 2011 and vii prosecute those who commit criminal offenses under the act under the act individuals also have the right to claim compensation from an organization in respect of damage caused by a breach of any of the requirements of the act 

  

  there is a proposal for an eu data protection regulation which would replace the data protection directive and impose a significant number of new obligations including among others a requirement to appoint data protection officers having detailed documentation on the processing of personal data carrying out privacy impact assessments in certain circumstances providing standardized data protection notices reporting security breaches without undue delay and providing certain rights to individuals such as a right of erasure of personal data the eu data protection regulation is to have significant enforcement powers with fines proposed by the european commission of up to 2 of annual worldwide turnover or €20 million whichever is greater the eu data protection regulation may be adopted sometime in 2016 with eu member states possibly having two years to implement the regulation

  a certificate of compliance is issued for a period of three years is renewable and can only be validly transferred to another person with the written permission of the regional licensing agency an agency may revoke a temporary certificate or revoke or refuse to issue or renew a certificate of compliance if among other things the operator fails to comply with the act and the regulation although the decision of the applicable agency can be contested before the administrative tribunal of québec the agency may also 

  

order the residence to take corrective measures further to an inspection complaint andor investigation the agency is authorized to inspect a residence at any reasonable time of day in order to ascertain whether it complies with the act and the regulation 

  

  private seniors’ residences may belong to either or both of the following two categories those offering services to independent elderly persons and those offering services to semiindependent elderly persons the operator of a residence must for each category comply with the applicable criteria and standards with some exceptions provided for residences with fewer than six or ten rooms or apartments the act and the regulation set out a number of detailed provisions with respect to residents’ health and safety including mandatory callforhelp systems safety plans in the event of fire or infectious disease health assessments permissible control measures as well as administration and distribution of medication meal services and recreation content of residents’ files disclosure of information to residents and staffing requirements among other things

  privacy 

  

  the services provided in our facilities are generally subject to privacy legislation in canada including in certain provinces privacy laws specifically related to personal health information although the obligations of custodians of personal health information in the various provinces differ to some extent they all include the obligation to protect the information the organizations with which we have management agreements may be the custodian of personal health informationpersonal information collected in connection with the operation of our facilities 

  

  privacy laws in canada are consentbased and require the implementation of a privacy program involving policies procedures and the designation of an individual or team with primary responsibility for a custodian’s privacy law compliance mandatory breach notification to the affected individuals is a requirement under some laws mandatory breach notification to the applicable regulator is a requirement under some laws although not yet in effect in some provinces some laws require notification where personal health informationpersonal information is processed or stored outside of canada one provincial law in quebec provides for fines where an organization fails to perform required due diligence before outsourcing activities involving personal information to a service provider outside of the province 

  

  some privacy regulators in canada have ordermaking authority and others are ombudspersons who make recommendations that may only be enforced by a court under a number of privacy laws a finding by a regulator that a custodian has breached the law creates a right to apply to a court for money damages in some provinces there is a statutory civil cause of action for breach of privacy in other provinces the courts have recognized a limited common law cause of action for breach of privacy 

  

  the powers of privacy regulators and penalties for violations of privacy law vary according to the applicable law or are left to the courts to date penalties have generally not been monetary although that is changing with civil actions for breach of privacy and may change further as a result of class action activity regulators have the authority to make public the identity of a custodian that has been found to have committed a breach so that there is a reputational risk associated with privacy law violations even where no monetary damages are incurred the notification of patients mandatory under some privacy laws and other activities required to manage a privacy breach can give rise to significant costs 

  

  other legislation 

  

  retirement homes may be subject to residential tenancy laws such that there can be restrictions on rent increases and termination of tenancies for instance other provincial legislation applicable to occupational health and safety public health and the provision of community health care and funded longtermpostacute care may also apply to retirement homes in addition municipal laws with respect to matters such as fire safety food services and zoning would also apply in this connection in ontario the building code and fire code have been amended to include various safety measures such as mandatory sprinklers selfclosing doors and increased voice communication system requirements with grace periods for compliance with some of the requirements 

  

  in quebec the safety code was amended in december 2015 to require that private seniors’ residences be equipped with a fire alarm and detection system as well as the installation of a sprinkler system in certain private seniors’ residences the amendments come into force march 18 2016 except regarding the installation of the sprinkler system which has a five year grace period and comes into force december 2 2020

general 

  

we elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust a “reit” commencing with our first taxable year we intend to continue to operate in such a manner as to qualify as a reit but there is no guarantee that we will qualify or remain qualified as a reit for subsequent years qualification and taxation as a reit depends upon our ability to meet a variety of qualification tests imposed under federal income tax law with respect to income assets distribution level and diversity of share ownership as discussed below under “— qualification as a reit” there can be no assurance that we will be owned and organized and will operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified 

  

in any year in which we qualify as a reit in general we will not be subject to federal income tax on that portion of our reit taxable income or capital gain that is distributed to stockholders we may however be subject to tax at normal corporate rates on any taxable income or capital gain not distributed if we elect to retain and pay income tax on our net longterm capital gains stockholders are required to include their proportionate share of our undistributed longterm capital gains in income but they will receive a refundable credit for their share of any taxes paid by us on such gain 

  

despite the reit election we may be subject to federal income and excise tax as follows 

  

• to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our “reit taxable income” as adjusted we will be subject to tax on the undistributed amount at regular corporate tax rates 

  

• we may be subject to the “alternative minimum tax” the “amt” on certain tax preference items to the extent that the amt exceeds our regular tax 

  

• if we have net income from the sale or other disposition of “foreclosure property” that is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business or other nonqualifying income from foreclosure property such income will be taxed at the highest corporate rate 

  

• any net income from prohibited transactions which are in general sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business other than dispositions of foreclosure property and dispositions of property due to an involuntary conversion will be subject to a 100 tax 

  

• if we fail to satisfy either the 75 or 95 gross income tests as discussed below but nonetheless maintain our qualification as a reit because certain other requirements are met we will be subject to a 100 tax on an amount equal to 1 the gross income attributable to the greater of i 75 of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75 gross income test discussed below or ii 95 of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 95 gross income test discussed below multiplied by 2 a fraction intended to reflect our profitability 

  

• if we fail to distribute during each year at least the sum of 1 85 of our reit ordinary income for the year 2 95 of our reit capital gain net income for such year other than capital gain that we elect to retain and pay tax on and 3 any undistributed taxable income from preceding periods we will be subject to a 4 excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over amounts actually distributed 

  

• we will be subject to a 100 tax on the amount of any rents from real property deductions or excess interest paid to us by any of our “taxable reit subsidiaries” that would be reduced through reallocation under certain federal income tax principles in order to more clearly reflect income of the taxable reit subsidiary see “— qualification as a reit — investments in taxable reit subsidiaries” and 

  

  

• we may be subject to the corporate “alternative minimum tax” on any items of tax preference including any deductions of net operating losses 

  

if we acquire any assets from a corporation which is or has been a “c” corporation in a carryover basis transaction we could be liable for specified liabilities that are inherited from the “c” corporation a “c” corporation is generally defined as a corporation that is required to pay full corporate level federal income tax if we recognize gain on the disposition of the assets during the fiveyear period beginning on the date on which the assets were acquired by us then to the extent of the assets’ “builtin gain” ie the excess of the fair market value of the asset over the adjusted tax basis in the asset in each case determined as of the beginning of the fiveyear period we will be subject to tax on the gain at the highest regular corporate rate applicable the results described in this paragraph with respect to the recognition of builtin gain assume that the builtin gain assets at the time the builtin gain assets were subject to a conversion transaction either where a “c” corporation elected reit status or a reit acquired the assets from a “c” corporation were not treated as sold to an unrelated party and gain recognized for those properties that are subject to the builtingains tax if triggered by a sale within the fiveyear period beginning on the date on which the properties were acquired by us then the potential amount of builtingains tax will be an additional factor when considering a possible sale of the properties see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the builtin gains tax 

  

qualification as a reit 

  

a reit is defined as a corporation trust or association 

  

1 which is managed by one or more trustees or directors 

  

2 the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest 

  

3 which would be taxable as a domestic corporation but for the federal income tax law relating to reits 

  

4 which is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company 

  

5 the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons in each taxable year of the reit except for its first taxable year 

  

6 not more than 50 in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned during the last half of each taxable year excluding its first taxable year directly or indirectly by or for five or fewer individuals which includes certain entities the “five or fewer requirement” and 

  

7 which meets certain income and asset tests described below 

  

conditions 1 to 4 inclusive must be met during the entire taxable year and condition 5 must be met during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months for purposes of conditions 5 and 6 pension funds and certain other taxexempt entities are treated as individuals subject to a “lookthrough” exception in the case of condition 6 

  

based on publicly available information we believe we have satisfied the share ownership requirements set forth in 5 and 6 above in addition article vi of our bylaws provides for restrictions regarding ownership and transfer of shares these restrictions are intended to assist us in continuing to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in 5 and 6 above these restrictions however may not ensure that we will in all cases be able to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in 5 and 6 above 

  

we have complied with and will continue to comply with regulatory rules to send annual letters to certain of our stockholders requesting information regarding the actual ownership of our stock if despite sending the annual letters we do not know or after exercising reasonable diligence would not have known whether we failed to meet the five or fewer requirement we will be treated as having met the five or fewer requirement if we fail to comply with these regulatory rules we will be subject to a monetary penalty if our failure to comply was due to intentional disregard of the requirement the penalty would be increased however if our failure to comply were due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect no penalty would be imposed 

  

we may own a number of properties through wholly owned subsidiaries a corporation will qualify as a “qualified reit subsidiary” if 100 of its stock is owned by a reit and the reit does not elect to treat the subsidiary as a taxable reit subsidiary a “qualified reit subsidiary” will not be treated as a separate corporation and all assets liabilities and items of income deductions and credits of a “qualified reit subsidiary” will be treated as assets liabilities and items as the case may be of the reit a 

  

“qualified reit subsidiary” is not subject to federal income tax and our ownership of the voting stock of a qualified reit subsidiary will not violate the restrictions against ownership of securities of any one issuer which constitute more than 10 of the value or total voting power of such issuer or more than 5 of the value of our total assets as described below under “— asset tests” 

  

if we invest in a partnership a limited liability company or a trust taxed as a partnership or as a disregarded entity we will be deemed to own a proportionate share of the partnership’s limited liability company’s or trust’s assets likewise we will be treated as receiving our share of the income and loss of the partnership limited liability company or trust and the gross income will retain the same character in our hands as it has in the hands of the partnership limited liability company or trust these “lookthrough” rules apply for purposes of the income tests and assets tests described below 

  

income tests there are two separate percentage tests relating to our sources of gross income that we must satisfy for each taxable year 

  

• at least 75 of our gross income excluding gross income from certain sales of property held primarily for sale must be directly or indirectly derived each taxable year from “rents from real property” other income from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property or certain income from qualified temporary investments 

  

• at least 95 of our gross income excluding gross income from certain sales of property held primarily for sale must be directly or indirectly derived each taxable year from any of the sources qualifying for the 75 gross income test and from dividends including dividends from taxable reit subsidiaries and interest 

  

as to transactions entered into in taxable years beginning after october 22 2004 and on or prior to july 30 2008 any of our income from a “clearly identified” hedging transaction that is entered into by us in the normal course of business directly or indirectly to manage the risk of interest rate movements price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings or obligations incurred or to be incurred by us or such other risks that are prescribed by the internal revenue service is excluded from the 95 gross income test 

  

for transactions entered into after july 30 2008 any of our income from a “clearly identified” hedging transaction that is entered into by us in the normal course of business directly or indirectly to manage the risk of interest rate movements price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings or obligations incurred or to be incurred by us is excluded from the 95 and 75 gross income tests 

  

for transactions entered into after july 30 2008 any of our income from a “clearly identified” hedging transaction entered into by us primarily to manage risk of currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain that is included in gross income in the 95 and 75 gross income tests is excluded from the 95 and 75 gross income tests 

  

in general a hedging transaction is “clearly identified” if 1 the transaction is identified as a hedging transaction before the end of the day on which it is entered into and 2 the items or risks being hedged are identified “substantially contemporaneously” with the hedging transaction an identification is not substantially contemporaneous if it is made more than 35 days after entering into the hedging transaction 

  

as to gains and items of income recognized after july 30 2008 “passive foreign exchange gain” for any taxable year will not constitute gross income for purposes of the 95 gross income test and “real estate foreign exchange gain” for any taxable year will not constitute gross income for purposes of the 75 gross income test real estate foreign exchange gain is foreign currency gain as defined in internal revenue code section 988b1 which is attributable to i any qualifying item of income or gain for purposes of the 75 gross income test ii the acquisition or ownership of obligations secured by mortgages on real property or interests in real property or iii becoming or being the obligor under obligations secured by mortgages on real property or on interests in real property real estate foreign exchange gain also includes internal revenue code section 987 gain attributable to a qualified business unit a “qbu” of a reit if the qbu itself meets the 75 gross income test for the taxable year and the 75 asset test at the close of each quarter that the reit has directly or indirectly held the qbu real estate foreign exchange gain also includes any other foreign currency gain as determined by the secretary of the treasury passive foreign exchange gain includes all real estate foreign exchange gain and foreign currency gain which is attributable to i any qualifying item of income or gain for purposes of the 95 gross income test ii the acquisition or ownership of obligations iii becoming or being the obligor under obligations and iv any other foreign currency gain as determined by the secretary of the treasury 

  

generally other than income from “clearly identified” hedging transactions entered into by us in the normal course of business any foreign currency gain derived by us from dealing or engaging in substantial and regular trading in securities will constitute gross income which does not qualify under the 95 or 75 gross income tests 

  

  

rents received by us will qualify as “rents from real property” for purposes of satisfying the gross income tests for a reit only if several conditions are met 

  

• the amount of rent must not be based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person although rents generally will not be excluded merely because they are based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales 

  

• rents received from a tenant will not qualify as rents from real property if the reit or an owner of 10 or more of the reit also directly or constructively owns 10 or more of the tenant unless the tenant is our taxable reit subsidiary and certain other requirements are met with respect to the real property being rented 

  

• if rent attributable to personal property leased in connection with a lease of real property is greater than 15 of the total rent received under the lease then the portion of rent attributable to such personal property will not qualify as “rents from real property” 

  

• for rents to qualify as rents from real property we generally must not furnish or render services to tenants other than through a taxable reit subsidiary or an “independent contractor” from whom we derive no income except that we may directly provide services that are “usually or customarily rendered” in the geographic area in which the property is located in connection with the rental of real property for occupancy only or are not otherwise considered “rendered to the occupant for his convenience” 

  

• for taxable years beginning after july 30 2008 the reit may lease “ qualified health care properties” on an arm’slength basis to a taxable reit subsidiary if the property is operated on behalf of such subsidiary by a person who qualifies as an “independent contractor” and who is or is related to a person who is actively engaged in the trade or business of operating health care facilities for any person unrelated to us or our taxable reit subsidiary an “ eligible independent contractor  ” generally the rent that the reit receives from the taxable reit subsidiary will be treated as “rents from real property”   a “qualified health care property” includes any real property and any personal property that is or is necessary or incidental to the use of a hospital nursing facility assisted living facility congregate care facility qualified continuing care facility or other licensed facility that extends medical or nursing or ancillary services to patients and is operated by a provider of such services that is eligible for participation in the medicare program with respect to such facility 

  

a reit is permitted to render a de minimis amount of impermissible services to tenants and still treat amounts received with respect to that property as rent from real property the amount received or accrued by the reit during the taxable year for the impermissible services with respect to a property may not exceed 1 of all amounts received or accrued by the reit directly or indirectly from the property the amount received for any service or management operation for this purpose shall be deemed to be not less than 150 of the direct cost of the reit in furnishing or rendering the service or providing the management or operation furthermore impermissible services may be furnished to tenants by a taxable reit subsidiary subject to certain conditions and we may still treat rents received with respect to the property as rent from real property 

  

the term “interest” generally does not include any amount if the determination of the amount depends in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person although an amount generally will not be excluded from the term “interest” solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage of receipts or sales 

  

if we fail to satisfy one or both of the 75 or 95 gross income tests for any taxable year we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for such year if we are eligible for relief these relief provisions generally will be available if 1 following our identification of the failure we file a schedule for such taxable year describing each item of our gross income and 2 the failure to meet such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect 

  

it is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions if these relief provisions apply a 100 tax is imposed on an amount equal to a the gross income attributable to 1 75 of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75 income test and 2 95 of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 95 income test multiplied by b a fraction intended to reflect our profitability 

  

the secretary of the treasury is given broad authority to determine whether particular items of income or gain qualify or not under the 75 and 95 gross income tests or are to be excluded from the measure of gross income for such purposes 

  

asset tests within 30 days after the close of each quarter of our taxable year we must also satisfy several tests relating to the nature and diversification of our assets determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles at least 75 of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets cash cash items including receivables arising in the ordinary course of our operation government securities and qualified temporary investments although the remaining 25 of our assets generally may be invested without restriction we are prohibited from owning securities representing more than 10 of either the vote the “10 vote test” or value the “10 value test” of the outstanding securities of any issuer other than a qualified reit subsidiary 

  

another reit or a taxable reit subsidiary further no more than 25 20 for tax years beginning after 2017 of the total assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries the “25 asset test” and no more than 5 of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities of any nongovernmental issuer other than a qualified reit subsidiary the “5 asset test” another reit or a taxable reit subsidiary each of the 10 vote test the 10 value test and the 25 and 5 asset tests must be satisfied at the end of each quarter there are special rules which provide relief if the value related tests are not satisfied due to changes in the value of the assets of a reit 

  

certain items are excluded from the 10 value test including 1 straight debt securities as defined in internal revenue code section 1361c5 of an issuer including straight debt that provides certain contingent payments 2 any loan to an individual or an estate 3 any rental agreement described in section 467 of the internal revenue code other than with a “related person” 4 any obligation to pay rents from real property 5 certain securities issued by a state or any subdivision thereof the district of columbia a foreign government or any political subdivision thereof or the commonwealth of puerto rico 6 any security issued by a reit and 7 any other arrangement that as determined by the secretary of the treasury is excepted from the definition of security “excluded securities” special rules apply to straight debt securities issued by corporations and entities taxable as partnerships for federal income tax purposes if a reit or its taxable reit subsidiary holds 1 straight debt securities of a corporate or partnership issuer and 2 securities of such issuer that are not excluded securities and have an aggregate value greater than 1 of such issuer’s outstanding securities the straight debt securities will be included in the 10 value test 

  

a reit’s interest as a partner in a partnership is not treated as a security for purposes of applying the 10 value test to securities issued by the partnership further any debt instrument issued by a partnership will not be a security for purposes of applying the 10 value test 1 to the extent of the reit’s interest as a partner in the partnership and 2 if at least 75 of the partnership’s gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions would qualify for the 75 gross income test for purposes of the 10 value test a reit’s interest in a partnership’s assets is determined by the reit’s proportionate interest in any securities issued by the partnership other than the excluded securities described in the preceding paragraph 

  

for taxable years beginning after july 30 2008 if the reit or its qbu uses a foreign currency as its functional currency the term “cash” includes such foreign currency but only to the extent such foreign currency is i held for use in the normal course of the activities of the reit or qbu which give rise to items of income or gain that are included in the 95 and 75 gross income tests or are directly related to acquiring or holding assets qualifying under the 75 asset test and ii not held in connection with dealing or engaging in substantial and regular trading in securities 

  

with respect to corrections of failures as to violations of the 10 vote test the 10 value test or the 5 asset test a reit may avoid disqualification as a reit by disposing of sufficient assets to cure a violation that does not exceed the lesser of 1 of the reit’s assets at the end of the relevant quarter or 10000000 provided that the disposition occurs within six months following the last day of the quarter in which the reit first identified the assets for violations of any of the reit asset tests due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that exceed the thresholds described in the preceding sentence a reit can avoid disqualification as a reit after the close of a taxable quarter by taking certain steps including disposition of sufficient assets within the six month period described above to meet the applicable asset test paying a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets during the period of time that the assets were held as nonqualifying assets and filing a schedule with the internal revenue service that describes the nonqualifying assets 

  

investments in taxable reit subsidiaries   reits may own more than 10 of the voting power and value of securities in taxable reit subsidiaries unlike a qualified reit subsidiary other disregarded entity or partnership the income and assets of a taxable reit subsidiary are not attributable to the reit for purposes of satisfying the income and asset ownership requirements applicable to reit qualification we and any taxable corporate entity in which we own an interest are allowed to jointly elect to treat such entity as a “taxable reit subsidiary” 

  

certain of our subsidiaries have elected to be treated as a taxable reit subsidiary taxable reit subsidiaries are subject to full corporate level federal taxation on their earnings but are permitted to engage in certain types of activities that cannot be performed directly by reits without jeopardizing their reit status our taxable reit subsidiaries will attempt to minimize the amount of these taxes but there can be no assurance whether or the extent to which measures taken to minimize taxes will be successful to the extent our taxable reit subsidiaries are required to pay federal state or local taxes the cash available for distribution as dividends to us from our taxable reit subsidiaries will be reduced 

  

the amount of interest on relatedparty debt that a taxable reit subsidiary may deduct is limited further a 100 tax applies to any interest payments by a taxable reit subsidiary to its affiliated reit to the extent the interest rate is not commercially reasonable a taxable reit subsidiary is permitted to deduct interest payments to unrelated parties without any of these restrictions 

  

the internal revenue service may reallocate costs between a reit and its taxable reit subsidiary where there is a lack of arm’slength dealing between the parties any deductible expenses allocated away from a taxable reit subsidiary would increase its tax liability further any amount by which a reit understates its deductions and overstates those of its taxable reit subsidiary may subject to certain exceptions be subject to a 100 tax additional taxable reit subsidiary elections may be made in the future for additional entities in which we obtain an interest 

  

  

  annual distribution requirements in order to avoid being taxed as a regular corporation we are required to make distributions other than capital gain distributions to our stockholders which qualify for the dividends paid deduction in an amount at least equal to 1 the sum of i 90 of our “reit taxable income” computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain and ii 90 of the aftertax net income if any from foreclosure property minus 2 a portion of certain items of noncash income these distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for that year and if paid on or before the first regular distribution payment after such declaration prior to recently enacted legislation with respect to all reits the amount distributed could not be preferential this means that every stockholder of the class of stock to which a distribution is made must be treated the same as every other stockholder of that class and no class of stock may be treated otherwise than in accordance with its dividend rights as a class the “preferential dividend rule” beginning in tax years after 2014 the preferential dividend rule no longer applies to publicly offered reits however the rule is still applicable to other entities taxed as reits which would include several of our subsidiaries to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our “reit taxable income” as adjusted we will be subject to tax on the undistributed amount at regular corporate tax rates as discussed above we may be subject to an excise tax if we fail to meet certain other distribution requirements we believe we have satisfied the annual distribution requirements for the year of our initial reit election and each year thereafter through the year ended december 31 2015 although we intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy these annual distribution requirements for subsequent years economic market legal tax or other factors could limit our ability to meet those requirements see “item 1a — risk factors” 

  

it is also possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90 distribution requirement or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation due to among other things 1 timing differences between i the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses and ii the inclusion of income and deduction of expenses in arriving at our taxable income or 2 the payment of severance benefits that may not be deductible to us in the event that timing differences occur we may find it necessary to arrange for borrowings or if possible pay dividends in the form of taxable stock dividends in order to meet the distribution requirement 

  

under certain circumstances in the event of a deficiency determined by the internal revenue service we may be able to rectify a resulting failure to meet the distribution requirement for a year by paying “deficiency dividends” to stockholders in a later year which may be included in our deduction for distributions paid for the earlier year thus we may be able to avoid being taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends however we will be required to pay applicable penalties and interest based upon the amount of any deduction taken for deficiency dividend distributions 

  

  failure to qualify as a reit 

  

if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates distributions to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify as a reit will not be deductible nor will any particular amount of distributions be required to be made in any year all distributions to stockholders will be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these distributions and subject to certain limitations will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporate stockholders unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions we also will be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to statutory relief failure to qualify for even one year could result in our need to incur indebtedness or liquidate investments in order to pay potentially significant resulting tax liabilities 

  

in addition to the relief described above under “— income tests” and “— asset tests” relief is available in the event that we violate a provision of the internal revenue code that would result in our failure to qualify as a reit if 1 the violation is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect 2 we pay a penalty of 50000 for each failure to satisfy the provision and 3 the violation does not include a violation described under “— income tests” or “— asset tests” above it is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions 

  

federal income taxation of holders of our stock 

  

treatment of taxable us stockholders the following summary applies to you only if you are a “us stockholder” a “us stockholder” is a holder of shares of stock who for united states federal income tax purposes is 

  

• a citizen or resident of the united states 

  

• a corporation partnership or other entity classified as a corporation or partnership for these purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the united states or of any political subdivision of the united states including any state 

  

• an estate the income of which is subject to united states federal income taxation regardless of its source or 

  

  

• a trust if in general a us court is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or more us persons within the meaning of the internal revenue code has the authority to control all of the trust’s substantial decisions 

  

so long as we qualify for taxation as a reit distributions on shares of our stock made out of the current or accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these distributions and not designated as capital gain dividends will be includable as ordinary income for federal income tax purposes none of these distributions will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for us corporate stockholders 

  

generally the current maximum marginal rate of tax payable by individuals on dividends received from corporations that are subject to a corporate level of tax is 20 except in limited circumstances this tax rate will not apply to dividends paid to you by us on our shares because generally we are not subject to federal income tax on the portion of our reit taxable income or capital gains distributed to our stockholders the reduced maximum federal income tax rate will apply to that portion if any of dividends received by you with respect to our shares that are attributable to 1 dividends received by us from nonreit corporations or other taxable reit subsidiaries 2 income from the prior year with respect to which we were required to pay federal corporate income tax during the prior year if for example we did not distribute 100 of our reit taxable income for the prior year or 3 the amount of any earnings and profits that were distributed by us and accumulated in a nonreit year 

  

distributions that are designated as capital gain dividends will be taxed as longterm capital gains to the extent they do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year without regard to the period for which you held our stock however if you are a corporation you may be required to treat a portion of some capital gain dividends as ordinary income 

  

if we elect to retain and pay income tax on any net longterm capital gain you would include in income as longterm capital gain your proportionate share of this net longterm capital gain you would also receive a refundable tax credit for your proportionate share of the tax paid by us on such retained capital gains and you would have an increase in the basis of your shares of our stock in an amount equal to your includable capital gains less your share of the tax deemed paid 

  

you may not include in your federal income tax return any of our net operating losses or capital losses federal income tax rules may also require that certain minimum tax adjustments and preferences be apportioned to you in addition any distribution declared by us in october november or december of any year on a specified date in any such month shall be treated as both paid by us and received by you on december 31 of that year provided that the distribution is actually paid by us no later than january 31 of the following year 

  

we will be treated as having sufficient earnings and profits to treat as a dividend any distribution up to the amount required to be distributed in order to avoid imposition of the 4 excise tax discussed under “— general” and “— qualification as a reit — annual distribution requirements” above as a result you may be required to treat as taxable dividends certain distributions that would otherwise result in a taxfree return of capital moreover any “deficiency dividend” will be treated as a dividend an ordinary dividend or a capital gain dividend as the case may be regardless of our earnings and profits any other distributions in excess of current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to you to the extent these distributions do not exceed the adjusted tax basis of your shares of our stock you will be required to reduce the tax basis of your shares of our stock by the amount of these distributions until the basis has been reduced to zero after which these distributions will be taxable as capital gain if the shares of our stock are held as capital assets the tax basis as so reduced will be used in computing the capital gain or loss if any realized upon sale of the shares of our stock any loss upon a sale or exchange of shares of our stock which were held for six months or less after application of certain holding period rules will generally be treated as a longterm capital loss to the extent you previously received capital gain distributions with respect to these shares of our stock 

  

upon the sale or exchange of any shares of our stock to or with a person other than us or a sale or exchange of all shares of our stock whether actually or constructively owned with us you will generally recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your adjusted tax basis in these shares of our stock this gain will be capital gain if you held these shares of our stock as a capital asset 

  

if we redeem any of your shares in us the treatment can only be determined on the basis of particular facts at the time of redemption in general you will recognize gain or loss as opposed to dividend income equal to the difference between the amount received by you in the redemption and your adjusted tax basis in your shares redeemed if such redemption 1 results in a “complete termination” of your interest in all classes of our equity securities 2 is a “substantially disproportionate redemption” or 3 is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” with respect to you in applying these tests you must take into account your ownership of all classes of our equity securities eg common stock preferred stock depositary shares and warrants you also must take into account any equity securities that are considered to be constructively owned by you 

  

  

if as a result of a redemption by us of your shares you no longer own either actually or constructively any of our equity securities or only own actually and constructively an insubstantial percentage of our equity securities then it is probable that the redemption of your shares would be considered “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” and thus would result in gain or loss to you however whether a distribution is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” depends on all of the facts and circumstances and if you rely on any of these tests at the time of redemption you should consult your tax advisor to determine their application to the particular situation 

  

generally if the redemption does not meet the tests described above then the proceeds received by you from the redemption of your shares will be treated as a distribution taxable as a dividend to the extent of the allocable portion of current or accumulated earnings and profits if the redemption is taxed as a dividend your adjusted tax basis in the redeemed shares will be transferred to any other shareholdings in us that you own if you own no other shareholdings in us under certain circumstances such basis may be transferred to a related person or it may be lost entirely 

  

gain from the sale or exchange of our shares held for more than one year is generally taxed at a maximum longterm capital gain rate of 20 in the case of stockholders who are individuals and 35 in the case of stockholders that are corporations pursuant to internal revenue service guidance we may classify portions of our capital gain dividends as gains eligible for the longterm capital gains rate or as gain taxable to individual stockholders at a maximum rate of 25 capital losses recognized by a stockholder upon the disposition of our shares held for more than one year at the time of disposition will be considered longterm capital losses and are generally available only to offset capital gain income of the stockholder but not ordinary income except in the case of individuals who may offset up to 3000 of ordinary income each year 

  

an additional tax of 38 generally will be imposed on the “net investment income” of us stockholders who meet certain requirements and are individuals estates or certain trusts among other items “net investment income” generally includes gross income from dividends and net gain attributable to the disposition of certain property such as shares of our common stock or warrants in the case of individuals this tax will only apply to the extent such individual’s modified adjusted gross income exceeds 200000 250000 for married couples filing a joint return and surviving spouses and 125000 for married individuals filing a separate return us stockholders should consult their tax advisors regarding the possible applicability of this additional tax in their particular circumstances 

  

treatment of taxexempt us stockholders taxexempt entities including qualified employee pension and profit sharing trusts and individual retirement accounts “exempt organizations” generally are exempt from federal income taxation however they are subject to taxation on their unrelated business taxable income “ubti” the internal revenue service has issued a published revenue ruling that dividend distributions from a reit to an exempt employee pension trust do not constitute ubti provided that the shares of the reit are not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business of the exempt employee pension trust based on this ruling amounts distributed by us to exempt organizations generally should not constitute ubti however if an exempt organization finances its acquisition of the shares of our stock with debt a portion of its income from us will constitute ubti pursuant to the “debt financed property” rules likewise a portion of the exempt organization’s income from us would constitute ubti if we held a residual interest in a real estate mortgage investment conduit 

  

in addition in certain circumstances a pension trust that owns more than 10 of our stock is required to treat a percentage of our dividends as ubti this rule applies to a pension trust holding more than 10 of our stock only if 1 the percentage of our income that is ubti determined as if we were a pension trust is at least 5 2 we qualify as a reit by reason of the modification of the five or fewer requirement that allows beneficiaries of the pension trust to be treated as holding shares in proportion to their actuarial interests in the pension trust and 3 either i one pension trust owns more than 25 of the value of our stock or ii a group of pension trusts individually holding more than 10 of the value of our stock collectively own more than 50 of the value of our stock 

  

backup withholding and information reporting under certain circumstances you may be subject to backup withholding at applicable rates on payments made with respect to or cash proceeds of a sale or exchange of shares of our stock backup withholding will apply only if you 1 fail to provide a correct taxpayer identification number which if you are an individual is ordinarily your social security number 2 furnish an incorrect taxpayer identification number 3 are notified by the internal revenue service that you have failed to properly report payments of interest or dividends or 4 fail to certify under penalties of perjury that you have furnished a correct taxpayer identification number and that the internal revenue service has not notified you that you are subject to backup withholding 

  

backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients such as corporations and taxexempt organizations you should consult with a tax advisor regarding qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining an exemption backup withholding is not an additional tax rather the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a stockholder will be allowed as a credit against such stockholder’s united states federal income tax liability and may entitle such stockholder to a refund provided that the required information is provided to the internal revenue service in addition withholding a portion of capital gain distributions made to stockholders may be required for stockholders who fail to certify their nonforeign status

we will be required to withhold from distributions subject to firpta and remit to the internal revenue service 35 of designated capital gain dividends or if greater 35 of the amount of any distributions that could be designated as capital gain dividends in addition if we designate prior distributions as capital gain dividends subsequent distributions up to the amount of the prior distributions not withheld against will be treated as capital gain dividends for purposes of withholding 

  

any capital gain dividend with respect to any class of stock that is “regularly traded” on an established securities market will be treated as an ordinary dividend if the foreign stockholder did not own more than 10 of such class of stock at any time during the taxable year foreign stockholders generally will not be required to report distributions received from us on us federal income tax returns and all distributions treated as dividends for us federal income tax purposes including any such capital gain dividends will be subject to a 30 us withholding tax unless reduced under an applicable income tax treaty as discussed above in addition the branch profits tax will not apply to such distributions

  changes in applicable tax regulations could negatively affect our financial results 

  

  

the company is subject to taxation in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions because the us maintains a worldwide corporate tax system the foreign and us tax systems are somewhat interdependent longstanding international tax norms that determine each country’s jurisdiction to tax crossborder international trade are evolving such as the base erosion and profit shifting project “beps currently being undertaken by the g8 g20 and organization for economic cooperation and development tax changes pursuant to beps could reduce the ability of our foreign subsidiaries to deduct for foreign tax purposes the interest they pay on loans from the company thereby increasing the foreign tax liability of the subsidiaries it is also possible that foreign countries could increase their withholding taxes on dividends and interest given the unpredictability of these possible changes and their potential interdependency it is very difficult to assess the overall effect of such potential tax changes on our earnings and cash flow but such changes could adversely impact our financial results

 item 1a risk factors 

  

  this section discusses the most significant factors that affect our business operations and financial condition it does not describe all risks and uncertainties applicable to us our industry or ownership of our securities if any of the following risks as well as other risks and uncertainties that are not yet identified or that we currently think are not material actually occur we could be materially adversely affected in that event the value of our securities could decline 

  

  we group these risk factors into three categories 

  

•   risks arising from our business 

  

•   risks arising from our capital structure and 

  

•   risks arising from our status as a reit 

  

risks arising from our business 

  

our investments in and acquisitions of health care and seniors housing properties may be unsuccessful or fail to meet our expectations 

  

  we are exposed to the risk that some of our acquisitions may not prove to be successful we could encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired properties including contingent liabilities and acquired properties might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business if we agree to provide construction funding to an operatortenant and the project is not completed we may need to take steps to ensure completion of the project such expenditures may negatively affect our results of operations furthermore there can be no assurance that our anticipated acquisitions and investments the completion of which is subject to various conditions will be consummated in accordance with anticipated timing on anticipated terms or at all we also may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties into our existing operations and this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

our investments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by our lack of exclusive control over these investments our partners’ insolvency or failure to meet their obligations and disputes between us and our partners 

  

  we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into partnerships or joint ventures with other persons or entities joint venture investments involve risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership including the possibility that our partner might become insolvent refuse to make capital contributions when due or otherwise fail to meet its obligations which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments that our partner might at any time have economic or other business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our interests or goals that we could become engaged in a dispute with our partner which could require us to expend additional resources to resolve such dispute and could have an adverse impact on the operations and profitability of the joint venture and that our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests in addition our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted in some instances we andor our partner may have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partner’s interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction our ability to acquire our partner’s interest may be limited if we do not have sufficient cash available borrowing capacity or other capital resources in such event we may be forced to sell our interest in the joint venture when we would otherwise prefer to retain it joint ventures may require us to share decisionmaking authority with our partners which could limit our ability to control the properties in the joint ventures even when we have a controlling interest certain major decisions may require partner approval such as the sale acquisition or financing of a property 

  

we are exposed to operational risks with respect to our seniors housing operating properties that could adversely affect our revenue and operations 

  

  

  we are exposed to various operational risks with respect to our seniors housing operating properties that may increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to generate revenues these risks include fluctuations in occupancy medicare and medicaid reimbursement if applicable and private pay rates economic conditions competition federal state local and industryregulated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards the availability and increases in cost of general and professional liability insurance coverage state regulation and rights of residents related to entrance fees and the availability and increases in the cost of labor as a result of unionization or otherwise any one or a combination of these factors may adversely affect our revenue and operations 

  

decreases in our operators’ revenues or increases in our operators’ expenses could affect our operators’ ability to make payments to us 

  

  our operators’ revenues are primarily driven by occupancy private pay rates and medicare and medicaid reimbursement if applicable expenses for these facilities are primarily driven by the costs of labor food utilities taxes insurance and rent or debt service revenues from government reimbursement have and may continue to come under pressure due to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls operating costs continue to increase for our operators to the extent that any decrease in revenues andor any increase in operating expenses result in a property not generating enough cash to make payments to us the credit of our operator and the value of other collateral would have to be relied upon to the extent the value of such property is reduced we may need to record an impairment for such asset furthermore if we determine to dispose of an underperforming property such sale may result in a loss any such impairment or loss on sale would negatively affect our financial results 

  

increased competition may affect our operators’ ability to meet their obligations to us 

  

  the operators of our properties compete on a local and regional basis with operators of properties and other health care providers that provide comparable services we cannot be certain that the operators of all of our facilities will be able to achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us our operators are expected to encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to attract residents or expand their businesses 

  

a severe cold and flu season epidemics or any other widespread illnesses could adversely affect the occupancy of our seniors housing operating and triplenet properties 

  

  our and our operators’ revenues are dependent on occupancy it is impossible to predict the severity of the cold and flu season or the occurrence of epidemics or any other widespread illnesses the occupancy of our seniors housing operating and triplenet properties could significantly decrease in the event of a severe cold and flu season an epidemic or any other widespread illness such a decrease could affect the operating income of our seniors housing operating properties and the ability of our triplenet operators to make payments to us 

  

the insolvency or bankruptcy of our obligors may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

  we are exposed to the risk that our obligors may not be able to meet the rent principal and interest or other payments due us which may result in an obligor bankruptcy or insolvency or that an obligor might become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings for other reasons although our operating lease agreements provide us with the right to evict a tenant demand immediate payment of rent and exercise other remedies and our loans provide us with the right to terminate any funding obligation demand immediate repayment of principal and unpaid interest foreclose on the collateral and exercise other remedies the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization an obligor in bankruptcy or subject to insolvency proceedings may be able to limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent in the case of a lease or to receive unpaid principal and interest in the case of a loan and to exercise other rights and remedies 

  

  we may be required to fund certain expenses eg real estate taxes and maintenance to preserve the value of an investment property avoid the imposition of liens on a property andor transition a property to a new tenant in some instances we have terminated our lease with a tenant and relet the property to another tenant in some of those situations we have provided working capital loans to and limited indemnification of the new obligor if we cannot transition a leased property to a new tenant we may take possession of that property which may expose us to certain successor liabilities should such events occur our revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely affected 

  

we may not be able to timely reinvest our sale proceeds on terms acceptable to us 

  

  from time to time we will have cash available from 1 the proceeds of sales of our securities 2 principal payments on our loans receivable and 3 the sale of properties including nonelective dispositions under the terms of master leases or similar financial support arrangements in order to maintain current revenues and continue generating attractive returns we expect to reinvest these 

  

proceeds in a timely manner we compete for real estate investments with a broad variety of potential investors this competition for attractive investments may negatively affect our ability to make timely investments on terms acceptable to us 

  

failure to properly manage our rapid growth could distract our management or increase our expenses 

  

  we have experienced rapid growth and development in a relatively short period of time and expect to continue this rapid growth in the future this growth has resulted in increased levels of responsibility for our management future property acquisitions could place significant additional demands on and require us to expand our management resources and personnel our failure to manage any such rapid growth effectively could harm our business and in particular our financial condition results of operations and cash flows which could negatively affect our ability to make distributions to stockholders our growth could also increase our capital requirements which may require us to issue potentially dilutive equity securities and incur additional debt 

  

we depend on genesis healthcare llc “genesis” for a significant portion of our revenues and any inability or unwillingness by genesis to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us could adversely affect us 

  

  the properties we lease to genesis account for a significant portion of our revenues and because our leases with genesis are triplenet leases we also depend on genesis to pay all insurance taxes utilities and maintenance and repair expenses in connection with the leased properties we cannot assure you that genesis will have sufficient assets income and access to financing to enable it to make rental payments to us or to otherwise satisfy its obligations under our leases and any inability or unwillingness by genesis to do so could have an adverse effect on us genesis has also agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with its business and we cannot assure you that genesis will have sufficient assets income access to financing and insurance coverage to enable it to satisfy its indemnification obligations 

  

the properties managed by sunrise senior living llc account for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income and any adverse developments in its business or financial condition could adversely affect us 

  

  sunrise senior living llc manages our entire sunrise property portfolio which as of december 31 2015 consisted of 152 seniors housing properties these properties account for a significant portion of our revenues and we rely on sunrise senior living llc to manage these properties efficiently and effectively any adverse developments in sunrise senior living llc’s business or financial condition could impair its ability to manage our properties efficiently and effectively which could adversely affect us 

  

ownership of property outside the united states may subject us to different or greater risks than those associated with our domestic operations 

  

  we have operations in canada and the united kingdom international development ownership and operating activities involve risks that are different from those we face with respect to our domestic properties and operations these risks include but are not limited to any international currency gain recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates may not qualify under the 75 gross income test or the 95 gross income test that we must satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a reit challenges with respect to the repatriation of foreign earnings and cash changes in foreign political regulatory and economic conditions including regionally nationally and locally challenges in managing international operations challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations including those relating to real estate corporate governance operations taxes employment and legal proceedings foreign ownership restrictions with respect to operations in countries differences in lending practices and the willingness of domestic or foreign lenders to provide financing regional or countryspecific business cycles and economic instability and failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations in the united states that affect foreign operations including but not limited to the us foreign corrupt practices act if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with international expansion and operations our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

  

we do not know if our tenants will renew their existing leases and if they do not we may be unable to lease the properties on as favorable terms or at all 

  

  we cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases at the end of their lease terms which expire at various times if these leases are not renewed we would be required to find other tenants to occupy those properties or sell them there can be no assurance that we would be able to identify suitable replacement tenants or enter into leases with new tenants on terms as favorable to us as the current leases or that we would be able to lease those properties at all 

  

our operators’ may not have the necessary insurance coverage to insure adequately against losses 

  

  in recent years longtermpostacute care and seniors housing operators have experienced substantial increases in both the number and size of patient care liability claims as a result general and professional liability costs have increased in some markets general and professional liability insurance coverage may be restricted or very costly which may adversely affect the property operators’ 

  

future operations cash flows and financial condition and may have a material adverse effect on the property operators’ ability to meet their obligations to us 

  

our ownership of properties through ground leases exposes us to the loss of such properties upon breach or termination of the ground leases 

  

  we have acquired an interest in certain of our properties by acquiring a leasehold interest in the property on which the building is located and we may acquire additional properties in the future through the purchase of interests in ground leases as the lessee under a ground lease we are exposed to the possibility of losing the property upon termination of the ground lease or an earlier breach of the ground lease by us 

  

the requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid could have a material adverse effect on our obligors’ liquidity financial condition and results of operations which could adversely affect our obligors’ ability to meet their obligations to us 

  

  some of our obligors’ businesses are affected by government reimbursement to the extent that an operatortenant receives a significant portion of its revenues from government payors primarily medicare and medicaid such revenues may be subject to statutory and regulatory changes retroactive rate adjustments recovery of program overpayments or setoffs court decisions administrative rulings policy interpretations payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers government funding restrictions at a program level or with respect to specific facilities and interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing government investigations and audits at such property in recent years government payors have frozen or reduced payments to health care providers due to budgetary pressures health care reimbursement will likely continue to be of paramount importance to federal and state authorities we cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or effect any future legislative reforms may have on the financial condition of our obligors and properties there can be no assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will be available for services provided by any property operator whether the property receives reimbursement from medicare medicaid or private payors significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on an obligor’s liquidity financial condition and results of operations which could adversely affect the ability of an obligor to meet its obligations to us see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — united states — reimbursement” above 

  

  the patient protection and affordable care act of 2010 as modified by the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the “health reform laws” provides those states that expand their medicaid coverage to otherwise eligible state residents with incomes at or below 138 of the federal poverty level with an increased federal medical assistance percentage effective january 1 2014 when certain conditions are met on june 28 2012 the united states supreme court upheld the individual mandate of the health reform laws but partially invalidated the expansion of medicaid the ruling on medicaid expansion allows states to elect not to participate in the expansion—and to forego funding for the medicaid expansion—without losing their existing medicaid funding given that the federal government substantially funds the medicaid expansion it is unclear how many states will ultimately pursue this option although as of early february 2016 roughly half of the states have expanded medicaid coverage the participation by states in the medicaid expansion could have the dual effect of increasing our tenants’ revenues through new patients but further straining state budgets and their ability to pay our tenants while the federal government will pay for approximately 100 of those additional costs from 2014 through 2016 states will be expected to pay for part of those additional costs beginning in 2017 in light of this at least one state that has passed legislation to allow the state to expand its medicaid coverage has included sunset provisions in the legislation that require that the expanded benefits be reduced or eliminated if the federal government’s funding for the program is decreased or eliminated permitting the state to revisit the issue once it begins to share financial responsibility for the expansion with increasingly strained budgets it is unclear how states that do not include such sunset provisions will pay their share of these additional medicaid costs and what other health care expenditures could be reduced as a result a significant reduction in other health care related spending by states to pay for increased medicaid costs could affect our tenants’ revenue streams see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — united states — reimbursement” above 

  

  more generally and because of the dynamic nature of the legislative and regulatory environment for health care products and services and in light of existing federal deficit and budgetary concerns we cannot predict the impact that broadbased farreaching legislative or regulatory changes could have on the us economy our business or that of our operators and tenants 

  

our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with federal state local and industryregulated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards could adversely affect such operators’ or tenants’ operations which could adversely affect our operators’ and tenants’ ability to meet their obligations to us 

  

  our operators and tenants generally are subject to varying levels of federal state local and industryregulated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with any of these laws regulations or standards could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension decertification or exclusion from federal and state health care programs loss of license or closure of the facility such actions may have an effect on 

  

our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make lease payments to us and therefore adversely impact us see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — united states — other related laws initiatives and considerations” above 

  

  many of our properties may require a license registration andor certificate of need “con” to operate failure to obtain a license registration or con or loss of a required license registration or con would prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by the operators or tenants these events could materially adversely affect our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make rent payments to us state and local laws also may regulate the expansion including the addition of new beds or services or acquisition of medical equipment and the construction or renovation of health care facilities by requiring a con or other similar approval from a state agency see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — united states — licensing and certification” above 

  

illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties 

  

  real estate investments are relatively illiquid our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in economic and other conditions will be limited no assurances can be given that we will recognize full value for any property that we are required to sell for liquidity reasons our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition we are exposed to the risks inherent in concentrating investments in real estate and in particular the seniors housing and health care industries a downturn in the real estate industry could adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to sell properties for a price or on terms acceptable to us 

  

unfavorable resolution of pending and future litigation matters and disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

  

  from time to time we may be directly involved in a number of legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims we may also be named as defendants in lawsuits allegedly arising out of our actions or the actions of our operatorstenants or managers in which such operatorstenants or managers have agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses an unfavorable resolution of pending or future litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition regardless of its outcome litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of management there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail in or achieve a favorable settlement of pending or future litigation in addition pending litigation or future litigation government proceedings or environmental matters could lead to increased costs or interruption of our normal business operations 

  

development redevelopment and construction risks could affect our profitability 

  

  at any given time we may be in the process of constructing one or more new facilities that ultimately will require a con and license before they can be utilized by the operator for their intended use the operator also may need to obtain medicare and medicaid certification and enter into medicare and medicaid provider agreements andor third party payor contracts in the event that the operator is unable to obtain the necessary con licensure certification provider agreements or contracts after the completion of construction there is a risk that we will not be able to earn any revenues on the facility until either the initial operator obtains a license or certification to operate the new facility and the necessary provider agreements or contracts or we find and contract with a new operator that is able to obtain a license to operate the facility for its intended use and the necessary provider agreements or contracts 

  

  in connection with our renovation redevelopment development and related construction activities we may be unable to obtain or suffer delays in obtaining necessary zoning landuse building occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations these factors could result in increased costs or our abandonment of these projects in addition we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms which may render us unable to proceed with our development activities and we may not be able to complete construction and leaseup of a property on schedule which could result in increased debt service expense or construction costs 

  

  additionally the time frame required for development construction and leaseup of these properties means that we may have to wait years for significant cash returns because we are required to make cash distributions to our stockholders if the cash flow from operations or refinancing is not sufficient we may be forced to borrow additional money to fund such distributions newly developed and acquired properties may not produce the cash flow that we expect which could adversely affect our overall financial performance 

  

  in deciding whether to acquire or develop a particular property we make assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property in particular we estimate the return on our investment based on expected occupancy rental rates and capital costs if our financial projections with respect to a new property are inaccurate as a result of increases in capital costs or other factors the property may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment our estimate of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove to be inaccurate which may result in our failure to meet our profitability goals additionally we may 

  

acquire new properties that are not fully leased and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with that property 

  

we may experience losses caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters which could result in an increase of our or our tenants’ cost of insurance a decrease in our anticipated revenues or a significant loss of the capital we have invested in a property 

  

  we maintain or require our tenants to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties with terms conditions limits and deductibles that we believe are appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage and we continually review our insurance programs and requirements however a large number of our properties are located in areas particularly susceptible to revenue loss cost increase or damage caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters such as hurricanes earthquakes tornadoes and floods we believe given current industry practice and analysis prepared by outside consultants that our and our tenants’ insurance coverage is appropriate to cover reasonably anticipated losses that may be caused by hurricanes earthquakes tornadoes floods and other severe weather conditions and natural disasters nevertheless we are always subject to the risk that such insurance will not fully cover all losses and depending on the severity of the event and the impact on our properties such insurance may not cover a significant portion of the losses these losses may lead to an increase of our and our tenants’ cost of insurance a decrease in our anticipated revenues from an affected property and a loss of all or a portion of the capital we have invested in an affected property in addition we or our tenants may not purchase insurance under certain circumstances if the cost of insurance exceeds in our or our tenants’ judgment the value of the coverage relative to the risk of loss 

  

we may incur costs to remediate environmental contamination at our properties which could have an adverse effect on our or our obligors’ business or financial condition 

  

  under various federal and state laws owners or operators of real estate may be required to respond to the presence or release of hazardous substances on the property and may be held liable for property damage personal injuries or penalties that result from environmental contamination or exposure to hazardous substances we may become liable to reimburse the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination generally such liability attaches to a person based on the person’s relationship to the property our tenants or borrowers are primarily responsible for the condition of the property moreover we review environmental site assessments of the properties that we own or encumber prior to taking an interest in them those assessments are designed to meet the “all appropriate inquiry” standard which we believe qualifies us for the innocent purchaser defense if environmental liabilities arise based upon such assessments we do not believe that any of our properties are subject to material environmental contamination however environmental liabilities may be present in our properties and we may incur costs to remediate contamination which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition or the business or financial condition of our obligors 

  

cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our business and result in the loss of confidential information 

  

  our business is at risk from and may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential data and other electronic security breaches such cyber attacks can range from individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems to more sophisticated security threats while we employ a number of measures to prevent detect and mitigate these threats there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a cyber attack cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our business and compromise the confidential information of our employees operators and tenants 

  

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain antitakeover provisions 

  

  our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain antitakeover provisions restrictions on share ownership and transfer and super majority stockholder approval requirements for business combinations that could make it more difficult for or even prevent a third party from acquiring us without the approval of our incumbent board of directors provisions and agreements that inhibit or discourage takeover attempts could reduce the market value of our common stock 

  

our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed 

  

  we are dependent on key personnel although we have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers losing any one of them could at least temporarily have an adverse impact on our operations we believe that losing more than one could have a material adverse impact on our business 

  

risks arising from our capital structure 

  

we may become more leveraged 

  

  

  permanent financing for our investments is typically provided through a combination of public offerings of debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt the incurrence or assumption of indebtedness may cause us to become more leveraged which could 1 require us to dedicate a greater portion of our cash flow to the payment of debt service 2 make us more vulnerable to a downturn in the economy 3 limit our ability to obtain additional financing or 4 negatively affect our credit ratings or outlook by one or more of the rating agencies 

  

we are subject to covenants in our debt agreements that may restrict or limit our operations and acquisitions and our failure to comply with the covenants in our debt agreements could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

  our debt agreements contain various covenants restrictions and events of default among other things these provisions require us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness create liens and make investments or acquisitions breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness in addition to any other indebtedness crossdefaulted against such instruments these defaults could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to make future investments or to meet our obligations and commitments 

  

  we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the capital necessary to make future investments or to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature our access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control including rising interest rates inflation and other general market conditions the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions the market price of the shares of our capital stock and the credit ratings of our debt securities the financial stability of our lenders which might impair their ability to meet their commitments to us or their willingness to make additional loans to us changes in the credit ratings on us government debt securities or default or delay in payment by the united states of its obligations if our access to capital is limited by these factors or other factors it could negatively impact our ability to acquire properties repay or refinance our indebtedness fund operations or make distributions to our stockholders 

  

downgrades in our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital 

  

  we plan to manage the company to maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile but there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity andor financial condition 

  

fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

  

  as we expand our operations internationally currency exchange rate fluctuations could affect our results of operations and financial position we expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenue and expenses in such foreign currencies as the canadian dollar and the british pound although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions andor obtain local currency mortgage debt in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies we cannot assure you that foreign currency fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on us 

  

our entry into swap agreements may not effectively reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates 

  

  we enter into swap agreements from time to time to manage some of our exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate volatility these swap agreements involve risks such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements in addition these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates when we use forwardstarting interest rate swaps there is a risk that we will not complete the longterm borrowing against which the swap is intended to hedge if such events occur our results of operations may be adversely affected 

  

risks arising from our status as a reit 

  

we might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

  

  we intend to operate as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” and believe we have and will continue to operate in such a manner if we lose our status as a reit we will face serious income tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for satisfying our obligations and for distribution to our stockholders because 

  

  

•   we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rates 

•   we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes and 

•   unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions we could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified 

  

  since reit qualification requires us to meet a number of complex requirements it is possible that we may fail to fulfill them and if we do our earnings will be reduced by the amount of us federal and other income taxes owed a reduction in our earnings would affect the amount we could distribute to our stockholders if we do not qualify as a reit we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders since a nonreit is not required to pay dividends to stockholders in order to maintain reit status or avoid an excise tax see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations” above for a discussion of the provisions of the code that apply to us and the effects of failure to qualify as a reit 

  

  in addition if we fail to qualify as a reit all distributions to stockholders would continue to be treated as dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits although corporate stockholders may be eligible for the dividends received deduction and individual stockholders may be eligible for taxation at the rates generally applicable to longterm capital gains currently at a maximum rate of 20 with respect to distributions 

  

  as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to implement our business strategy and would adversely affect the value of our common stock 

  

  qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to remain qualified as a reit although we believe that we qualify as a reit we cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify or remain qualified as a reit for us federal income tax purposes see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations” above 

  

certain subsidiaries might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

  

  we own interests in a number of entities which have elected to be taxed as reits for federal income tax purposes some of which we consolidate for financial reporting purposes but each of which is treated as a separate reit for federal income tax purposes each a “subsidiary reit” to qualify as a reit each subsidiary reit must independently satisfy all of the reit qualification requirements under the code together with all other rules applicable to reits provided that each subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit our interests in the subsidiary reits will be treated as qualifying real estate assets for purposes of the reit asset tests see “item 1 – business – taxation – federal income tax considerations – qualification as a reit – asset tests” above if a subsidiary reit fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year such subsidiary reit will be subject to federal and state income taxes and may not be able to qualify as a reit for the four subsequent taxable years any such failure could have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reit income and asset tests and thus our ability to qualify as a reit unless we are able to avail ourselves of certain relief provisions 

  

the 90 annual distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions 

  

  to comply with the 90 distribution requirement applicable to reits and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax we must make distributions to our stockholders see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations — qualification as a reit — annual distribution requirements” above although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the reit distribution requirement it is possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90 distribution requirement or we may decide to retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation this may be due to timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses on the one hand and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income on the other hand in addition nondeductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of noncash deductions may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90 distribution requirement in the event that timing differences occur or we deem it appropriate to retain cash we may borrow funds issue additional equity securities although we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so pay taxable stock dividends if possible distribute other property or securities or engage in another transaction intended to enable us to meet the reit distribution requirements this may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations 

  

the lease of qualified health care properties to a taxable reit subsidiary is subject to special requirements 

  

  

  we lease certain qualified health care properties to taxable reit subsidiaries or limited liability companies of which the taxable reit subsidiaries are members which lessees contract with managers or related parties to manage the health care operations at these properties the rents from this taxable reit subsidiary lessee structure are treated as qualifying rents from real property if 1 they are paid pursuant to an armslength lease of a qualified health care property with a taxable reit subsidiary and 2 the manager qualifies as an eligible independent contractor as defined in the code if any of these conditions are not satisfied then the rents will not be qualifying rents see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations — qualification as a reit — income tests” above 

  

if certain saleleaseback transactions are not characterized by the internal revenue service as “true leases” we may be subject to adverse tax consequences 

  

  we have purchased certain properties and leased them back to the sellers of such properties and we may enter into similar transactions in the future we intend for any such saleleaseback transaction to be structured in such a manner that the lease will be characterized as a “true lease” thereby allowing us to be treated as the owner of the property for us federal income tax purposes however depending on the terms of any specific transaction the internal revenue service might take the position that the transaction is not a “true lease” but is more properly treated in some other manner in the event any saleleaseback transaction is challenged and successfully recharacterized by the internal revenue service we would not be entitled to claim the deductions for depreciation and cost recovery generally available to an owner of property furthermore if a saleleaseback transaction were so recharacterized we might fail to satisfy the reit asset tests or income tests and consequently could lose our reit status effective with the year of recharacterization see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations — qualification as a reit — asset tests” and “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations — qualification as a reit — income tests” above alternatively the amount of our reit taxable income could be recalculated which may cause us to fail to meet the reit annual distribution requirements for a taxable year see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations — qualification as a reit — annual distribution requirements” above

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  we are exposed to various market risks including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we seek to mitigate the underlying foreign currency exposures with gains and losses on derivative contracts hedging these exposures we seek to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates by matching the terms of new investments with new longterm fixed rate borrowings to the extent possible we may or may not elect to use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate exposure these decisions are principally based on our policy to match our variable rate investments with comparable borrowings but are also based on the general trend in interest rates at the applicable dates and our perception of the future volatility of interest rates this section is a discussion of the risks associated with potential fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates for additional information see “item 7 — management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — critical accounting policies” and notes 11 and 16 to our consolidated financial statements 

  we historically borrow on our primary unsecured credit facility to acquire construct or make loans relating to health care and seniors housing properties then as market conditions dictate we will issue equity or longterm fixed rate debt to repay the borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility we are subject to risks associated with debt financing including the risk that existing indebtedness may not be refinanced or that the terms of refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of current indebtedness the majority of our borrowings were completed under indentures or contractual agreements that limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur accordingly in the event that we are unable to raise additional equity or borrow money because of these limitations our ability to acquire additional properties may be limited 

  a change in interest rates will not affect the interest expense associated with our fixed rate debt interest rate changes however will affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt changes in the interest rate environment upon maturity of this fixed rate debt could have an effect on our future cash flows and earnings depending on whether the debt is replaced with other fixed rate debt variable rate debt or equity or repaid by the sale of assets to illustrate the impact of changes in the interest rate markets we performed a sensitivity analysis on our fixed rate debt instruments whereby we modeled the change in net present values arising from a hypothetical 1 increase in interest rates to determine the instruments’ change in fair value the following table summarizes the analysis performed as of the dates indicated in thousands 

  



  our variable rate debt including our unsecured line of credit arrangements is reflected at fair value at december 31 2015 we had 2236733000 outstanding related to our variable rate debt assuming no changes in outstanding balances a 1 increase in interest rates would result in increased annual interest expense of 22367000 at december 31 2014 we had 983783000 outstanding related to our variable rate debt assuming no changes in outstanding balances a 1 increase in interest rates would have resulted in increased annual interest expense of 9838000 

  we are subject to currency fluctuations that may from time to time affect our financial condition and results of operations increases or decreases in the value of the canadian dollar or pounds sterling relative to the us dollar impacts the amount of net income we earn from our investments in canada and the united kingdom based solely on our results for the twelve months ended december 31 2015 if these exchange rates were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points our net income from these investments would decrease or increase as applicable by less than 1000000 for the twelvemonth period we seek to mitigate these underlying foreign currency exposures with nonus denominated borrowings and gains and losses on derivative contracts hedging these exposures if we increase our international presence through investments in or acquisitions or development of seniors housing and health care properties outside the united states we may also decide to transact additional business or borrow funds in currencies other than the us dollar canadian dollars or pounds sterling to illustrate the impact of changes in foreign currency markets we performed a sensitivity analysis on our derivative portfolio whereby we modeled the change in net present values arising from a hypothetical 1 increase in foreign currency exchange rates to determine the instruments’ change in fair value the following table summarizes the results of the analysis performed excluding cross currency hedge activity dollars in thousands

management has assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2015 based on the criteria established by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 2013 framework in a report entitled internal control — integrated framework 

  

the scope of management’s assessment as of december 31 2015 did not include an assessment of the internal control over financial reporting for certain acquisitions because the business combinations occurred during the year ended december 31 2015 the acquired businesses represent 4 of total assets at december 31 2015 and less than 1 of revenues and net operating income for the year then ended the scope of management’s assessment on internal control over financial reporting for the year ended december 31 2016 will include the aforementioned acquired operations 

  

based on this assessment using the criteria above management concluded that the company’s system of internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2015

investments 

  

depending upon market conditions we believe that new investments will be available in the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to our stockholders we invest in seniors housing and health care real estate primarily through acquisitions developments and joint venture partnerships for additional information regarding acquisition and development activity please see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements we diversify our investment portfolio by property type relationship and geographic location in determining whether to invest in a property we focus on the following 1 the experience of the obligor’spartner’s management team 2 the historical and projected financial and operational performance of the property 3 the credit of the obligorpartner 4 the security for any lease or loan 5 the real estate attributes of the building and its location 6 the capital committed to the property by the obligorpartner and 7 the operating fundamentals of the applicable industry we conduct market research and analysis for all potential investments in addition we review the value of all properties the interest rates and covenant requirements of any facilitylevel debt to be assumed at the time of the acquisition and the anticipated sources of repayment of any existing debt that is not to be assumed at the time of the acquisition 

  

we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property our proactive and comprehensive asset management process for seniors housing properties generally includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each property review of obligorpartner creditworthiness property inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure real estate taxes letters of credit and other collateral our internal property management division actively manages and monitors the medical office building portfolio with a comprehensive process including review of among other things tenant relations lease expirations the mix of health service providers hospitalhealth system relationships property performance capital improvement needs and market conditions in monitoring our portfolio our personnel use a proprietary database to collect and analyze propertyspecific data additionally we conduct extensive research to ascertain industry trends 

  

we evaluate the operating environment in each property’s market to determine the likely trend in operating performance of the facility when we identify unacceptable trends we seek to mitigate eliminate or transfer the risk through these efforts we are generally able to intervene at an early stage to address any negative trends and in so doing support both the collectability of revenue and the value of our investment 

  

investment types 

  

real property our properties are primarily comprised of land buildings improvements and related rights our seniors housing triplenet properties are generally leased to operators under longterm operating leases the leases generally have a fixed contractual term of 12 to 15 years and contain one or more five to 15year renewal options certain of our leases also contain purchase options a portion of which could result in the disposition of properties for less than full market value most of our rents are received under triplenet leases requiring the operator to pay rent and all additional charges incurred in the operation of the leased property the tenants are required to repair rebuild and maintain the leased properties substantially all of these operating leases are designed with escalating rent structures leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straightline basis over the initial lease period subject to a collectability assessment rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period 

  

at december 31 2014 approximately 89 of our seniors housing triplenet properties were subject to master leases a master lease is a lease of multiple properties to one tenant entity under a single lease agreement from time to time we may acquire additional properties that are then leased to the tenant under the master lease the tenant is required to make one monthly payment that represents rent on all the properties that are subject to the master lease typically the master lease tenant can exercise its right to purchase the properties or to renew the master lease only with respect to all leased properties at the same time this bundling feature benefits us because the tenant cannot limit the purchase or renewal to the better performing properties and terminate the leasing 

  

arrangement with respect to the poorer performing properties this spreads our risk among the entire group of properties within the master lease the bundling feature should provide a similar advantage to us if the master lease tenant is in bankruptcy subject to certain restrictions a debtor in bankruptcy has the right to assume or reject each of its leases it is our intent that a tenant in bankruptcy would be required to assume or reject the master lease as a whole rather than deciding on a property by property basis 

  

our medical office building portfolio is primarily selfmanaged and consists principally of multitenant properties leased to health care providers our leases typically include increasers and some form of operating expense reimbursement by the tenant as of december 31 2014 85 of our portfolio included leases with full pass through 13 with a partial expense reimbursement modified gross and 2 with no expense reimbursement gross our medical office building leases are noncancellable operating leases that have a weightedaverage remaining term of eight years at december 31 2014 and are often credit enhanced by security deposits guaranties andor letters of credit 

  

construction we occasionally provide for the construction of properties for tenants as part of longterm operating leases we capitalize certain interest costs associated with funds used for the construction of properties owned by us the amount capitalized is based upon the amount advanced during the construction period using the rate of interest that approximates our companywide cost of financing our interest expense is reduced by the amount capitalized we also typically charge a transaction fee at the commencement of construction which we defer and amortize to income over the term of the resulting lease the construction period commences upon funding and terminates upon the earlier of the completion of the applicable property or the end of a specified period during the construction period we advance funds to the tenants in accordance with agreed upon terms and conditions which require among other things periodic site visits by a company representative during the construction period we generally require an additional credit enhancement in the form of payment and performance bonds andor completion guaranties at december 31 2014 we had outstanding construction investments of 186327000 and were committed to provide additional funds of approximately 227618000 to complete construction for investment properties 

  

real estate loans our real estate loans are typically structured to provide us with interest income principal amortization and transaction fees and are generally secured by firstsecond mortgage liens leasehold mortgages corporate guaranties andor personal guaranties at december 31 2014 we had outstanding real estate loans of 380169000 the interest yield averaged approximately 82 per annum on our outstanding real estate loan balances our yield on real estate loans depends upon a number of factors including the stated interest rate average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments the real estate loans outstanding at december 31 2014 are generally subject to one to 15year terms with principal amortization schedules andor balloon payments of the outstanding principal balances at the end of the term typically real estate loans are crossdefaulted and crosscollateralized with other real estate loans operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its affiliates 

  

  investments in unconsolidated entities  our investments in unconsolidated entities generally represent interests ranging from 10 to 50 in real estate assets investments in less than majority owned entities are reported under the equity method of accounting when our interests represent either 1 general partnership interests subject to substantive participating or kickout rights that have been granted to the limited partners or 2 limited partnership interests with no control over major operating and financial policies of the entities under the equity method of accounting our share of the investee’s earnings or losses is included in our consolidated results of operations to the extent that our cost basis is different from the basis reflected at the entity level the basis difference is generally amortized over the lives of the related assets and liabilities and such amortization is included in our share of equity in earnings of the entity the initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated entities is based on the amount paid to purchase the entity interest or the estimated fair value of the assets prior to the sale of interests in the entity we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the equity method investment to its carrying value when we determine a decline in the estimated fair value of such an investment below its carrying value is otherthantemporary an impairment is recorded see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for more information 

  

principles of consolidation 

  

the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our whollyowned subsidiaries and joint venture entities that we control through voting rights or other means all material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation 

  

at inception of joint venture transactions we identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights “variable interest entities” or “vies” and determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of its operations a vie is broadly defined as an entity where either i the equity investors as a group if any do not have a controlling financial interest or ii the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support we consolidate investments in vies when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary accounting standards codification topic 810 consolidations  requires enterprises to perform a qualitative approach to determining whether or not a vie will need to be consolidated on a continuous basis this evaluation is based on an enterprise’s ability to direct and influence the activities of a vie that most significantly impact that entity’s economic performance 

  

  

for investments in joint ventures we evaluate the type of rights held by the limited partners which may preclude consolidation in circumstances in which the sole general partner would otherwise consolidate the limited partnership the assessment of limited partners’ rights and their impact on the presumption of control over a limited partnership by the sole general partner should be made when an investor becomes the sole general partner and should be reassessed if i there is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights of the limited partners ii the sole general partner increases or decreases its ownership in the limited partnership interests or iii there is an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding limited partnership interests we similarly evaluate the rights of managing members of limited liability companies 

  

borrowing policies 

  

we utilize a combination of debt and equity to fund investments our debt and equity levels are determined by management to maintain a conservative credit profile generally we intend to issue unsecured fixedrate public debt with longterm maturities to approximate the maturities on our triplenet leases and loans for shortterm purposes we may borrow on our primary unsecured credit facility we replace these borrowings with longterm capital such as senior unsecured notes common stock or preferred stock when terms are deemed favorable we may invest in properties subject to existing mortgage indebtedness in addition we may obtain secured financing for unleveraged properties in which we have invested or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis in certain agreements with our lenders we are subject to restrictions with respect to secured and unsecured indebtedness 

  

competition 

  

we compete with other real estate investment trusts real estate partnerships private equity and hedge fund investors banks insurance companies financeinvestment companies governmentsponsored agencies taxable and taxexempt bond funds health care operators developers and other investors in the acquisition development leasing and financing of health care and seniors housing properties we compete for investments based on a number of factors including relationships certainty of execution investment structures and underwriting criteria our ability to successfully compete is impacted by economic and demographic trends availability of acceptable investment opportunities our ability to negotiate beneficial investment terms availability and cost of capital construction and renovation costs and applicable laws and regulations 

  

the operatorstenants of our properties compete with properties that provide comparable services in the local markets operatorstenants compete for patients and residents based on a number of factors including quality of care reputation physical appearance of properties location services offered family preferences physicians staff and price we also face competition from other health care facilities for tenants such as physicians and other health care providers that provide comparable facilities and services

health care industry 

  

the demand for health care services and consequently health care properties is projected to reach unprecedented levels in the near future the centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” projects that national health expenditures will rise to approximately 34 trillion in 2016 or 177 of gross domestic product “gdp” the average annual growth in national health expenditures for 2013 through 2023 is expected to be 57 

  

  while demographics are the primary driver of demand economic conditions and availability of services contribute to health care service utilization rates we believe the health care property market may be less susceptible to fluctuations and economic downturns relative to other property sectors investor interest in the market remains strong especially in specific sectors such as privatepay senior living and medical office buildings 

  

  the total us population is projected to increase by 134 through 2033 the elderly population aged 65 and over is projected to increase by 683 through 2033 the elderly are an important component of health care utilization especially independent living services assisted living services longtermpostacute care services inpatient and outpatient hospital services and physician ambulatory care most health care services are provided within a health care facility such as a hospital a physician’s office or a seniors housing community therefore we believe there will be continued demand for companies such as ours with expertise in health care real estate 

  

  

health care real estate investment opportunities tend to increase as demand for health care services increases we recognize the need for health care real estate as it correlates to health care service demand health care providers require real estate to house their businesses and expand their services we believe that investment opportunities in health care real estate will continue to be present due to 

·   the specialized nature of the industry which enhances the credibility and experience of our company 

·   the projected population growth combined with stable or increasing health care utilization rates which ensures demand and 

·   the ongoing merger and acquisition activity 

  

certain government regulations 

  

united states 

  

health law matters — generally 

  

  typically operators of seniors housing facilities do not receive significant funding from government programs and are largely subject to state laws as opposed to federal laws operators of longtermpostacute care facilities and hospitals do receive significant funding from government programs and these facilities are subject to the federal and state laws that regulate the type and quality of the medical andor nursing care provided ancillary services eg respiratory occupational physical and infusion therapies qualifications of the administrative personnel and nursing staff the adequacy of the physical plant and equipment reimbursement and rate setting and operating policies in addition as described below operators of these facilities are subject to extensive laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including but not limited to the federal antikickback statute the federal stark law and the federal false claims act as well as comparable state law counterparts hospitals physician group practice clinics and other health care providers that operate in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal state and local licensure registration certification and inspection laws regulations and industry standards our tenants’ failure to comply with any of these and other laws could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension decertification or exclusion from federal and state health care programs loss of license or closure of the facility 

  

licensing and certification 

  

  the primary regulations that affect seniors housing facilities with assisted living are state licensing and registration laws in granting and renewing these licenses the state regulatory agencies consider numerous factors relating to a property’s physical plant and operations including but not limited to admission and discharge standards staffing and training a decision to grant or renew a license is also affected by a property owner’s record with respect to patient and consumer rights medication guidelines and rules certain of the seniors housing facilities mortgaged to or owned by us may require the resident to pay an entrance or upfront fee a portion of which may be refundable these entrance fee communities are subject to significant state regulatory oversight including for example oversight of each facility’s financial condition establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial restrictions the right of residents to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time lien rights in favor of residents restrictions on change of ownership and similar matters such oversight and the rights of residents within these entrance fee communities may have an effect on the revenue or operations of the operators of such facilities and therefore may adversely affect us 

  

  certain health care facilities are subject to a variety of licensure and certificate of need “con” laws and regulations where applicable con laws generally require among other requirements that a facility demonstrate the need for 1 constructing a new facility 2 adding beds or expanding an existing facility 3 investing in major capital equipment or adding new services 4 changing the ownership or control of an existing licensed facility or 5 terminating services that have been previously approved through the con process certain state con laws and regulations may restrict the ability of operators to add new properties or expand an existing facility’s size or services in addition con laws may constrain the ability of an operator to transfer responsibility for operating a particular facility to a new operator if we have to replace a property operator who is excluded from participating in a federal or state health care program as discussed below our ability to replace the operator may be affected by a particular state’s con laws regulations and applicable guidance governing changes in provider control 

  

  with respect to licensure generally our longtermpostacute care facilities and acute care facilities are required to be licensed and certified for participation in medicare medicaid and other federal health care programs this generally requires license renewals and compliance surveys on an annual or biannual basis the failure of our operators to maintain or renew any required license or regulatory approval as well as the failure of our operators to correct serious deficiencies identified in a compliance survey could require those operators to discontinue operations at a property in addition if a property is found to be out of compliance with medicare medicaid or other health care program conditions of participation the property operator may be excluded from participating in those government health care programs any such occurrence may impair an operator’s ability to meet their financial 

  

obligations to us if we have to replace an excludedproperty operator our ability to replace the operator may be affected by federal and state laws regulations and applicable guidance governing changes in provider control this may result in payment delays an inability to find a replacement operator a significant working capital commitment from us to a new operator or other difficulties 

  

reimbursement 

  

  the reimbursement methodologies applied to health care facilities continue to evolve federal and state authorities have considered and may seek to implement new or modified reimbursement methodologies that may negatively impact health care property operations the impact of any such changes if implemented may result in a material adverse effect on our portfolio no assurance can be given that current revenue sources or levels will be maintained accordingly there can be no assurance that payments under a government health care program are currently or will be in the future sufficient to fully reimburse the property operators for their operating and capital expenses as a result an operator’s ability to meet its financial obligations to us could be adversely impacted 

  

  seniors housing facilities excluding longtermpostacute care facilities approximately 58 of our overall revenues including discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2014 were attributable to us seniors housing facilities the majority of the revenues received by the operators of these facilities are from private pay sources the remaining revenue source is primarily medicaid under certain waiver programs as a part of the omnibus budget reconciliation act “obra” of 1981 congress established a waiver program enabling some states to offer medicaid reimbursement to assisted living providers as an alternative to institutional longterm care services the provisions of obra and the subsequent obra acts of 1987 and 1990 permit states to seek a waiver from typical medicaid requirements to develop costeffective alternatives to longterm care including medicaid payments for assisted living and home health as of september 30 2014 14 of our 38 seniors housing operators received medicaid reimbursement pursuant to medicaid waiver programs for the twelve months ended september 30 2014 approximately 2 of the revenues at our seniors housing facilities were from medicaid reimbursement there can be no guarantee that a state medicaid program operating pursuant to a waiver will be able to maintain its waiver status 

  

  rates paid by selfpay residents are set by the facilities and are determined by local market conditions and operating costs generally facilities receive a higher payment per day for a private pay resident than for a medicaid beneficiary who requires a comparable level of care the level of medicaid reimbursement varies from state to state thus the revenues generated by operators of our assisted living facilities may be adversely affected by payor mix acuity level changes in medicaid eligibility and reimbursement levels in addition a state could lose its medicaid waiver and no longer be permitted to utilize medicaid dollars to reimburse for assisted living services changes in revenues could in turn have a material adverse effect on an operator’s ability to meet its obligations to us 

  

  longtermpostacute care facilities  approximately 13 of our overall revenues including discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2014 were attributable to longtermpostacute care facilities the majority of the revenues received by the operators of these facilities are from the medicare and medicaid programs with the balance representing reimbursement payments from private payors including private insurers consequently changes in federal or state reimbursement policies may adversely affect an operator’s ability to cover its expenses including our rent or debt service longtermpostacute care facilities are subject to periodic pre and postpayment reviews and other audits by federal and state authorities a review or audit of a property operator’s claims could result in recoupments denials or delay of payments in the future which could have a material adverse effect on the operator’s ability to meet its financial obligations to us due to the significant judgments and estimates inherent in payor settlement accounting no assurance can be given as to the adequacy of any reserves maintained by our property operators to cover potential adjustments to reimbursements or to cover settlements made to payors recent attention on billing practices payments and quality of care or ongoing government pressure to reduce spending by government health care programs could result in lower payments to longtermpostacute care facilities and as a result may impair an operator’s ability to meet its financial obligations to us 

  

  medicare reimbursement and longtermpostacute care facilities for the twelve months ended september 30 2014 approximately 34 of the revenues at our longtermpostacute care facilities were paid by medicare generally longtermpostacute care facilities are reimbursed under the medicare skilled nursing facility prospective payment system “snf pps” the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system “irf pps” or the long term care hospital prospective payment system “ltch pps” there is a risk under these payment systems that costs will exceed the fixed payments or that payments may be set below the costs to provide certain items and services which could result in immediate financial difficulties for operators and could cause operators to seek bankruptcy protection 

  

  the centers for medicare  medicaid services “cms” an agency of hhs made positive payment updates for the 2015 fiscal year under the snf pss the irf pps and the ltch pps 

·   on august 5 2014 cms issued a final rule for the snf pps under the final rule skilled nursing facilities “snfs” will receive a net rate increase of 20 accounting for adjustments such as the multifactor productivity adjustment cms estimates aggregate payments to snfs will increase by 750 million in fiscal year 2015 

  

·   on august 6 2014 cms issued a final rule for the irf pps under the final rule inpatient rehabilitation facilities “irfs” will receive a net rate increase of 22 accounting for adjustments such as the multifactor productivity adjustment cms estimates aggregate payments to irfs will increase by 180 million in fiscal year 2015 

·   on august 22 2014 cms issued a final rule for the ltch pps under the final rule longterm care hospitals “ltchs” will receive a net rate increase of 09 accounting for adjustments including but not limited to a multifactor productivity adjustment and the phasein of a budget neutrality adjustment including other changes cms estimates aggregate payments to ltchs will increase by 62 million in fiscal year 2015 

  

  on december 26 2014 the president signed into law the pathway for sgr reform act “sgr reform” sgr reform implemented several changes to the medicare payment rules for ltchs for a discharge in cost reporting periods beginning on or after october 1 2015 specified cases in ltchs will receive the “applicable” siteneutral payment rate specifically payment rates will be blended for discharges in cost reporting periods beginning in fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2017 consisting of half of the site neutral payment rate and half of the payment rate that would otherwise apply and then shift to all siteneutral payments in fiscal year 2018 patients with a threeday stay in an intensive care unit “icu” prior to ltch admission or ventilator patients with at least 96 hours are exempted from the lower siteneutral payments if the discharge does not have a principal diagnosis relating to a psychiatric diagnosis or to rehabilitation beginning in fiscal year 2020 ltchs are to maintain at least 50 of patients that are excluded from the siteneutral payments sgr reform also requires the medicare payment advisory committee “medpac” to conduct a study and submit a report to congress by june 30 2019 that includes recommendations that address these changes to the ltch payment policies additionally beginning in fiscal year 2016 calculation of length of stay requirements for ltchs will exclude any patients for whom payment is made i at the siteneutral payment rate and ii under any medicare advantage plan sgr reform also delayed implementation of a limit of no more than 25 of patients referred from any one hospital “25 rule” for another three years and the secretary of hhs must issue a report in two years on the need for any further extension or modifications to the 25 rule finally sgr reform reinstituted a moratorium on new ltchs or any increase in ltch beds from january 1 2015 through september 30 2017 

  

  on october 6 2014 the president signed into law the improving medicare postacute transformation act of 2014 “impact act” the law applies to snfs ltchs irfs and home health agencies and requires providers to report standardized patient assessment data data on quality measures and data on resource use and other measures the law requires public reporting of quality and resource use and other measures medpac is required to submit a report to congress by june 30 2016 evaluating and recommending features of a postacute payment system that establishes payment rates according to individual characteristics instead of the postacute setting where the patient is treated the report must include a technical prototype for a postacute prospective payment system and the impact of moving from the current to the new payment system 

  

  on april 1 2014 the protecting access to medicare act of 2014 “access to medicare act” was enacted the access to medicare act implements valuebased purchasing for snfs beginning in fiscal year 2019 2 of snf payments will be withheld and approximately 50 to 70 of the amount withheld will be paid to snfs through valuebased payments snfs will begin reporting a readmissions rate measure by october 1 2015 and a resource use measure by october 1 2016 both measures will be publicly available by october 1 2017 

  

  medicare reimbursement and physicians   cms annually adjusts the medicare physician fee schedule payment rates based on an update formula that includes application of the sustainable growth rate “sgr” on november 13 2014 cms published the calendar year 2015 physician fee schedule final rule which called for a negative 212 update under the statutory sgr formula the budget act and access to medicare act avoided until march 31 2015 the reimbursement cuts that would have occurred congress has overridden the required reduction every year since 2003 the final rule continues implementation of quality and cost measures that will be used in establishing a new value−based modifier that would adjust physician payments based on whether they are providing higher quality and more efficient care the health reform laws as defined below require cms to begin making payment adjustments to certain physicians and physician groups on january 1 2015 and to apply the modifier to all physicians by january 1 2017 calendar year 2013 is the initial performance year for purposes of adjusting payments in calendar year 2015 

  

  medicaid reimbursement and longtermpostacute care facilities   for the twelve months ended september 30 2014 approximately 42 of the revenues of longtermpostacute care facilities were paid by medicaid the federal and state governments share responsibility for financing medicaid the federal matching rate known as the federal medical assistance percentage “fmap” varies by state based on relative per capita income but is at least 50 in all states medicaid is the largest component of total state spending representing approximately 258 of total state expenditures in state fiscal year 2014 the percentage of medicaid dollars for longtermpostacute care facilities varies from state to state due in part to different ratios of elderly population and eligibility requirements within certain federal guidelines states have a fairly wide range of discretion to determine eligibility and reimbursement methodology many states reimburse snfs for example using fixed daily rates which are applied prospectively based on patient acuity and the historical costs incurred in providing patient care reasonable costs typically include allowances for staffing administrative and general expenses property and equipment eg real estate taxes depreciation and fair rental 

  

  

  in most states medicaid does not fully reimburse the cost of providing services certain states are attempting to slow the rate of medicaid growth by freezing rates or restricting eligibility and benefits average medicaid rates for our longtermpostacute care facilities will likely vary throughout the year as states continue to make interim changes to their budgets and medicaid funding in addition medicaid reimbursement rates may decline if revenues in a particular state are not sufficient to fund budgeted expenditures 

  

  health reform laws on march 23 2010 the president signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act of 2010 the “ppaca” and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 which amends the ppaca collectively the “health reform laws” the health reform laws contain various provisions that may directly impact us or the operators and tenants of our properties some provisions of the health reform laws may have a positive impact on our operators’ or tenants’ revenues by for example increasing coverage of uninsured individuals while others may have a negative impact on the reimbursement of our operators or tenants by for example altering the market basket adjustments for certain types of health care facilities the health reform laws also enhance certain fraud and abuse penalty provisions that could apply to our operators and tenants in the event of one or more violations of the federal health care regulatory laws in addition there are provisions that impact the health coverage that we and our operators and tenants provide to our respective employees the health reform laws also provide additional medicaid funding to allow states to carry out the expansion of medicaid coverage to certain financially−eligible individuals beginning in 2014 and have also permitted states to expand their medicaid coverage to these individuals since april 1 2010 if certain conditions are met on june 28 2012 the united states supreme court upheld the individual mandate of the health reform laws but partially invalidated the expansion of medicaid the ruling on medicaid expansion will allow states not to participate in the expansion – and to forego funding for the medicaid expansion – without losing their existing medicaid funding given that the federal government substantially funds the medicaid expansion it is unclear how many states will ultimately pursue this option the participation by states in the medicaid expansion could have the dual effect of increasing our tenants’ revenues through new patients but could also further strain state budgets while the federal government will pay for approximately 100 of those additional costs from 2014 to 2016 states will be expected to pay for part of those additional costs beginning in 2017 

  

  we cannot predict whether the existing health reform laws or future health care reform legislation or regulatory changes will have a material impact on our operators’ or tenants’ property or business if the operations cash flows or financial condition of our operators and tenants are materially adversely impacted by the health reform laws or future legislation our revenue and operations may be adversely affected as well 

  

other related laws 

  

  longtermpostacute care facilities and seniors housing facilities that receive medicaid payments are subject to federal state and local laws regulations and applicable guidance that govern the operations and financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by health care providers certain of these laws prohibit direct or indirect payments of any kind for the purpose of inducing or encouraging the referral of patients for medical products or services reimbursable by government health care programs other laws require providers to furnish only medically necessary services and submit to the government valid and accurate statements for each service still other laws require providers to comply with a variety of safety health and other requirements relating to the condition of the licensed property and the quality of care provided sanctions for violations of these laws regulations and other applicable guidance may include but are not limited to criminal andor civil penalties and fines loss of licensure immediate termination of government payments and exclusion from any government health care program in certain circumstances violation of these rules such as those prohibiting abusive and fraudulent behavior with respect to one property may subject other facilities under common control or ownership to sanctions including exclusion from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs as well as other government health care programs in the ordinary course of its business a property operator is regularly subjected to inquiries investigations and audits by the federal and state agencies that oversee these laws and regulations 

  

  longtermpostacute care facilities and seniors housing facilities that receive medicaid payments are also subject to the federal antikickback statute which generally prohibits persons from offering providing soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing of a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal health care program such as medicare or medicaid longtermpostacute care facilities are also subject to the federal ethics in patient referral act of 1989 commonly referred to as the stark law the stark law generally prohibits the submission of claims to medicare for payment if the claim results from a physician referral for certain designated services and the physician has a financial relationship with the health service provider that does not qualify under one of the exceptions for a financial relationship under the stark law similar prohibitions on physician selfreferrals and submission of claims apply to state medicaid programs further longtermpostacute care facilities and seniors housing facilities that receive medicaid payments are subject to substantial financial penalties under the civil monetary penalties act and the federal false claims act and in particular actions under the federal false claims act’s “whistleblower” provisions private enforcement of health care fraud has increased due in large part to amendments to the federal false claims act that encourage private individuals to sue on behalf of the government these whistleblower suits brought by private individuals known as qui tam actions may be filed by almost anyone including present and former patients nurses and other employees significantly if a claim is successfully adjudicated the federal false claims act provides for treble damages up to 11000 per claim 

  

  

  prosecutions investigations or whistleblower actions could have a material adverse effect on a property operator’s liquidity financial condition and operations which could adversely affect the ability of the operator to meet its financial obligations to us finally various state false claim act and antikickback laws may also apply to each property operator violation of any of the foregoing statutes can result in criminal andor civil penalties that could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its financial obligations to us 

  

  other legislative developments including the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” have greatly expanded the definition of health care fraud and related offenses and broadened its scope to include private health care plans in addition to government payors congress also has greatly increased funding for the department of justice federal bureau of investigation and the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services to audit investigate and prosecute suspected health care fraud moreover a significant portion of the billions in health care fraud recoveries over the past several years has also been returned to government agencies to further fund their fraud investigation and prosecution efforts 

  

  additionally other hipaa provisions and regulations provide for communication of health information through standard electronic transaction formats and for the privacy and security of health information in order to comply with the regulations health care providers often must undertake significant operational and technical implementation efforts operators also may face significant financial exposure if they fail to maintain the privacy and security of medical records and other personal health information about individuals the health information technology for economic and clinical health “hitech” act passed in february 2009 strengthened the hhs secretary’s authority to impose civil money penalties for hipaa violations occurring after february 18 2009 hitech directs the hhs secretary to provide for periodic audits to ensure covered entities and their business associates as that term is defined under hipaa comply with the applicable hitech requirements increasing the likelihood that a hipaa violation will result in an enforcement action cms issued an interim final rule which conformed hipaa enforcement regulations to the hitech act increasing the maximum penalty for multiple violations of a single requirement or prohibition to 15 million higher penalties may accrue for violations of multiple requirements or prohibitions additionally on january 17 2013 cms released a final rule which expands the applicability of hipaa and hitech and strengthens the government’s ability to enforce these laws the final rule broadens the definition of “business associate” and provides for civil money penalty liability against covered entities and business associates for the acts of their agents regardless of whether a business associate agreement is in place this rule also modified the standard for when a breach of unsecured personally identifiable health information must be reported some covered entities have entered into settlement agreements with hhs for allegedly failing to adopt policies and procedures sufficient to implement the breach notification provisions in the hitech act additionally the final rule adopts certain changes to the hipaa enforcement regulations to incorporate the increased and tiered civil monetary penalty structure provided by hitech and makes business associates of covered entities directly liable under hipaa for compliance with certain of the hipaa privacy standards and hipaa security standards hipaa violations are also potentially subject to criminal penalties 

  

  in november 2002 cms began an ongoing national nursing home quality initiative “nhqi” under this initiative historical survey information the nhqi pilot evaluation report and the nhqi overview is made available to the public online the nhqi website provides consumer and provider information regarding the quality of care in nursing homes the data allows consumers providers states and researchers to compare quality information that shows how well nursing homes are caring for their residents’ physical and clinical needs the posted nursing home quality measures come from resident assessment data that nursing homes routinely collect on the residents at specified intervals during their stay if the operators of nursing facilities are unable to achieve quality of care ratings that are comparable or superior to those of their competitors they may lose market share to other facilities reducing their revenues and adversely impacting their ability to make rental payments 

  

  finally government investigations and enforcement actions brought against the health care industry have increased dramatically over the past several years and are expected to continue some of these enforcement actions represent novel legal theories and expansions in the application of the federal false claims act the costs for an operator of a health care property associated with both defending such enforcement actions and the undertakings in settling these actions can be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its obligations to us

from april 1 2015 the 2010 regulations will be fully revoked by the 2014 regulations the 2014 regulations aim to streamline the legal obligations in the 2010 regulations and replace them with a set of more broadlyphrased legally binding “fundamental standards” largely based on existing obligations in the 2010 regulations 

  

while the obligations listed above will continue to exist in line with the new “fundamental standards” the 2014 regulations introduce a number of changes including 

  

·   a new “duty of candour” to notify and apologize to affected persons in the event of certain incidents having actually or potentially led to the death of the service user where the death relates directly to the incident rather than to the natural course of the service users illness or underlying condition or severe harm moderate harm or prolonged psychological harm to the service user note that this requirement came into force on november 27 2014 and 

·   more detailed standards to be met by individuals to be eligible to act as a director of a service provider institution for instance the individual should not have been responsible for been privy to contributed to or facilitated any serious misconduct or mismanagement whether unlawful or not in the course of carrying on a regulated activity or equivalent outside of england note that this requirement came into force on november 27 2014

·   any event which prevents or appears to the service provider to be likely to threaten to prevent the service provider’s ability to continue to carry on the regulated activity safely or in accordance with the registration requirements 

  

failure to comply with the above notification obligations is an offense and a person guilty of an offense is liable on summary conviction to a fine of up to £2500 the amount of this fine will be increased to £10000 by a statutory instrument once coming into force 

  

regulatory oversight and inspections 

  

the act also sets out the powers and responsibilities of the cqc among other powers the cqc administers the compulsory registration system and issues guidance to care service providers on how to comply with applicable standards set out in legislation 

  

the cqc is also empowered to carry out inspections of care home premises to verify compliance with the standards set out in legislation the cqc’s current policy is to carry out routine unannounced inspections at care homes at least once a year reports of all inspections in england are published as are details of enforcement actions taken by the cqc which can include issuing warning notices restricting the services that the provider can offer stopping admissions into the care service issuing fixed penalty notices suspending or cancelling the service registration and prosecution 

  

the care act 2014 sets out certain provisions which are not yet in force concerning among others 

·   the duty of a local authority to meet the needs of an adult for care and support and a carer’s needs where the registered care provider is unable to carry on a regulated activity because of business failure 

·   the duty of the cqc to assess the financial sustainability of providers subject to its regulatory regime with a view to identifying any threats that such providers may face to their financial sustainability where the cqc identifies a significant risk to financial sustainability it can require the provider to develop a sustainability plan setting out the provider’s plan to mitigate or eliminate risk or require the provider to organize an independent review of the business with the costs being recovered from the provider and 

·   a new offense where certain registered care providers supply publish or make available information that is false or misleading in a material respect 

  

financial assistance for service users 

  

financial assistance for service users towards care home fees is available from local authorities and is meanstested the national health service may also in certain circumstances contribute towards the costs of nursing care 

  

privacy 

  

in the european union “eu” data protection is governed by the eu data protection directive 9546ec the “data protection directive” the data protection directive has been implemented in the uk by the data protection act 1998 the “act” which entered into force on march 2000 and is enforced by the information commissioner’s office “ico” 

  

the act applies to a data controller that processes personal data in the context of an establishment in the uk or where not established in the uk in any other state of the european economic area “eea” processes personal data through equipment located in the uk other than for the purposes of transit through the uk under the act a data controller is the person who either alone or jointly or in common with other persons determines the purposes for which and the manner in which any personal data are or are to be processed personal data is widely defined as data which relates to a living individual who can be identified from those data or from those data and other information which is in the possession of or is likely to come into the possession of the data controller sensitive personal data is personal data consisting of information as to the racial or ethnic origin of the data subject hisher political opinions religious beliefs or other beliefs of a similar nature whether heshe is a member of a trade union hisher physical or mental health or condition hisher sexual life and the commission or alleged commission by himher of an offense any proceedings for any 

  

offense committed or alleged to have been committed by himher the disposal of such proceedings or the sentence of any court in such proceedings 

  

  the act imposes a number of obligations on the data controller contained in eight data protection principles i personal data must be processed fairly and lawfully ii personal data must be processed for specified and lawful purposes iii personal data must be adequate relevant and not excessive iv personal data must be accurate and up to date v personal data must not be kept for longer than necessary vi personal data must be processed in accordance with the rights of data subjects vii appropriate technical and organizational measures shall be taken against unauthorized or unlawful processing of personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of or damage to personal data and viii there is a prohibition on transfers of personal data to countries outside the eea that are not deemed by the european commission to provide an adequate level of protection which includes the us unless certain exemptions under the act apply 

  

  the ico has a number of enforcement powers available which includes in certain limited cases criminal prosecution and noncriminal enforcement and audits in case of a breach of the act the ico may i provide practical advice to organizations on how they should handle data protection matters ii issue undertakings committing an organization to a particular course of action in order to improve its compliance iii serve enforcement notices where there has been a breach requiring organizations to take or refrain from taking specified steps in order to ensure they comply with the law iv conduct consensual assessments audits to determine if organizations are complying v serve assessment notices to conduct compulsory audits to assess whether organizations’ processing of personal data follows good data protection practices vi issue monetary penalty notices requiring organizations to pay up to £500000 for serious breaches of the act occurring on or after april 6 2010 or serious breaches of the privacy and electronic communications regulations occurring after may 26 2011 and vii prosecute those who commit criminal offenses under the act under the act individuals also have the right to claim compensation from an organization in respect of damage caused by a breach of any of the requirements of the act 

  

there is a proposal for an eu data protection regulation which would replace the data protection directive and impose a significant number of new obligations including among others a requirement to appoint data protection officers having detailed documentation on the processing of personal data carrying out privacy impact assessments in certain circumstances providing standardized data protection notices reporting security breaches without undue delay and providing certain rights to individuals such as a right of erasure of personal data the eu data protection regulation is to have significant enforcement powers with fines proposed by the european commission of up 2 of annual worldwide turnover and with fines proposed by the european parliament of up to 5 of annual worldwide turnover or €100 million whichever is greater the eu data protection regulation may be adopted sometime in 2015 with eu member states possibly having two years to implement the regulation

  other related laws 

  

  privacy 

  

  the services provided in our facilities are generally subject to privacy legislation in canada including in certain provinces privacy laws specifically related to personal health information although the obligations of custodians of personal health information in the various provinces differ to some extent they all include the obligation to protect the information the organizations with which we have management agreements may be the custodian of personal health informationpersonal information collected in connection with the operation of our facilities 

  

  privacy laws in canada are consentbased and require the implementation of a privacy program involving policies procedures and the designation of an individual or team with primary responsibility for a custodian’s privacy law compliance mandatory breach notification is a requirement under some laws some laws require notification where personal health informationpersonal information is processed or stored outside of canada one provincial law in quebec provides for fines where an organization fails to perform required due diligence before outsourcing activities involving personal information to a service provider outside of the province 

  

  some privacy regulators in canada have ordermaking authority and others are ombudspersons who make recommendations that may only be enforced by a court under a number of privacy laws a finding by a regulator that a custodian has breached the law creates a right to apply to a court for money damages in some provinces there is a statutory civil cause of action for breach of privacy in other provinces the courts have recognized a limited common law cause of action for breach of privacy 

  

  the powers of privacy regulators and penalties for violations of privacy law vary according to the applicable law or are left to the courts to date penalties have generally not been monetary although that may change depending on decisions in connection with class actions regulators have the authority to make public the identity of a health information custodian that has been found to have committed a breach so that there is a reputational risk associated with privacy law violations even where no monetary damages are incurred the notification of patients mandatory under some privacy laws and other activities required to manage a privacy breach can give rise to significant costs 

  

  other legislation 

  

  retirement homes may be subject to residential tenancy laws such that there can be restrictions on rent increases and termination of tenancies for instance other provincial legislation applicable to occupational health and safety public health and the provision of community health care and funded longtermpostacute care may also apply to retirement homes in addition municipal laws with respect to matters such as fire safety food services and zoning would also apply

general 

  

we elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust a “reit” commencing with our first taxable year we intend to continue to operate in such a manner as to qualify as a reit but there is no guarantee that we will qualify or remain qualified as a reit for subsequent years qualification and taxation as a reit depends upon our ability to meet a variety of qualification tests imposed under federal income tax law with respect to income assets distribution level and diversity of share ownership as discussed below under “— qualification as a reit” there can be no assurance that we will be owned and organized and will operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified 

  

in any year in which we qualify as a reit in general we will not be subject to federal income tax on that portion of our reit taxable income or capital gain that is distributed to stockholders we may however be subject to tax at normal corporate rates on any taxable income or capital gain not distributed if we elect to retain and pay income tax on our net longterm capital gains stockholders are required to include their proportionate share of our undistributed longterm capital gains in income but they will receive a refundable credit for their share of any taxes paid by us on such gain 

  

despite the reit election we may be subject to federal income and excise tax as follows 

  

• to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our “reit taxable income” as adjusted we will be subject to tax on the undistributed amount at regular corporate tax rates 

  

• we may be subject to the “alternative minimum tax” the “amt” on certain tax preference items to the extent that the amt exceeds our regular tax 

  

• if we have net income from the sale or other disposition of “foreclosure property” that is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business or other nonqualifying income from foreclosure property such income will be taxed at the highest corporate rate 

  

• any net income from prohibited transactions which are in general sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business other than dispositions of foreclosure property and dispositions of property due to an involuntary conversion will be subject to a 100 tax 

  

• if we fail to satisfy either the 75 or 95 gross income tests as discussed below but nonetheless maintain our qualification as a reit because certain other requirements are met we will be subject to a 100 tax on an amount equal to 1 the gross income attributable to the greater of i 75 of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75 gross income test discussed below or ii 95 of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 95 gross income test discussed below multiplied by 2 a fraction intended to reflect our profitability 

  

• if we fail to distribute during each year at least the sum of 1 85 of our reit ordinary income for the year 2 95 of our reit capital gain net income for such year other than capital gain that we elect to retain and pay tax on and 3 any undistributed taxable income from preceding periods we will be subject to a 4 excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over amounts actually distributed 

  

• we will be subject to a 100 tax on the amount of any rents from real property deductions or excess interest paid to us by any of our “taxable reit subsidiaries” that would be reduced through reallocation under certain federal income tax principles in 

  

order to more clearly reflect income of the taxable reit subsidiary see “— qualification as a reit — investments in taxable reit subsidiaries” and 

  

• we may be subject to the corporate “alternative minimum tax” on any items of tax preference including any deductions of net operating losses 

  

if we acquire any assets from a corporation which is or has been a “c” corporation in a carryover basis transaction we could be liable for specified liabilities that are inherited from the “c” corporation a “c” corporation is generally defined as a corporation that is required to pay full corporate level federal income tax if we recognize gain on the disposition of the assets during the tenyear period beginning on the date on which the assets were acquired by us then to the extent of the assets’ “builtin gain” ie the excess of the fair market value of the asset over the adjusted tax basis in the asset in each case determined as of the beginning of the tenyear period we will be subject to tax on the gain at the highest regular corporate rate applicable the results described in this paragraph with respect to the recognition of builtin gain assume that the builtin gain assets at the time the builtin gain assets were subject to a conversion transaction either where a “c” corporation elected reit status or a reit acquired the assets from a “c” corporation were not treated as sold to an unrelated party and gain recognized for those properties that are subject to the builtingains tax if triggered by a sale within the tenyear period beginning on the date on which the properties were acquired by us then the potential amount of builtingains tax will be an additional factor when considering a possible sale of the properties see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the builtin gains tax 

  

qualification as a reit 

  

a reit is defined as a corporation trust or association 

  

1 which is managed by one or more trustees or directors 

  

2 the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest 

  

3 which would be taxable as a domestic corporation but for the federal income tax law relating to reits 

  

4 which is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company 

  

5 the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons in each taxable year of the reit except for its first taxable year 

  

6 not more than 50 in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned during the last half of each taxable year excluding its first taxable year directly or indirectly by or for five or fewer individuals which includes certain entities the “five or fewer requirement” and 

  

7 which meets certain income and asset tests described below 

  

conditions 1 to 4 inclusive must be met during the entire taxable year and condition 5 must be met during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months for purposes of conditions 5 and 6 pension funds and certain other taxexempt entities are treated as individuals subject to a “lookthrough” exception in the case of condition 6 

  

based on publicly available information we believe we have satisfied the share ownership requirements set forth in 5 and 6 above in addition article vi of our bylaws provides for restrictions regarding ownership and transfer of shares these restrictions are intended to assist us in continuing to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in 5 and 6 above these restrictions however may not ensure that we will in all cases be able to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in 5 and 6 above 

  

we have complied with and will continue to comply with regulatory rules to send annual letters to certain of our stockholders requesting information regarding the actual ownership of our stock if despite sending the annual letters we do not know or after exercising reasonable diligence would not have known whether we failed to meet the five or fewer requirement we will be treated as having met the five or fewer requirement if we fail to comply with these regulatory rules we will be subject to a monetary penalty if our failure to comply was due to intentional disregard of the requirement the penalty would be increased however if our failure to comply were due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect no penalty would be imposed 

  

we may own a number of properties through wholly owned subsidiaries a corporation will qualify as a “qualified reit subsidiary” if 100 of its stock is owned by a reit and the reit does not elect to treat the subsidiary as a taxable reit subsidiary 

  

a “qualified reit subsidiary” will not be treated as a separate corporation and all assets liabilities and items of income deductions and credits of a “qualified reit subsidiary” will be treated as assets liabilities and items as the case may be of the reit a “qualified reit subsidiary” is not subject to federal income tax and our ownership of the voting stock of a qualified reit subsidiary will not violate the restrictions against ownership of securities of any one issuer which constitute more than 10 of the value or total voting power of such issuer or more than 5 of the value of our total assets as described below under “— asset tests” 

  

if we invest in a partnership a limited liability company or a trust taxed as a partnership or as a disregarded entity we will be deemed to own a proportionate share of the partnership’s limited liability company’s or trust’s assets likewise we will be treated as receiving our share of the income and loss of the partnership limited liability company or trust and the gross income will retain the same character in our hands as it has in the hands of the partnership limited liability company or trust these “lookthrough” rules apply for purposes of the income tests and assets tests described below 

  

income tests there are two separate percentage tests relating to our sources of gross income that we must satisfy for each taxable year 

  

• at least 75 of our gross income excluding gross income from certain sales of property held primarily for sale must be directly or indirectly derived each taxable year from “rents from real property” other income from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property or certain income from qualified temporary investments 

  

• at least 95 of our gross income excluding gross income from certain sales of property held primarily for sale must be directly or indirectly derived each taxable year from any of the sources qualifying for the 75 gross income test and from dividends including dividends from taxable reit subsidiaries and interest 

  

as to transactions entered into in taxable years beginning after october 22 2004 and on or prior to july 30 2008 any of our income from a “clearly identified” hedging transaction that is entered into by us in the normal course of business directly or indirectly to manage the risk of interest rate movements price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings or obligations incurred or to be incurred by us or such other risks that are prescribed by the internal revenue service is excluded from the 95 gross income test 

  

for transactions entered into after july 30 2008 any of our income from a “clearly identified” hedging transaction that is entered into by us in the normal course of business directly or indirectly to manage the risk of interest rate movements price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings or obligations incurred or to be incurred by us is excluded from the 95 and 75 gross income tests 

  

for transactions entered into after july 30 2008 any of our income from a “clearly identified” hedging transaction entered into by us primarily to manage risk of currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain that is included in gross income in the 95 and 75 gross income tests is excluded from the 95 and 75 gross income tests 

  

in general a hedging transaction is “clearly identified” if 1 the transaction is identified as a hedging transaction before the end of the day on which it is entered into and 2 the items or risks being hedged are identified “substantially contemporaneously” with the hedging transaction an identification is not substantially contemporaneous if it is made more than 35 days after entering into the hedging transaction 

  

as to gains and items of income recognized after july 30 2008 “passive foreign exchange gain” for any taxable year will not constitute gross income for purposes of the 95 gross income test and “real estate foreign exchange gain” for any taxable year will not constitute gross income for purposes of the 75 gross income test real estate foreign exchange gain is foreign currency gain as defined in internal revenue code section 988b1 which is attributable to i any qualifying item of income or gain for purposes of the 75 gross income test ii the acquisition or ownership of obligations secured by mortgages on real property or interests in real property or iii becoming or being the obligor under obligations secured by mortgages on real property or on interests in real property real estate foreign exchange gain also includes internal revenue code section 987 gain attributable to a qualified business unit a “qbu” of a reit if the qbu itself meets the 75 gross income test for the taxable year and the 75 asset test at the close of each quarter that the reit has directly or indirectly held the qbu real estate foreign exchange gain also includes any other foreign currency gain as determined by the secretary of the treasury passive foreign exchange gain includes all real estate foreign exchange gain and foreign currency gain which is attributable to i any qualifying item of income or gain for purposes of the 95 gross income test ii the acquisition or ownership of obligations iii becoming or being the obligor under obligations and iv any other foreign currency gain as determined by the secretary of the treasury 

  

generally other than income from “clearly identified” hedging transactions entered into by us in the normal course of business any foreign currency gain derived by us from dealing or engaging in substantial and regular trading in securities will constitute gross income which does not qualify under the 95 or 75 gross income tests 

  

  

rents received by us will qualify as “rents from real property” for purposes of satisfying the gross income tests for a reit only if several conditions are met 

  

• the amount of rent must not be based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person although rents generally will not be excluded merely because they are based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales 

  

• rents received from a tenant will not qualify as rents from real property if the reit or an owner of 10 or more of the reit also directly or constructively owns 10 or more of the tenant unless the tenant is our taxable reit subsidiary and certain other requirements are met with respect to the real property being rented 

  

• if rent attributable to personal property leased in connection with a lease of real property is greater than 15 of the total rent received under the lease then the portion of rent attributable to such personal property will not qualify as “rents from real property” 

  

• for rents to qualify as rents from real property we generally must not furnish or render services to tenants other than through a taxable reit subsidiary or an “independent contractor” from whom we derive no income except that we may directly provide services that are “usually or customarily rendered” in the geographic area in which the property is located in connection with the rental of real property for occupancy only or are not otherwise considered “rendered to the occupant for his convenience” 

  

• for taxable years beginning after july 30 2008 the reit may lease “ qualified health care properties” on an arm’slength basis to a taxable reit subsidiary if the property is operated on behalf of such subsidiary by a person who qualifies as an “independent contractor” and who is or is related to a person who is actively engaged in the trade or business of operating health care facilities for any person unrelated to us or our taxable reit subsidiary an “ eligible independent contractor  ” generally the rent that the reit receives from the taxable reit subsidiary will be treated as “rents from real property”   a “qualified health care property” includes any real property and any personal property that is or is necessary or incidental to the use of a hospital nursing facility assisted living facility congregate care facility qualified continuing care facility or other licensed facility that extends medical or nursing or ancillary services to patients and is operated by a provider of such services that is eligible for participation in the medicare program with respect to such facility 

  

a reit is permitted to render a de minimis amount of impermissible services to tenants and still treat amounts received with respect to that property as rent from real property the amount received or accrued by the reit during the taxable year for the impermissible services with respect to a property may not exceed 1 of all amounts received or accrued by the reit directly or indirectly from the property the amount received for any service or management operation for this purpose shall be deemed to be not less than 150 of the direct cost of the reit in furnishing or rendering the service or providing the management or operation furthermore impermissible services may be furnished to tenants by a taxable reit subsidiary subject to certain conditions and we may still treat rents received with respect to the property as rent from real property 

  

the term “interest” generally does not include any amount if the determination of the amount depends in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person although an amount generally will not be excluded from the term “interest” solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage of receipts or sales 

  

if we fail to satisfy one or both of the 75 or 95 gross income tests for any taxable year we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for such year if we are eligible for relief these relief provisions generally will be available if 1 following our identification of the failure we file a schedule for such taxable year describing each item of our gross income and 2 the failure to meet such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect 

  

it is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions if these relief provisions apply a 100 tax is imposed on an amount equal to a the gross income attributable to 1 75 of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75 income test and 2 95 of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 95 income test multiplied by b a fraction intended to reflect our profitability 

  

the secretary of the treasury is given broad authority to determine whether particular items of income or gain qualify or not under the 75 and 95 gross income tests or are to be excluded from the measure of gross income for such purposes 

  

asset tests within 30 days after the close of each quarter of our taxable year we must also satisfy several tests relating to the nature and diversification of our assets determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles at least 75 of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets cash cash items including receivables arising in the ordinary course of our operation government securities and qualified temporary investments although the remaining 25 of our assets generally may be invested without restriction we are prohibited from owning securities representing more than 10 of either the vote the 

  

“10 vote test” or value the “10 value test” of the outstanding securities of any issuer other than a qualified reit subsidiary another reit or a taxable reit subsidiary further no more than 25 of the total assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries the “25 asset test” and no more than 5 of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities of any nongovernmental issuer other than a qualified reit subsidiary the “5 asset test” another reit or a taxable reit subsidiary each of the 10 vote test the 10 value test and the 25 and 5 asset tests must be satisfied at the end of each quarter there are special rules which provide relief if the value related tests are not satisfied due to changes in the value of the assets of a reit 

  

certain items are excluded from the 10 value test including 1 straight debt securities as defined in internal revenue code section 1361c5 of an issuer including straight debt that provides certain contingent payments 2 any loan to an individual or an estate 3 any rental agreement described in section 467 of the internal revenue code other than with a “related person” 4 any obligation to pay rents from real property 5 certain securities issued by a state or any subdivision thereof the district of columbia a foreign government or any political subdivision thereof or the commonwealth of puerto rico 6 any security issued by a reit and 7 any other arrangement that as determined by the secretary of the treasury is excepted from the definition of security “excluded securities” special rules apply to straight debt securities issued by corporations and entities taxable as partnerships for federal income tax purposes if a reit or its taxable reit subsidiary holds 1 straight debt securities of a corporate or partnership issuer and 2 securities of such issuer that are not excluded securities and have an aggregate value greater than 1 of such issuer’s outstanding securities the straight debt securities will be included in the 10 value test 

  

a reit’s interest as a partner in a partnership is not treated as a security for purposes of applying the 10 value test to securities issued by the partnership further any debt instrument issued by a partnership will not be a security for purposes of applying the 10 value test 1 to the extent of the reit’s interest as a partner in the partnership and 2 if at least 75 of the partnership’s gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions would qualify for the 75 gross income test for purposes of the 10 value test a reit’s interest in a partnership’s assets is determined by the reit’s proportionate interest in any securities issued by the partnership other than the excluded securities described in the preceding paragraph 

  

for taxable years beginning after july 30 2008 if the reit or its qbu uses a foreign currency as its functional currency the term “cash” includes such foreign currency but only to the extent such foreign currency is i held for use in the normal course of the activities of the reit or qbu which give rise to items of income or gain that are included in the 95 and 75 gross income tests or are directly related to acquiring or holding assets qualifying under the 75 asset test and ii not held in connection with dealing or engaging in substantial and regular trading in securities 

  

with respect to corrections of failures as to violations of the 10 vote test the 10 value test or the 5 asset test a reit may avoid disqualification as a reit by disposing of sufficient assets to cure a violation that does not exceed the lesser of 1 of the reit’s assets at the end of the relevant quarter or 10000000 provided that the disposition occurs within six months following the last day of the quarter in which the reit first identified the assets for violations of any of the reit asset tests due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that exceed the thresholds described in the preceding sentence a reit can avoid disqualification as a reit after the close of a taxable quarter by taking certain steps including disposition of sufficient assets within the six month period described above to meet the applicable asset test paying a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets during the period of time that the assets were held as nonqualifying assets and filing a schedule with the internal revenue service that describes the nonqualifying assets 

  

investments in taxable reit subsidiaries   reits may own more than 10 of the voting power and value of securities in taxable reit subsidiaries we and any taxable corporate entity in which we own an interest are allowed to jointly elect to treat such entity as a “taxable reit subsidiary” 

  

certain of our subsidiaries have elected to be treated as a taxable reit subsidiary taxable reit subsidiaries are subject to full corporate level federal taxation on their earnings but are permitted to engage in certain types of activities that cannot be performed directly by reits without jeopardizing their reit status our taxable reit subsidiaries will attempt to minimize the amount of these taxes but there can be no assurance whether or the extent to which measures taken to minimize taxes will be successful to the extent our taxable reit subsidiaries are required to pay federal state or local taxes the cash available for distribution as dividends to us from our taxable reit subsidiaries will be reduced 

  

the amount of interest on relatedparty debt that a taxable reit subsidiary may deduct is limited further a 100 tax applies to any interest payments by a taxable reit subsidiary to its affiliated reit to the extent the interest rate is not commercially reasonable a taxable reit subsidiary is permitted to deduct interest payments to unrelated parties without any of these restrictions 

  

the internal revenue service may reallocate costs between a reit and its taxable reit subsidiary where there is a lack of arm’slength dealing between the parties any deductible expenses allocated away from a taxable reit subsidiary would increase its tax liability further any amount by which a reit understates its deductions and overstates those of its taxable reit subsidiary may subject to certain exceptions be subject to a 100 tax additional taxable reit subsidiary elections may be made in the future for additional entities in which we obtain an interest 

  

  

annual distribution requirements in order to avoid being taxed as a regular corporation we are required to make distributions other than capital gain distributions to our stockholders which qualify for the dividends paid deduction in an amount at least equal to 1 the sum of i 90 of our “reit taxable income” computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain and ii 90 of the aftertax net income if any from foreclosure property minus 2 a portion of certain items of noncash income these distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for that year and if paid on or before the first regular distribution payment after such declaration the amount distributed must not be preferential this means that every stockholder of the class of stock to which a distribution is made must be treated the same as every other stockholder of that class and no class of stock may be treated otherwise than in accordance with its dividend rights as a class to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our “reit taxable income” as adjusted we will be subject to tax on the undistributed amount at regular corporate tax rates as discussed above we may be subject to an excise tax if we fail to meet certain other distribution requirements we believe we have satisfied the annual distribution requirements for the year of our initial reit election and each year thereafter through the year ended december 31 2014 although we intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy these annual distribution requirements for subsequent years economic market legal tax or other factors could limit our ability to meet those requirements see “item 1a — risk factors” 

  

it is also possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90 distribution requirement or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation due to among other things 1 timing differences between i the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses and ii the inclusion of income and deduction of expenses in arriving at our taxable income or 2 the payment of severance benefits that may not be deductible to us in the event that timing differences occur we may find it necessary to arrange for borrowings or if possible pay dividends in the form of taxable stock dividends in order to meet the distribution requirement 

  

under certain circumstances in the event of a deficiency determined by the internal revenue service we may be able to rectify a resulting failure to meet the distribution requirement for a year by paying “deficiency dividends” to stockholders in a later year which may be included in our deduction for distributions paid for the earlier year thus we may be able to avoid being taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends however we will be required to pay applicable penalties and interest based upon the amount of any deduction taken for deficiency dividend distributions 

  

  failure to qualify as a reit 

  

if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates distributions to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify as a reit will not be deductible nor will any particular amount of distributions be required to be made in any year all distributions to stockholders will be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these distributions and subject to certain limitations will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporate stockholders unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions we also will be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to statutory relief failure to qualify for even one year could result in our need to incur indebtedness or liquidate investments in order to pay potentially significant resulting tax liabilities 

  

in addition to the relief described above under “— income tests” and “— asset tests” relief is available in the event that we violate a provision of the internal revenue code that would result in our failure to qualify as a reit if 1 the violation is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect 2 we pay a penalty of 50000 for each failure to satisfy the provision and 3 the violation does not include a violation described under “— income tests” or “— asset tests” above it is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions 

  

federal income taxation of holders of our stock 

  

treatment of taxable us stockholders the following summary applies to you only if you are a “us stockholder” a “us stockholder” is a holder of shares of stock who for united states federal income tax purposes is 

  

• a citizen or resident of the united states 

  

• a corporation partnership or other entity classified as a corporation or partnership for these purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the united states or of any political subdivision of the united states including any state 

  

• an estate the income of which is subject to united states federal income taxation regardless of its source or 

  

• a trust if in general a us court is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or more us persons within the meaning of the internal revenue code has the authority to control all of the trust’s substantial 

  

decisions 

  

so long as we qualify for taxation as a reit distributions on shares of our stock made out of the current or accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these distributions and not designated as capital gain dividends will be includable as ordinary income for federal income tax purposes none of these distributions will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for us corporate stockholders 

  

generally the current maximum marginal rate of tax payable by individuals on dividends received from corporations that are subject to a corporate level of tax is 20 except in limited circumstances this tax rate will not apply to dividends paid to you by us on our shares because generally we are not subject to federal income tax on the portion of our reit taxable income or capital gains distributed to our stockholders the reduced maximum federal income tax rate will apply to that portion if any of dividends received by you with respect to our shares that are attributable to 1 dividends received by us from nonreit corporations or other taxable reit subsidiaries 2 income from the prior year with respect to which we were required to pay federal corporate income tax during the prior year if for example we did not distribute 100 of our reit taxable income for the prior year or 3 the amount of any earnings and profits that were distributed by us and accumulated in a nonreit year 

  

distributions that are designated as capital gain dividends will be taxed as longterm capital gains to the extent they do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year without regard to the period for which you held our stock however if you are a corporation you may be required to treat a portion of some capital gain dividends as ordinary income 

  

if we elect to retain and pay income tax on any net longterm capital gain you would include in income as longterm capital gain your proportionate share of this net longterm capital gain you would also receive a refundable tax credit for your proportionate share of the tax paid by us on such retained capital gains and you would have an increase in the basis of your shares of our stock in an amount equal to your includable capital gains less your share of the tax deemed paid 

  

you may not include in your federal income tax return any of our net operating losses or capital losses federal income tax rules may also require that certain minimum tax adjustments and preferences be apportioned to you in addition any distribution declared by us in october november or december of any year on a specified date in any such month shall be treated as both paid by us and received by you on december 31 of that year provided that the distribution is actually paid by us no later than january 31 of the following year 

  

we will be treated as having sufficient earnings and profits to treat as a dividend any distribution up to the amount required to be distributed in order to avoid imposition of the 4 excise tax discussed under “— general” and “— qualification as a reit — annual distribution requirements” above as a result you may be required to treat as taxable dividends certain distributions that would otherwise result in a taxfree return of capital moreover any “deficiency dividend” will be treated as a dividend an ordinary dividend or a capital gain dividend as the case may be regardless of our earnings and profits any other distributions in excess of current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to you to the extent these distributions do not exceed the adjusted tax basis of your shares of our stock you will be required to reduce the tax basis of your shares of our stock by the amount of these distributions until the basis has been reduced to zero after which these distributions will be taxable as capital gain if the shares of our stock are held as capital assets the tax basis as so reduced will be used in computing the capital gain or loss if any realized upon sale of the shares of our stock any loss upon a sale or exchange of shares of our stock which were held for six months or less after application of certain holding period rules will generally be treated as a longterm capital loss to the extent you previously received capital gain distributions with respect to these shares of our stock 

  

upon the sale or exchange of any shares of our stock to or with a person other than us or a sale or exchange of all shares of our stock whether actually or constructively owned with us you will generally recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your adjusted tax basis in these shares of our stock this gain will be capital gain if you held these shares of our stock as a capital asset 

  

if we redeem any of your shares in us the treatment can only be determined on the basis of particular facts at the time of redemption in general you will recognize gain or loss as opposed to dividend income equal to the difference between the amount received by you in the redemption and your adjusted tax basis in your shares redeemed if such redemption 1 results in a “complete termination” of your interest in all classes of our equity securities 2 is a “substantially disproportionate redemption” or 3 is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” with respect to you in applying these tests you must take into account your ownership of all classes of our equity securities eg common stock preferred stock depositary shares and warrants you also must take into account any equity securities that are considered to be constructively owned by you 

  

if as a result of a redemption by us of your shares you no longer own either actually or constructively any of our equity securities or only own actually and constructively an insubstantial percentage of our equity securities then it is probable that the redemption of your shares would be considered “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” and thus would result in gain or loss to you however 

  

whether a distribution is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” depends on all of the facts and circumstances and if you rely on any of these tests at the time of redemption you should consult your tax advisor to determine their application to the particular situation 

  

generally if the redemption does not meet the tests described above then the proceeds received by you from the redemption of your shares will be treated as a distribution taxable as a dividend to the extent of the allocable portion of current or accumulated earnings and profits if the redemption is taxed as a dividend your adjusted tax basis in the redeemed shares will be transferred to any other shareholdings in us that you own if you own no other shareholdings in us under certain circumstances such basis may be transferred to a related person or it may be lost entirely 

  

gain from the sale or exchange of our shares held for more than one year is generally taxed at a maximum longterm capital gain rate of 20 in the case of stockholders who are individuals and 35 in the case of stockholders that are corporations pursuant to internal revenue service guidance we may classify portions of our capital gain dividends as gains eligible for the longterm capital gains rate or as gain taxable to individual stockholders at a maximum rate of 25 capital losses recognized by a stockholder upon the disposition of our shares held for more than one year at the time of disposition will be considered longterm capital losses and are generally available only to offset capital gain income of the stockholder but not ordinary income except in the case of individuals who may offset up to 3000 of ordinary income each year 

  

an additional tax of 38 generally will be imposed on the “net investment income” of us stockholders who meet certain requirements and are individuals estates or certain trusts among other items “net investment income” generally includes gross income from dividends and net gain attributable to the disposition of certain property such as shares of our common stock or warrants in the case of individuals this tax will only apply to the extent such individual’s modified adjusted gross income exceeds 200000 250000 for married couples filing a joint return and surviving spouses and 125000 for married individuals filing a separate return us stockholders should consult their tax advisors regarding the possible applicability of this additional tax in their particular circumstances 

  

treatment of taxexempt us stockholders taxexempt entities including qualified employee pension and profit sharing trusts and individual retirement accounts “exempt organizations” generally are exempt from federal income taxation however they are subject to taxation on their unrelated business taxable income “ubti” the internal revenue service has issued a published revenue ruling that dividend distributions from a reit to an exempt employee pension trust do not constitute ubti provided that the shares of the reit are not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business of the exempt employee pension trust based on this ruling amounts distributed by us to exempt organizations generally should not constitute ubti however if an exempt organization finances its acquisition of the shares of our stock with debt a portion of its income from us will constitute ubti pursuant to the “debt financed property” rules likewise a portion of the exempt organization’s income from us would constitute ubti if we held a residual interest in a real estate mortgage investment conduit 

  

in addition in certain circumstances a pension trust that owns more than 10 of our stock is required to treat a percentage of our dividends as ubti this rule applies to a pension trust holding more than 10 of our stock only if 1 the percentage of our income that is ubti determined as if we were a pension trust is at least 5 2 we qualify as a reit by reason of the modification of the five or fewer requirement that allows beneficiaries of the pension trust to be treated as holding shares in proportion to their actuarial interests in the pension trust and 3 either i one pension trust owns more than 25 of the value of our stock or ii a group of pension trusts individually holding more than 10 of the value of our stock collectively own more than 50 of the value of our stock 

  

backup withholding and information reporting under certain circumstances you may be subject to backup withholding at applicable rates on payments made with respect to or cash proceeds of a sale or exchange of shares of our stock backup withholding will apply only if you 1 fail to provide a correct taxpayer identification number which if you are an individual is ordinarily your social security number 2 furnish an incorrect taxpayer identification number 3 are notified by the internal revenue service that you have failed to properly report payments of interest or dividends or 4 fail to certify under penalties of perjury that you have furnished a correct taxpayer identification number and that the internal revenue service has not notified you that you are subject to backup withholding 

  

backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients such as corporations and taxexempt organizations you should consult with a tax advisor regarding qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining an exemption backup withholding is not an additional tax rather the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a stockholder will be allowed as a credit against such stockholder’s united states federal income tax liability and may entitle such stockholder to a refund provided that the required information is provided to the internal revenue service in addition withholding a portion of capital gain distributions made to stockholders may be required for stockholders who fail to certify their nonforeign status 

  

taxation of foreign stockholders the following summary applies to you only if you are a foreign person the federal taxation of foreign persons is a highly complex matter that may be affected by many considerations 

  

  

except as discussed below distributions to you of cash generated by our real estate operations in the form of ordinary dividends but not by the sale or exchange of our capital assets generally will be subject to us withholding tax at a rate of 30 unless an applicable tax treaty reduces that tax and you file with us the required form evidencing the lower rate 

  

in general you will be subject to united states federal income tax on a graduated rate basis rather than withholding with respect to your investment in our stock if such investment is “effectively connected” with your conduct of a trade or business in the united states a corporate foreign stockholder that receives income that is or is treated as effectively connected with a united states trade or business may also be subject to the branch profits tax which is payable in addition to regular united states corporate income tax the following discussion will apply to foreign stockholders whose investment in us is not so effectively connected we expect to withhold united states income tax as described below on the gross amount of any distributions paid to you unless 1 you file an internal revenue service form w8eci with us claiming that the distribution is “effectively connected” or 2 certain other exceptions apply 

  

distributions by us that are attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a united states real property interest will be taxed to you under the foreign investment in real property tax act of 1980 “firpta” as if these distributions were gains “effectively connected” with a united states trade or business accordingly you will be taxed at the normal capital gain rates applicable to a us stockholder on these amounts subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals distributions subject to firpta may also be subject to a branch profits tax in the hands of a corporate foreign stockholder that is not entitled to treaty exemption 

  

we will be required to withhold from distributions subject to firpta and remit to the internal revenue service 35 of designated capital gain dividends or if greater 35 of the amount of any distributions that could be designated as capital gain dividends in addition if we designate prior distributions as capital gain dividends subsequent distributions up to the amount of the prior distributions not withheld against will be treated as capital gain dividends for purposes of withholding 

  

any capital gain dividend with respect to any class of stock that is “regularly traded” on an established securities market will be treated as an ordinary dividend if the foreign stockholder did not own more than 5 of such class of stock at any time during the taxable year foreign stockholders generally will not be required to report distributions received from us on us federal income tax returns and all distributions treated as dividends for us federal income tax purposes including any such capital gain dividends will be subject to a 30 us withholding tax unless reduced under an applicable income tax treaty as discussed above in addition the branch profits tax will not apply to such distributions 

  

unless our shares constitute a “united states real property interest” within the meaning of firpta or are effectively connected with a us trade or business a sale of our shares by you generally will not be subject to united states taxation our shares will not constitute a united states real property interest if we qualify as a “domestically controlled reit” we believe that we and expect to continue to qualify as a domestically controlled reit a domestically controlled reit is a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50 in value of its shares is held directly or indirectly by foreign stockholders however if you are a nonresident alien individual who is present in the united states for 183 days or more during the taxable year and certain other conditions apply you will be subject to a 30 tax on such capital gains in any event a purchaser of our shares from you will not be required under firpta to withhold on the purchase price if the purchased shares are “regularly traded” on an established securities market or if we are a domestically controlled reit otherwise under firpta the purchaser may be required to withhold 10 of the purchase price and remit such amount to the internal revenue service 

  

backup withholding tax and information reporting will generally not apply to distributions paid to you outside the united states that are treated as 1 dividends to which the 30 or lower treaty rate withholding tax discussed above applies 2 capital gains dividends or 3 distributions attributable to gain from the sale or exchange by us of us real property interests payment of the proceeds of a sale of stock within the united states or conducted through certain us related financial intermediaries is subject to both backup withholding and information reporting unless the beneficial owner certifies under penalties of perjury that he or she is not a us person and the payor does not have actual knowledge that the beneficial owner is a us person or otherwise established an exemption you may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for refund with the internal revenue service 

  

  withholding tax at a rate of 30 will be imposed on certain payments to you or certain foreign financial institutions including investment funds and other nonus persons receiving payments on your behalf including distributions in respect of shares of our stock and gross proceeds from the sale of shares of our stock if you or such institutions fail to comply with certain due diligence disclosure and reporting rules as set forth in recently issued treasury regulations accordingly the entity through which shares of our stock are held will affect the determination of whether such withholding is required withholding currently applies to payments of dividends made after june 30 2014 and will apply to payments of gross proceeds from a sale of shares of our stock made after december 31 2016 stockholders that are otherwise eligible for an exemption from or reduction of us withholding taxes with respect to such dividends and proceeds will be required to seek a refund from the internal revenue service to obtain the benefit of such exemption or reduction additional requirements and conditions may be imposed pursuant to an intergovernmental agreement if and when entered into between the united states and such institution’s home jurisdiction we will not pay any additional amounts to 

  

any stockholders in respect of any amounts withheld you are encouraged to consult with your tax advisor regarding us withholding taxes and the application of the recently issued treasury regulations in light of your particular circumstances 

  

us federal income taxation of holders of depositary shares 

  

owners of our depositary shares will be treated as if you were owners of the series of preferred stock represented by the depositary shares thus you will be required to take into account the income and deductions to which you would be entitled if you were a holder of the underlying series of preferred stock 

  

conversion or exchange of shares for preferred stock no gain or loss will be recognized upon the withdrawal of preferred stock in exchange for depositary shares and the tax basis of each share of preferred stock will upon exchange be the same as the aggregate tax basis of the depositary shares exchanged if you held your depositary shares as a capital asset at the time of the exchange for shares of preferred stock the holding period for your shares of preferred stock will include the period during which you owned the depositary shares

 item 1a risk factors 

  

  this section discusses the most significant factors that affect our business operations and financial condition it does not describe all risks and uncertainties applicable to us our industry or ownership of our securities if any of the following risks as well as other risks and uncertainties that are not yet identified or that we currently think are not material actually occur we could be materially adversely affected in that event the value of our securities could decline 

  

  we group these risk factors into three categories 

  

•   risks arising from our business 

  

•   risks arising from our capital structure and 

  

•   risks arising from our status as a reit 

  

risks arising from our business 

  

  

our investments in and acquisitions of health care and seniors housing properties may be unsuccessful or fail to meet our expectations 

  

  we are exposed to the risk that some of our acquisitions may not prove to be successful we could encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired properties including contingent liabilities and acquired properties might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business if we agree to provide construction funding to an operatortenant and the project is not completed we may need to take steps to ensure completion of the project such expenditures may negatively affect our results of operations furthermore there can be no assurance that our anticipated acquisitions and investments the completion of which is subject to various conditions will be consummated in accordance with anticipated timing on anticipated terms or at all we also may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties into our existing operations and this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

our investments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by our lack of exclusive control over these investments our partners’ insolvency or failure to meet their obligations and disputes between us and our partners 

  

  we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into partnerships or joint ventures with other persons or entities joint venture investments involve risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership including the possibility that our partner might become insolvent refuse to make capital contributions when due or otherwise fail to meet its obligations which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments that our partner might at any time have economic or other business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our interests or goals that we could become engaged in a dispute with our partner which could require us to expend additional resources to resolve such dispute and could have an adverse impact on the operations and profitability of the joint venture and that our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests in addition our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted in some instances we andor our partner may have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partner’s interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction our ability to acquire our partner’s interest may be limited if we do not have sufficient cash available borrowing capacity or other capital resources in such event we may be forced to sell our interest in the joint venture when we would otherwise prefer to retain it joint ventures may require us to share decisionmaking authority with our partners which could limit our ability to control the properties in the joint ventures even when we have a controlling interest certain major decisions may require partner approval such as the sale acquisition or financing of a property 

  

we are exposed to operational risks with respect to our seniors housing operating properties that could adversely affect our revenue and operations 

  

  we are exposed to various operational risks with respect to our seniors housing operating properties that may increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to generate revenues these risks include fluctuations in occupancy medicare and medicaid reimbursement if applicable and private pay rates economic conditions competition federal state local and industryregulated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards the availability and increases in cost of general and professional liability insurance coverage state regulation and rights of residents related to entrance fees and the availability and increases in the cost of labor as a result of unionization or otherwise any one or a combination of these factors may adversely affect our revenue and operations 

  

decreases in our operators’ revenues or increases in our operators’ expenses could affect our operators’ ability to make payments to us 

  

  our operators’ revenues are primarily driven by occupancy private pay rates and medicare and medicaid reimbursement if applicable expenses for these facilities are primarily driven by the costs of labor food utilities taxes insurance and rent or debt service revenues from government reimbursement have and may continue to come under pressure due to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls operating costs continue to increase for our operators to the extent that any decrease in revenues andor any increase in operating expenses result in a property not generating enough cash to make payments to us the credit of our operator and the value of other collateral would have to be relied upon to the extent the value of such property is reduced we may need to record an impairment for such asset furthermore if we determine to dispose of an underperforming property such sale may result in a loss any such impairment or loss on sale would negatively affect our financial results 

  

increased competition may affect our operators’ ability to meet their obligations to us 

  

  the operators of our properties compete on a local and regional basis with operators of properties and other health care providers that provide comparable services we cannot be certain that the operators of all of our facilities will be able to achieve and maintain 

  

occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us our operators are expected to encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to attract residents or expand their businesses 

  

the insolvency or bankruptcy of our obligors may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

  we are exposed to the risk that our obligors may not be able to meet the rent principal and interest or other payments due us which may result in an obligor bankruptcy or insolvency or that an obligor might become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings for other reasons although our operating lease agreements provide us with the right to evict a tenant demand immediate payment of rent and exercise other remedies and our loans provide us with the right to terminate any funding obligation demand immediate repayment of principal and unpaid interest foreclose on the collateral and exercise other remedies the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization an obligor in bankruptcy or subject to insolvency proceedings may be able to limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent in the case of a lease or to receive unpaid principal and interest in the case of a loan and to exercise other rights and remedies 

  

  we may be required to fund certain expenses eg real estate taxes and maintenance to preserve the value of an investment property avoid the imposition of liens on a property andor transition a property to a new tenant in some instances we have terminated our lease with a tenant and relet the property to another tenant in some of those situations we have provided working capital loans to and limited indemnification of the new obligor if we cannot transition a leased property to a new tenant we may take possession of that property which may expose us to certain successor liabilities should such events occur our revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely affected 

  

we may not be able to timely reinvest our sale proceeds on terms acceptable to us 

  

  from time to time we will have cash available from 1 the proceeds of sales of our securities 2 principal payments on our loans receivable and 3 the sale of properties including nonelective dispositions under the terms of master leases or similar financial support arrangements in order to maintain current revenues and continue generating attractive returns we expect to reinvest these proceeds in a timely manner we compete for real estate investments with a broad variety of potential investors this competition for attractive investments may negatively affect our ability to make timely investments on terms acceptable to us 

  

failure to properly manage our rapid growth could distract our management or increase our expenses 

  

  we have experienced rapid growth and development in a relatively short period of time and expect to continue this rapid growth in the future this growth has resulted in increased levels of responsibility for our management future property acquisitions could place significant additional demands on and require us to expand our management resources and personnel our failure to manage any such rapid growth effectively could harm our business and in particular our financial condition results of operations and cash flows which could negatively affect our ability to make distributions to stockholders our growth could also increase our capital requirements which may require us to issue potentially dilutive equity securities and incur additional debt 

  

we depend on genesis healthcare llc “genesis” for a significant portion of our revenues and any inability or unwillingness by genesis to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us could adversely affect us 

  

  the properties we lease to genesis account for a significant portion of our revenues and because our leases with genesis are triplenet leases we also depend on genesis to pay all insurance taxes utilities and maintenance and repair expenses in connection with the leased properties we cannot assure you that genesis will have sufficient assets income and access to financing to enable it to make rental payments to us or to otherwise satisfy its obligations under our leases and any inability or unwillingness by genesis to do so could have an adverse effect on us genesis has also agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with its business and we cannot assure you that genesis will have sufficient assets income access to financing and insurance coverage to enable it to satisfy its indemnification obligations 

  

the properties managed by sunrise senior living llc account for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income and any adverse developments in its business or financial condition could adversely affect us 

  

  sunrise senior living llc manages our entire sunrise property portfolio which as of december 31 2014 consisted of 140 seniors housing properties these properties account for a significant portion of our revenues and we rely on sunrise senior living llc to manage these properties efficiently and effectively any adverse developments in sunrise senior living llc’s business or financial condition could impair its ability to manage our properties efficiently and effectively which could adversely affect us 

  

ownership of property outside the united states may subject us to different or greater risks than those associated with our domestic operations 

  

  

  we have operations in canada and the united kingdom international development ownership and operating activities involve risks that are different from those we face with respect to our domestic properties and operations these risks include but are not limited to any international currency gain recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates may not qualify under the 75 gross income test or the 95 gross income test that we must satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a reit challenges with respect to the repatriation of foreign earnings and cash changes in foreign political regulatory and economic conditions including regionally nationally and locally challenges in managing international operations challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations including those relating to real estate corporate governance operations taxes employment and legal proceedings foreign ownership restrictions with respect to operations in countries differences in lending practices and the willingness of domestic or foreign lenders to provide financing regional or countryspecific business cycles and economic instability and failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations in the united states that affect foreign operations including but not limited to the us foreign corrupt practices act if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with international expansion and operations our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

  

we do not know if our tenants will renew their existing leases and if they do not we may be unable to lease the properties on as favorable terms or at all 

  

  we cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases at the end of their lease terms which expire at various times if these leases are not renewed we would be required to find other tenants to occupy those properties or sell them there can be no assurance that we would be able to identify suitable replacement tenants or enter into leases with new tenants on terms as favorable to us as the current leases or that we would be able to lease those properties at all 

  

our operators’ may not have the necessary insurance coverage to insure adequately against losses 

  

  in recent years longtermpostacute care and seniors housing operators have experienced substantial increases in both the number and size of patient care liability claims as a result general and professional liability costs have increased in some markets general and professional liability insurance coverage may be restricted or very costly which may adversely affect the property operators’ future operations cash flows and financial condition and may have a material adverse effect on the property operators’ ability to meet their obligations to us 

  

our ownership of properties through ground leases exposes us to the loss of such properties upon breach or termination of the ground leases 

  

  we have acquired an interest in certain of our properties by acquiring a leasehold interest in the property on which the building is located and we may acquire additional properties in the future through the purchase of interests in ground leases as the lessee under a ground lease we are exposed to the possibility of losing the property upon termination of the ground lease or an earlier breach of the ground lease by us 

  

the requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid could have a material adverse effect on our obligors’ liquidity financial condition and results of operations which could adversely affect our obligors’ ability to meet their obligations to us 

  

  some of our obligors’ businesses are affected by government reimbursement to the extent that an operatortenant receives a significant portion of its revenues from government payors primarily medicare and medicaid such revenues may be subject to statutory and regulatory changes retroactive rate adjustments recovery of program overpayments or setoffs court decisions administrative rulings policy interpretations payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers government funding restrictions at a program level or with respect to specific facilities and interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing government investigations and audits at such property in recent years government payors have frozen or reduced payments to health care providers due to budgetary pressures health care reimbursement will likely continue to be of paramount importance to federal and state authorities we cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or effect any future legislative reforms may have on the financial condition of our obligors and properties there can be no assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will be available for services provided by any property operator whether the property receives reimbursement from medicare medicaid or private payors significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on an obligor’s liquidity financial condition and results of operations which could adversely affect the ability of an obligor to meet its obligations to us see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — united states — reimbursement” above 

  

  the patient protection and affordable care act of 2010 as modified by the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the “health reform laws” provides those states that expand their medicaid coverage to otherwise eligible state residents with incomes at or below 138 of the federal poverty level with an increased federal medical assistance percentage effective january 1 2014 when certain conditions are met on june 28 2012 the united states supreme court upheld the individual mandate of the health reform laws but partially invalidated the expansion of medicaid the ruling on medicaid expansion allows 

  

states to elect not to participate in the expansion—and to forego funding for the medicaid expansion—without losing their existing medicaid funding given that the federal government substantially funds the medicaid expansion it is unclear how many states will ultimately pursue this option although as of late january 2015 roughly half of the states have expanded medicaid coverage the participation by states in the medicaid expansion could have the dual effect of increasing our tenants’ revenues through new patients but further straining state budgets and their ability to pay our tenants while the federal government will pay for approximately 100 of those additional costs from 2014 to 2016 states will be expected to pay for part of those additional costs beginning in 2017 in light of this at least one state that has passed legislation to allow the state to expand its medicaid coverage has included sunset provisions in the legislation that require that the expanded benefits be reduced or eliminated if the federal government’s funding for the program is decreased or eliminated permitting the state to revisit the issue once it begins to share financial responsibility for the expansion with increasingly strained budgets it is unclear how states that do not include such sunset provisions will pay their share of these additional medicaid costs and what other health care expenditures could be reduced as a result a significant reduction in other health care related spending by states to pay for increased medicaid costs could affect our tenants’ revenue streams see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — united states — reimbursement” above 

  

  more generally and because of the dynamic nature of the legislative and regulatory environment for health care products and services and in light of existing federal deficit and budgetary concerns we cannot predict the impact that broadbased farreaching legislative or regulatory changes could have on the us economy our business or that of our operators and tenants 

  

our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with federal state local and industryregulated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards could adversely affect such operators’ or tenants’ operations which could adversely affect our operators’ and tenants’ ability to meet their obligations to us 

  

  our operators and tenants generally are subject to varying levels of federal state local and industryregulated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with any of these laws regulations or standards could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension decertification or exclusion from federal and state health care programs loss of license or closure of the facility such actions may have an effect on our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make lease payments to us and therefore adversely impact us see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — united states — other related laws” above 

  

  many of our properties may require a license registration andor certificate of need “con” to operate failure to obtain a license registration or con or loss of a required license registration or con would prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by the operators or tenants these events could materially adversely affect our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make rent payments to us state and local laws also may regulate the expansion including the addition of new beds or services or acquisition of medical equipment and the construction or renovation of health care facilities by requiring a con or other similar approval from a state agency see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — united states — licensing and certification” above 

  

illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties 

  

  real estate investments are relatively illiquid our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in economic and other conditions will be limited no assurances can be given that we will recognize full value for any property that we are required to sell for liquidity reasons our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition we are exposed to the risks inherent in concentrating investments in real estate and in particular the seniors housing and health care industries a downturn in the real estate industry could adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to sell properties for a price or on terms acceptable to us 

  

unfavorable resolution of pending and future litigation matters and disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

  

  from time to time we may be directly involved in a number of legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims we may also be named as defendants in lawsuits allegedly arising out of our actions or the actions of our operatorstenants or managers in which such operatorstenants or managers have agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses an unfavorable resolution of pending or future litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition regardless of its outcome litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of management there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail in or achieve a favorable settlement of pending or future litigation in addition pending litigation or future litigation government proceedings or environmental matters could lead to increased costs or interruption of our normal business operations 

  

development redevelopment and construction risks could affect our profitability 

  

  

  at any given time we may be in the process of constructing one or more new facilities that ultimately will require a con and license before they can be utilized by the operator for their intended use the operator also may need to obtain medicare and medicaid certification and enter into medicare and medicaid provider agreements andor third party payor contracts in the event that the operator is unable to obtain the necessary con licensure certification provider agreements or contracts after the completion of construction there is a risk that we will not be able to earn any revenues on the facility until either the initial operator obtains a license or certification to operate the new facility and the necessary provider agreements or contracts or we find and contract with a new operator that is able to obtain a license to operate the facility for its intended use and the necessary provider agreements or contracts 

  

  in connection with our renovation redevelopment development and related construction activities we may be unable to obtain or suffer delays in obtaining necessary zoning landuse building occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations these factors could result in increased costs or our abandonment of these projects in addition we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms which may render us unable to proceed with our development activities and we may not be able to complete construction and leaseup of a property on schedule which could result in increased debt service expense or construction costs 

  

  additionally the time frame required for development construction and leaseup of these properties means that we may have to wait years for significant cash returns because we are required to make cash distributions to our stockholders if the cash flow from operations or refinancing is not sufficient we may be forced to borrow additional money to fund such distributions newly developed and acquired properties may not produce the cash flow that we expect which could adversely affect our overall financial performance 

  

  in deciding whether to acquire or develop a particular property we make assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property in particular we estimate the return on our investment based on expected occupancy rental rates and capital costs if our financial projections with respect to a new property are inaccurate as a result of increases in capital costs or other factors the property may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment our estimate of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove to be inaccurate which may result in our failure to meet our profitability goals additionally we may acquire new properties that are not fully leased and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with that property 

  

we may experience losses caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters which could result in an increase of our or our tenants’ cost of insurance a decrease in our anticipated revenues or a significant loss of the capital we have invested in a property 

  

  we maintain or require our tenants to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties with terms conditions limits and deductibles that we believe are appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage and we continually review our insurance programs and requirements however a large number of our properties are located in areas particularly susceptible to revenue loss cost increase or damage caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters such as hurricanes earthquakes tornadoes and floods we believe given current industry practice and analysis prepared by outside consultants that our and our tenants’ insurance coverage is appropriate to cover reasonably anticipated losses that may be caused by hurricanes earthquakes tornadoes floods and other severe weather conditions and natural disasters nevertheless we are always subject to the risk that such insurance will not fully cover all losses and depending on the severity of the event and the impact on our properties such insurance may not cover a significant portion of the losses these losses may lead to an increase of our and our tenants’ cost of insurance a decrease in our anticipated revenues from an affected property and a loss of all or a portion of the capital we have invested in an affected property in addition we or our tenants may not purchase insurance under certain circumstances if the cost of insurance exceeds in our or our tenants’ judgment the value of the coverage relative to the risk of loss 

  

we may incur costs to remediate environmental contamination at our properties which could have an adverse effect on our or our obligors’ business or financial condition 

  

  under various federal and state laws owners or operators of real estate may be required to respond to the presence or release of hazardous substances on the property and may be held liable for property damage personal injuries or penalties that result from environmental contamination or exposure to hazardous substances we may become liable to reimburse the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination generally such liability attaches to a person based on the person’s relationship to the property our tenants or borrowers are primarily responsible for the condition of the property moreover we review environmental site assessments of the properties that we own or encumber prior to taking an interest in them those assessments are designed to meet the “all appropriate inquiry” standard which we believe qualifies us for the innocent purchaser defense if environmental liabilities arise based upon such assessments we do not believe that any of our properties are subject to material environmental contamination however environmental liabilities may be present in our properties and we may incur costs to remediate contamination which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition or the business or financial condition of our obligors 

  

cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our business and result in the loss of confidential information 

  

  

  our business is at risk from and may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential data and other electronic security breaches such cyber attacks can range from individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems to more sophisticated security threats while we employ a number of measures to prevent detect and mitigate these threats there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a cyber attack cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our business and compromise the confidential information of our employees operators and tenants 

  

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain antitakeover provisions 

  

  our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain antitakeover provisions restrictions on share ownership and transfer and super majority stockholder approval requirements for business combinations that could make it more difficult for or even prevent a third party from acquiring us without the approval of our incumbent board of directors provisions and agreements that inhibit or discourage takeover attempts could reduce the market value of our common stock 

  

our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed 

  

  we are dependent on key personnel although we have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers losing any one of them could at least temporarily have an adverse impact on our operations we believe that losing more than one could have a material adverse impact on our business 

  

risks arising from our capital structure 

  

we may become more leveraged 

  

  permanent financing for our investments is typically provided through a combination of public offerings of debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt the incurrence or assumption of indebtedness may cause us to become more leveraged which could 1 require us to dedicate a greater portion of our cash flow to the payment of debt service 2 make us more vulnerable to a downturn in the economy 3 limit our ability to obtain additional financing or 4 negatively affect our credit ratings or outlook by one or more of the rating agencies 

  

we are subject to covenants in our debt agreements that may restrict or limit our operations and acquisitions and our failure to comply with the covenants in our debt agreements could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

  our debt agreements contain various covenants restrictions and events of default among other things these provisions require us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness create liens and make investments or acquisitions breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness in addition to any other indebtedness crossdefaulted against such instruments these defaults could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to make future investments or to meet our obligations and commitments 

  

  we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the capital necessary to make future investments or to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature our access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control including rising interest rates inflation and other general market conditions the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions the market price of the shares of our capital stock and the credit ratings of our debt securities the financial stability of our lenders which might impair their ability to meet their commitments to us or their willingness to make additional loans to us changes in the credit ratings on us government debt securities or default or delay in payment by the united states of its obligations if our access to capital is limited by these factors or other factors it could negatively impact our ability to acquire properties repay or refinance our indebtedness fund operations or make distributions to our stockholders 

  

downgrades in our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital 

  

  we plan to manage the company to maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile but there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity andor financial condition 

  

  

fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

  

  as we expand our operations internationally currency exchange rate fluctuations could affect our results of operations and financial position we expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenue and expenses in such foreign currencies as the canadian dollar and the british pound although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions andor obtain local currency mortgage debt in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies we cannot assure you that foreign currency fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on us 

  

our entry into swap agreements may not effectively reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates 

  

  we enter into swap agreements from time to time to manage some of our exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate volatility these swap agreements involve risks such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements in addition these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates when we use forwardstarting interest rate swaps there is a risk that we will not complete the longterm borrowing against which the swap is intended to hedge if such events occur our results of operations may be adversely affected 

  

risks arising from our status as a reit 

  

we might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

  

  we intend to operate as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” and believe we have and will continue to operate in such a manner if we lose our status as a reit we will face serious income tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for satisfying our obligations and for distribution to our stockholders because 

  

•   we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rates 

•   we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes and 

•   unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions we could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified 

  

  since reit qualification requires us to meet a number of complex requirements it is possible that we may fail to fulfill them and if we do our earnings will be reduced by the amount of us federal and other income taxes owed a reduction in our earnings would affect the amount we could distribute to our stockholders if we do not qualify as a reit we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders since a nonreit is not required to pay dividends to stockholders in order to maintain reit status or avoid an excise tax see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations” above for a discussion of the provisions of the code that apply to us and the effects of failure to qualify as a reit 

  

  in addition if we fail to qualify as a reit all distributions to stockholders would continue to be treated as dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits although corporate stockholders may be eligible for the dividends received deduction and individual stockholders may be eligible for taxation at the rates generally applicable to longterm capital gains currently at a maximum rate of 20 with respect to distributions 

  

  as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to implement our business strategy and would adversely affect the value of our common stock 

  

  qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to remain qualified as a reit although we believe that we qualify as a reit we cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify or remain qualified as a reit for us federal income tax purposes see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations” above 

  

certain subsidiaries might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

  

  as a result of our acquisition of shares in senior housing realty trust “shrt” we own a minority interest in an entity which elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes additionally we own substantially all of the outstanding stock of a subsidiary which we consolidate for financial reporting purposes but which is treated as a separate reit for federal income tax purposes together with shrt each a “subsidiary reit” to qualify as a reit each subsidiary reit must independently satisfy all of the reit qualification requirements under the code together with all other rules applicable to reits provided that each 

  

subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit our interests in the subsidiary reits will be treated as qualifying real estate assets for purposes of the reit asset tests see “item 1 – business – taxation – federal income tax considerations – qualification as a reit – asset tests” above if a subsidiary reit fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year such subsidiary reit will be subject to federal and state income taxes and may not be able to qualify as a reit for the four subsequent taxable years any such failure could have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reit income and asset tests and thus our ability to qualify as a reit unless we are able to avail ourselves of certain relief provisions 

  

the 90 annual distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions 

  

  to comply with the 90 distribution requirement applicable to reits and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax we must make distributions to our stockholders see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations — qualification as a reit — annual distribution requirements” above although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the reit distribution requirement it is possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90 distribution requirement or we may decide to retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation this may be due to timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses on the one hand and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income on the other hand in addition nondeductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of noncash deductions may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90 distribution requirement in the event that timing differences occur or we deem it appropriate to retain cash we may borrow funds issue additional equity securities although we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so pay taxable stock dividends if possible distribute other property or securities or engage in another transaction intended to enable us to meet the reit distribution requirements this may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations 

  

the lease of qualified health care properties to a taxable reit subsidiary is subject to special requirements 

  

  we lease certain qualified health care properties to taxable reit subsidiaries or limited liability companies of which the taxable reit subsidiaries are members which lessees contract with managers or related parties to manage the health care operations at these properties the rents from this taxable reit subsidiary lessee structure are treated as qualifying rents from real property if 1 they are paid pursuant to an armslength lease of a qualified health care property with a taxable reit subsidiary and 2 the manager qualifies as an eligible independent contractor as defined in the code if any of these conditions are not satisfied then the rents will not be qualifying rents see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations — qualification as a reit — income tests” above 

  

if certain saleleaseback transactions are not characterized by the internal revenue service as “true leases” we may be subject to adverse tax consequences 

  

  we have purchased certain properties and leased them back to the sellers of such properties and we may enter into similar transactions in the future we intend for any such saleleaseback transaction to be structured in such a manner that the lease will be characterized as a “true lease” thereby allowing us to be treated as the owner of the property for us federal income tax purposes however depending on the terms of any specific transaction the internal revenue service might take the position that the transaction is not a “true lease” but is more properly treated in some other manner in the event any saleleaseback transaction is challenged and successfully recharacterized by the internal revenue service we would not be entitled to claim the deductions for depreciation and cost recovery generally available to an owner of property furthermore if a saleleaseback transaction were so recharacterized we might fail to satisfy the reit asset tests or income tests and consequently could lose our reit status effective with the year of recharacterization see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations — qualification as a reit — asset tests” and “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations — qualification as a reit — income tests” above alternatively the amount of our reit taxable income could be recalculated which may cause us to fail to meet the reit annual distribution requirements for a taxable year see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations — qualification as a reit — annual distribution requirements” above

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  we are exposed to various market risks including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we seek to mitigate the underlying foreign currency exposures with gains and losses on derivative contracts hedging these exposures we seek to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates by matching the terms of new investments with new longterm fixed rate borrowings to the extent possible we may or may not elect to use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate exposure these decisions are principally based on our policy to match our variable rate investments with comparable borrowings but are also based on the general trend in interest rates at the applicable dates and our perception of the future volatility of interest rates this section is a discussion of the risks associated with potential fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates for additional information see “item 7 — management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — critical accounting policies” and notes 11 and 16 to our consolidated financial statements 

  we historically borrow on our primary unsecured credit facility to acquire construct or make loans relating to health care and seniors housing properties then as market conditions dictate we will issue equity or longterm fixed rate debt to repay the borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility we are subject to risks associated with debt financing including the risk that existing indebtedness may not be refinanced or that the terms of refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of current indebtedness the majority of our borrowings were completed under indentures or contractual agreements that limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur accordingly in the event that we are unable to raise additional equity or borrow money because of these limitations our ability to acquire additional properties may be limited 

  a change in interest rates will not affect the interest expense associated with our fixed rate debt interest rate changes however will affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt changes in the interest rate environment upon maturity of this fixed rate debt could have an effect on our future cash flows and earnings depending on whether the debt is replaced with other fixed rate debt variable rate debt or equity or repaid by the sale of assets to illustrate the impact of changes in the interest rate markets we performed a sensitivity analysis on our fixed rate debt instruments whereby we modeled the change in net present values arising from a hypothetical 1 increase in interest rates to determine the instruments’ change in fair value the following table summarizes the analysis performed as of the dates indicated in thousands 



  our variable rate debt including our unsecured line of credit arrangements is reflected at fair value at december 31 2014 we had 983783000 outstanding related to our variable rate debt assuming no changes in outstanding balances a 1 increase in interest rates would result in increased annual interest expense of 9838000 at december 31 2013 we had 1089362000 outstanding related to our variable rate debt assuming no changes in outstanding balances a 1 increase in interest rates would have resulted in increased annual interest expense of 10894000 

  we are subject to currency fluctuations that may from time to time affect our financial condition and results of operations increases or decreases in the value of the canadian dollar or pounds sterling relative to the us dollar impacts the amount of net income we earn from our investments in canada and the united kingdom based solely on our results for the twelve months ended december 31 2014 if these exchange rates were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points our net income from these investments would decrease or increase as applicable by less than 500000 for the twelvemonth period we seek to mitigate these underlying foreign currency exposures with nonus denominated borrowings and gains and losses on derivative contracts hedging these exposures if we increase our international presence through investments in or acquisitions or development of seniors housing and health care properties outside the united states we may also decide to transact additional business or borrow funds in currencies other than the us dollar canadian dollars or pounds sterling to illustrate the impact of changes in foreign currency markets we performed a sensitivity analysis on our derivative portfolio whereby we modeled the change in net present values arising from a hypothetical 1 increase in foreign currency exchange rates to determine the instruments’ change in fair value the following table summarizes the results of the analysis performed excluding cross currency hedge activity dollars in thousands

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

management has assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2014 based on the criteria established by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 2013 framework in a report entitled internal control — integrated framework 

  

the scope of management’s assessment as of december 31 2014 did not include an assessment of the internal control over financial reporting for the gracewell healthcare acquisition because the business combination occurred during the year ended december 31 2014 the acquired businesses represent 1 of total assets at december 31 2014 and less than 1 of revenues and net operating income for the year then ended the scope of management’s assessment on internal control over financial reporting for the year ended december 31 2015 will include the aforementioned acquired operations 

  

based on this assessment using the criteria above management concluded that the company’s system of internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2014 

  

the independent registered public accounting firm of ernst  young llp as auditors of the company’s consolidated financial statements has issued an attestation report on the company’s internal control over financial reporting

report of independent registered public accounting firm on internal control over financial reporting 

  

the board of directors and shareholders of health care reit inc 

  

  we have audited health care reit inc’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2014 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria 2013 framework health care reit inc’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit

  a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

  because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

investments 

  

depending upon market conditions we believe that new investments will be available in the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to our stockholders we invest in seniors housing and health care real estate primarily through acquisitions developments and joint venture partnerships for additional information regarding acquisition and development activity please see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements we diversify our investment portfolio by property type relationship and geographic location in determining whether to invest in a property we focus on the following 1 the experience of the obligor’spartner’s management team 2 the historical and projected financial and operational performance of the property 3 the credit of the obligorpartner 4 the security for any lease or loan 5 the real estate attributes of the building and its location 6 the capital committed to the property by the obligorpartner and 7 the operating fundamentals of the applicable industry we conduct market research and analysis for all potential investments in addition we review the value of all properties the interest rates and covenant requirements of any facilitylevel debt to be assumed at the time of the acquisition and the anticipated sources of repayment of any existing debt that is not to be assumed at the time of the acquisition 

  

we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property our proactive and comprehensive asset management process for seniors housing properties generally includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each property review of obligorpartner creditworthiness property inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure real estate taxes letters of credit and other collateral our internal property management division actively manages and monitors the medical office building portfolio with a comprehensive process including review of among other things tenant relations lease expirations the mix of health service providers hospitalhealth system relationships property performance capital improvement needs and market conditions in monitoring our portfolio our personnel use a proprietary database to collect and analyze propertyspecific data additionally we conduct extensive research to ascertain industry trends 

  

we evaluate the operating environment in each property’s market to determine the likely trend in operating performance of the facility when we identify unacceptable trends we seek to mitigate eliminate or transfer the risk through these efforts we are generally able to intervene at an early stage to address any negative trends and in so doing support both the collectability of revenue and the value of our investment 

  

investment types 

  

real property our properties are primarily comprised of land buildings improvements and related rights our hospitals and seniors housing triplenet properties are generally leased to operators under longterm operating leases the leases generally have a fixed contractual term of 12 to 15 years and contain one or more five to 15year renewal options certain of our leases also contain purchase options a portion of which could result in the disposition of properties for less than full market value most of our rents are received under triplenet leases requiring the operator to pay rent and all additional charges incurred in the operation of the leased property the tenants are required to repair rebuild and maintain the leased properties substantially all of these operating leases are designed with escalating rent structures leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straightline basis over the initial lease period subject to a collectability assessment rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period 

  

 

  

at december 31 2013 approximately 92 of our hospitals and seniors housing triplenet properties were subject to master leases a master lease is a lease of multiple properties to one tenant entity under a single lease agreement from time to time we may acquire additional properties that are then leased to the tenant under the master lease the tenant is required to make one monthly payment that represents rent on all the properties that are subject to the master lease typically the master lease tenant can exercise its right to purchase the properties or to renew the master lease only with respect to all leased properties at the same time this bundling feature benefits us because the tenant cannot limit the purchase or renewal to the better performing properties and terminate the leasing arrangement with respect to the poorer performing properties this spreads our risk among the entire group of properties within the master lease the bundling feature should provide a similar advantage to us if the master lease tenant is in bankruptcy subject to certain restrictions a debtor in bankruptcy has the right to assume or reject each of its leases it is our intent that a tenant in bankruptcy would be required to assume or reject the master lease as a whole rather than deciding on a property by property basis 

  

our medical office building portfolio is primarily selfmanaged and consists principally of multitenant properties leased to health care providers our leases typically include increasers and some form of operating expense reimbursement by the tenant as of december 31 2013 76 of our portfolio included leases with full pass through 20 with a partial expense reimbursement modified gross and 4 with no expense reimbursement gross our medical office building leases are noncancellable operating leases that have a weightedaverage remaining term of eight years at december 31 2013 and are often credit enhanced by security deposits guaranties andor letters of credit 

  

construction we occasionally provide for the construction of properties for tenants as part of longterm operating leases we capitalize certain interest costs associated with funds used for the construction of properties owned by us the amount capitalized is based upon the amount advanced during the construction period using the rate of interest that approximates our companywide cost of financing our interest expense is reduced by the amount capitalized we also typically charge a transaction fee at the commencement of construction which we defer and amortize to income over the term of the resulting lease the construction period commences upon funding and terminates upon the earlier of the completion of the applicable property or the end of a specified period during the construction period we advance funds to the tenants in accordance with agreed upon terms and conditions which require among other things periodic site visits by a company representative during the construction period we generally require an additional credit enhancement in the form of payment and performance bonds andor completion guaranties at december 31 2013 we had outstanding construction investments of 141085000 and were committed to provide additional funds of approximately 243083000 to complete construction for investment properties 

  

real estate loans our real estate loans are typically structured to provide us with interest income principal amortization and transaction fees and are generally secured by firstsecond mortgage liens leasehold mortgages corporate guaranties andor personal guaranties at december 31 2013 we had outstanding real estate loans of 332146000 the interest yield averaged approximately 84 per annum on our outstanding real estate loan balances our yield on real estate loans depends upon a number of factors including the stated interest rate average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments the real estate loans outstanding at december 31 2013 are generally subject to one to 15year terms with principal amortization schedules andor balloon payments of the outstanding principal balances at the end of the term typically real estate loans are crossdefaulted and crosscollateralized with other real estate loans operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its affiliates 

  

  investments in unconsolidated entities  our investments in unconsolidated entities generally represent interests ranging from 10 to 50 in real estate assets investments in less than majority owned entities are reported under the equity method of accounting when our interests represent either 1 general partnership interests subject to substantive participating or kickout rights that have been granted to the limited partners or 2 limited partnership interests with no control over major operating and financial policies of the entities under the equity method of accounting our share of the investee’s earnings or losses is included in our consolidated results of operations to the extent that our cost basis is different from the basis reflected at the entity level the basis difference is generally amortized over the lives of the related assets and liabilities and such amortization is included in our share of equity in earnings of the entity the initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated entities is based on the amount paid to purchase the entity interest or the estimated fair value of the assets prior to the sale of interests in the entity other equity investments include an investment in availableforsale securities these equity investments represented a minimal ownership interest in these companies we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the equity method investment to its carrying value when we determine a decline in the estimated fair value of such an investment below its carrying value is otherthantemporary an impairment is recorded see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for more information 

  

principles of consolidation 

  

the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our whollyowned subsidiaries and joint venture entities that we control through voting rights or other means all material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation 

  

 

  

at inception of joint venture transactions we identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights “variable interest entities” or “vies” and determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of its operations a vie is broadly defined as an entity where either i the equity investors as a group if any do not have a controlling financial interest or ii the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support we consolidate investments in vies when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary accounting standards codification topic 810 consolidations  requires enterprises to perform a qualitative approach to determining whether or not a vie will need to be consolidated on a continuous basis this evaluation is based on an enterprise’s ability to direct and influence the activities of a vie that most significantly impact that entity’s economic performance 

  

for investments in joint ventures we evaluate the type of rights held by the limited partners which may preclude consolidation in circumstances in which the sole general partner would otherwise consolidate the limited partnership the assessment of limited partners’ rights and their impact on the presumption of control over a limited partnership by the sole general partner should be made when an investor becomes the sole general partner and should be reassessed if i there is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights of the limited partners ii the sole general partner increases or decreases its ownership in the limited partnership interests or iii there is an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding limited partnership interests we similarly evaluate the rights of managing members of limited liability companies 

  

borrowing policies 

  

we utilize a combination of debt and equity to fund investments our debt and equity levels are determined by management to maintain a conservative credit profile generally we intend to issue unsecured fixedrate public debt with longterm maturities to approximate the maturities on our triplenet leases and loans for shortterm purposes we may borrow on our primary unsecured line of credit arrangement we replace these borrowings with longterm capital such as senior unsecured notes common stock or preferred stock when terms are deemed favorable we may invest in properties subject to existing mortgage indebtedness in addition we may obtain secured financing for unleveraged properties in which we have invested or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis in certain agreements with our lenders we are subject to restrictions with respect to secured and unsecured indebtedness 

  

competition 

  

we compete with other real estate investment trusts real estate partnerships private equity and hedge fund investors banks insurance companies financeinvestment companies governmentsponsored agencies taxable and taxexempt bond funds health care operators developers and other investors in the acquisition development leasing and financing of health care and seniors housing properties we compete for investments based on a number of factors including investment structures underwriting criteria and reputation our ability to successfully compete is impacted by economic and demographic trends availability of acceptable investment opportunities our ability to negotiate beneficial investment terms availability and cost of capital construction and renovation costs and new and existing laws and regulations 

  

the operatorstenants of our properties compete on a local and regional basis with operatorstenants of properties that provide comparable services operatorstenants compete for patients and residents based on a number of factors including quality of care reputation physical appearance of properties location services offered family preferences physicians staff and price we also face competition from other health care facilities for tenants such as physicians and other health care providers that provide comparable facilities and services

certain government regulations 

  

united states 

  

health law matters — generally 

  

 

  

  typically operators of seniors housing facilities do not receive significant funding from government programs and are largely subject to state laws as opposed to federal laws operators of skilled nursing facilities and hospitals do receive significant funding from government programs and these facilities are subject to the federal and state laws that regulate the type and quality of the medical andor nursing care provided ancillary services  eg respiratory occupational physical and infusion therapies qualifications of the administrative personnel and nursing staff the adequacy of the physical plant and equipment reimbursement and rate setting and operating policies in addition as described below operators of these facilities are subject to extensive laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including but not limited to the federal antikickback statute the federal stark law and the federal false claims act as well as comparable state law counterparts hospitals physician group practice clinics and other health care providers that operate in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal state and local licensure registration certification and inspection laws regulations and industry standards our tenants’ failure to comply with any of these and other laws could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension decertification or exclusion from federal and state health care programs loss of license or closure of the facility 

  

licensing and certification 

  

the primary regulations that affect seniors housing facilities with assisted living are state licensing and registration laws in granting and renewing these licenses the state regulatory agencies consider numerous factors relating to a property’s physical plant and operations including but not limited to admission and discharge standards staffing and training a decision to grant or renew a license is also affected by a property owner’s record with respect to patient and consumer rights medication guidelines and rules certain of the seniors housing facilities mortgaged to or owned by us may require the resident to pay an entrance or upfront fee a portion of which may be refundable these entrance fee communities are subject to significant state regulatory oversight including for example oversight of each facility’s financial condition establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial restrictions the right of residents to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time lien rights in favor of residents restrictions on change of ownership and similar matters such oversight and the rights of residents within these entrance fee communities may have an effect on the revenue or operations of the operators of such facilities and therefore may adversely affect us 

  

  certain health care facilities are subject to a variety of licensure and certificate of need “con” laws and regulations where applicable con laws generally require among other requirements that a facility demonstrate the need for 1 constructing a new facility 2 adding beds or expanding an existing facility 3 investing in major capital equipment or adding new services 4 changing the ownership or control of an existing licensed facility or 5 terminating services that have been previously approved through the con process certain state con laws and regulations may restrict the ability of operators to add new properties or expand an existing facility’s size or services in addition con laws may constrain the ability of an operator to transfer responsibility for operating a particular facility to a new operator if we have to replace a property operator who is excluded from participating in a federal or state health care program as discussed below our ability to replace the operator may be affected by a particular state’s con laws regulations and applicable guidance governing changes in provider control 

  

  with respect to licensure generally our skilled nursing facilities and acute care facilities are required to be licensed and certified for participation in medicare medicaid and other federal health care programs this generally requires license renewals and compliance surveys on an annual or biannual basis the failure of our operators to maintain or renew any required license or regulatory approval as well as the failure of our operators to correct serious deficiencies identified in a compliance survey could require those operators to discontinue operations at a property in addition if a property is found to be out of compliance with medicare medicaid or other health care program conditions of participation the property operator may be excluded from participating in those government health care programs any such occurrence may impair an operator’s ability to meet their financial obligations to us if we have to replace an excludedproperty operator our ability to replace the operator may be affected by federal and state laws regulations and applicable guidance governing changes in provider control this may result in payment delays an inability to find a replacement operator a significant working capital commitment from us to a new operator or other difficulties 

  

  reimbursement 

  

  seniors housing facilities excluding skilled nursing facilities approximately 71 of our overall revenues including discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2013 were attributable to seniors housing facilities the majority of the revenues received by the operators of these facilities are from private pay sources the remaining revenue source is primarily medicaid under certain waiver programs as a part of the omnibus budget reconciliation act “obra” of 1981 congress established a waiver program enabling some states to offer medicaid reimbursement to assisted living providers as an alternative to institutional longterm care services the provisions of obra and the subsequent obra acts of 1987 and 1990 permit states to seek a waiver from typical medicaid requirements to develop costeffective alternatives to longterm care including medicaid payments for assisted living and home health as of september 30 2013 ten of our forty seniors housing operators received medicaid 

 

  

reimbursement pursuant to medicaid waiver programs for the twelve months ended september 30 2013 approximately 2 of the revenues at our seniors housing facilities were from medicaid reimbursement there can be no guarantee that a state medicaid program operating pursuant to a waiver will be able to maintain its waiver status 

  

  rates paid by selfpay residents are set by the facilities and are determined by local market conditions and operating costs generally facilities receive a higher payment per day for a private pay resident than for a medicaid beneficiary who requires a comparable level of care the level of medicaid reimbursement varies from state to state thus the revenues generated by operators of our assisted living facilities may be adversely affected by payor mix acuity level changes in medicaid eligibility and reimbursement levels in addition a state could lose its medicaid waiver and no longer be permitted to utilize medicaid dollars to reimburse for assisted living services changes in revenues could in turn have a material adverse effect on an operator’s ability to meet its obligations to us 

  

  skilled nursing facilities and hospitals skilled nursing facilities and hospitals typically receive most of their revenues from the medicare and medicaid programs with the balance representing reimbursement payments from private payors including private insurers consequently changes in federal or state reimbursement policies may also adversely affect an operator’s ability to cover its expenses including our rent or debt service skilled nursing facilities and hospitals are subject to periodic pre and postpayment reviews and other audits by federal and state authorities a review or audit of a property operator’s claims could result in recoupments denials or delay of payments in the future which could have a material adverse effect on the operator’s ability to meet its financial obligations to us due to the significant judgments and estimates inherent in payor settlement accounting no assurance can be given as to the adequacy of any reserves maintained by our property operators to cover potential adjustments to reimbursements or to cover settlements made to payors in fact in december 2010 the department of health and human services “hhs” office of inspector general “oig” released a report focusing on skilled nursing facilities’ billing practices for medicare part a payments and found that between 20062008 skilled nursing facilities increasingly billed for higher paying resource utilization groups “rugs” the payment classification mechanism for the medicare program even though beneficiary characteristics remained largely unchanged in particular from 2006 to 2008 oig found that the percentage of rugs for ultra high therapy increased from 17 to 28 despite the fact that beneficiaries’ ages and diagnoses at admission were largely unchanged during that time period in november 2012 the oig released a report focused on inappropriate payments to skilled nursing facilities and found that of the 499 claims from 2009 that were reviewed in the study skilled nursing facilities billed 25 of the claims in error and misreported information on the minimum data set “mds” for 47 of the claims in february 2013 oig issued the third report in this series concluding that medicare paid 51 billion to skilled nursing facilities for stays that did not meet certain qualityofcare requirements recent attention on skilled nursing billing practices and payments or ongoing government pressure to reduce spending by government health care programs could result in lower payments to skilled nursing facilities and as a result may impair an operator’s ability to meet its financial obligations to us 

  

  medicare reimbursement and skilled nursing facilities for the twelve months ended september 30 2013 approximately 29 of the revenues at our skilled nursing facilities which comprised 12 of our overall revenues including discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2013 were paid by medicare skilled nursing facilities are reimbursed under the medicare skilled nursing facility prospective payment system “snf pps” there is a risk that some skilled nursing facilities’ costs will exceed the fixed payments under the snf pps and there is also a risk that payments under the snf pps may be set below the costs to provide certain items and services which could result in immediate financial difficulties for skilled nursing facilities and could cause operators to seek bankruptcy protection skilled nursing facilities have faced these types of difficulties since the implementation of the snf pps 

  

  the centers for medicare  medicaid services “cms” an agency of the us department of health and human services “hhs” made a positive payment update for skilled nursing facilities for fiscal year 2014 on july 31 2013 cms issued a final rule for the snf pps that sets forth payment rate changes for the 2014 fiscal year under the final rule snfs will receive a net payment increase of 13 which is based on a 23 increase in the snf market basket less a 05 forecast error adjustment and less a 05 multifactor productivity adjustment cms is implementing a forecast error adjustment because the forecasted fiscal year 2012 market basket percentage change exceeded the actual snf market basket percentage change by 051 a figure that is in excess of the 05 threshold adopted by the agency for determining when a forecast error adjustment will be applied 

  

  in addition on november 21 2011 the joint select committee on deficit reduction which was created by the budget control act of 2011 concluded its work and issued a statement that it was not able to make a bipartisan agreement thus triggering the sequestration process on january 2 2013 president obama signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 “taxpayer relief act” which delayed the sequestration process until march 2013 the sequester went into effect march 1 2013 and effective april 1 2013 provider payments under medicare parts a and b medicare advantage and medicare part d were reduced up to 2 annually however medicaid spending and most of the spending on subsidies are exempt from reduction on january 21 2014 president obama signed the fiscal year 2014 omnibus appropriations bill which lifted the sequester that went info effect on march 1 

 

  

2013 the taxpayer relief act also increased the multiple procedure discount for part b therapy services from 25 to 50 effective april 2013 which will lower revenues for certain operators or tenants 

  

  section 5008 of the deficit reduction act of 2005 directed the secretary of hhs to conduct a post acute care payment reform demonstration “pacprd” program for a three year period beginning january 1 2008 to assess the costs and outcomes of patients discharged from hospitals in a variety of postacute care settings including skilled nursing facilities the demonstration program’s results and recommendations were reported to congress in a january 2012 report the results and recommendations could lead to future changes in medicare coverage reimbursement and reporting requirements for postacute care 

  

  the balanced budget act of 1997 mandated caps on medicare reimbursement for certain therapy services however congress imposed various waivers on the implementation of those caps the middle class tax relief and job creation act of 2012 “job creation act” made a number of changes including effective on october 1 2012 applying the therapy caps to outpatient hospitals creating two new threshold amounts of 3700 one for each therapy cap amount and requiring a manual medical review process of claims over these new thresholds cms announced on march 1 2013 that until the agency provides further guidance all therapy claims that are suspended for manual medical review of therapy services above the 3700 threshold will be subject to prepayment medical review the taxpayer relief act extended the job creation act provisions related to payment for medicare outpatient therapy services and extended the historical therapy cap waiver and exceptions process but only through december 31 2013 pursuant to the calendar year 2014 medicare physician fee schedule the therapy cap limitation also applies to services provided at critical access hospitals these therapy caps may negatively impact payments to skilled nursing facilities 

  

  if the waiver program is not reinstituted patients will need to use private funds to pay for the cost of therapy above the caps if patients are unable to satisfy their outofpocket cost responsibility to reimburse an operator for services rendered the operator’s ability to meet its financial obligations to us could be adversely impacted 

  

  medicare reimbursement and hospitals for the twelve months ended september 30 2013 approximately 57 of the revenues at our hospitals which comprised 3 of our overall revenues including discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2013 were from medicare reimbursements hospitals generally are reimbursed by medicare under the hospital inpatient prospective payment system “pps” the hospital outpatient prospective payment system “opps” the long term care hospital prospective payment system “ltch pps” or the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system “irf pps” acute care hospitals provide a wide range of inpatient and outpatient services including but not limited to surgery rehabilitation therapy and clinical laboratory services longterm acute care hospitals provide inpatient services for patients with medical conditions that are often complex and that require more intensive care monitoring or emergency support than that available in most skilled nursing facilities inpatient rehabilitation facilities provide intensive rehabilitation services in an inpatient setting for patients requiring at least three hours of rehabilitation services a day 

  

with respect to medicare’s pps for regular hospitals reimbursement for inpatient services is made on the basis of a fixed prospective rate based on the principal diagnosis of the patient hospitals may be at risk to the extent that their costs in treating a specific case exceed the fixed payment amount the diagnosis related group “drg” reimbursement system was updated in 2008 to expand the number of drgs from 538 to 745 in order to better distinguish more severe conditions the subsequent addition of new drgs has now raised the total number of drgs to 751 in some cases a hospital might be able to qualify for an outlier payment if the hospital’s losses exceed a threshold 

  

on august 2 2013 cms issued a final rule for the medicare inpatient prospective payment system which sets forth acute care and longterm care hospital payment rate changes for the 2014 fiscal year which began on october 1 2013 under the final rule the medicare rates for inpatient services at acute care hospitals will increase by 07 and rates for longterm care hospitals will increase by 04 accounting for adjustments such as the multifactor productivity adjustment and the second year adjustment for a threeyear phasein of a onetime 375 budget neutrality adjustment to the longterm care hospital rate cms finalized its proposal to let expire the oneyear extension of the existing moratorium on the 25 threshold policy a policy that imposes lower medicare payments in certain circumstances on those longterm care hospitals that admit more than 25 of their patients from a single acute care hospital the expiration of the moratorium on the 25 threshold policy will impact cost reporting periods which begin on or after october 1 2013 under the final rule cms also finalized a number of changes to comply with the patient protection and affordable care act of 2010 “ppaca” and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 which amends the ppaca collectively the “health reform laws”  beginning in fiscal year 2014 hospitals that rank among the lowestperforming 25 with regard to hospitalacquired conditions will see a 1 reduction in medicare payment rates cms will also increase the maximum payment reduction under the hospital readmissions reduction program which began on october 1 2012 to 2 of payment amounts in fiscal year 2014 for fiscal year 2014 cms is increasing the applicable percentage reduction the portion of medicare payments available to fund the valuebased purchasing program’s valuebased incentive payments to 125 as required by statute cms clarified its regulations to reflect an existing policy that the inpatient prospective payment system comparable per diem amount is capped at an amount 

 

  

comparable to what would have been a full payment under the inpatient prospective payment system and that cap applies to short stay cases in longterm care hospitals with discharges occurring on or after december 29 2012 

  

notably from 2007 through the end of 2012 there was a statutory moratorium imposed by the medicare medicaid and schip extension act of 2007 “mmsea” and subsequent amendments on new ltch beds and facilities which reduced the opportunities for expansion now that this moratorium has been lifted such facilities have the option to increase their capacity and services it is unclear at this time what impact if any this change will have on our operators and tenants and our business generally 

  

on july 31 2013 cms issued a final rule for the medicare inpatient rehabilitation facilities prospective payment system that sets forth payment rate changes for the 2014 fiscal year under the final rule for fiscal year 2014 the medicare rates for inpatient rehabilitation facilities will increase by 18 which includes a 26 market basket increase factor reduced by a 05 multifactor productivity adjustment and an additional 03 point reduction as required by the health reform laws 

  

  on december 10 2013 cms published the medicare hospital outpatient prospective payment and ambulatory surgical center payment system final rule for calendar year 2014 which sets payment rates for outpatient care hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers cms estimates that the rates and policies in the final rule will increase payment rates for ambulatory surgery centers by 12 

  

medicare reimbursement and physicians cms annually adjusts the medicare physician fee schedule payment rates based on an update formula that includes application of the sustainable growth rate “sgr” on november 27 2013 cms issued the calendar year 2013 physician fee schedule final rule which called for a negative 201 update under the statutory sgr formula with the enactment of the bipartisan budget act of 2013 on december 26 2013 the reimbursement cut that was to occur was replaced with a 05 increase for services provided through march 31 2014 congress has overridden the required reduction every year since 2003 the final rule continues implementation of quality and cost measures that will be used in establishing a new value−based modifier that would adjust physician payments based on whether they are providing higher quality and more efficient care the health reform laws as defined below require cms to begin making payment adjustments to certain physicians and physician groups on january 1 2015 and to apply the modifier to all physicians by january 1 2017 calendar year 2013 is the initial performance year for purposes of adjusting payments in calendar year 2015 

  

medicaid reimbursement medicaid is a major payor source for residents in our skilled nursing facilities and hospitals for the twelve months ended september 30 2013 approximately 48 of the revenues of our skilled nursing facilities and 3 of the revenues of our hospitals were attributable to medicaid reimbursement payments the federal and state governments share responsibility for financing medicaid the federal matching rate known as the federal medical assistance percentage “fmap” varies by state based on relative per capita income but is at least 50 in all states on average medicaid is the largest component of total state spending representing approximately 237 of total state expenditures in state fiscal year 2011 the percentage of medicaid dollars used for longterm care varies from state to state due in part to different ratios of elderly population and eligibility requirements within certain federal guidelines states have a fairly wide range of discretion to determine eligibility and reimbursement methodology many states reimburse longterm care facilities using fixed daily rates which are applied prospectively based on patient acuity and the historical costs incurred in providing patient care reasonable costs typically include allowances for staffing administrative and general expenses property and equipment  eg  real estate taxes depreciation and fair rental 

  

in most states medicaid does not fully reimburse the cost of providing skilled nursing services certain states are attempting to slow the rate of growth in medicaid expenditures by freezing rates or restricting eligibility and benefits our skilled nursing portfolio’s average medicaid rate will likely vary throughout the year as states continue to make interim changes to their budgets and medicaid funding in addition medicaid reimbursement rates may decline if revenues in a particular state are not sufficient to fund budgeted expenditures president obama’s proposed fiscal year budget for 2013 included several proposals that would have lowered federal spending for medicaid potentially impacting provider medicaid reimbursement rates the proposals included new limits on state provider taxes phasing down the existing medicaid provider tax and blending the federal matching rate for state medicaid and the children’s health insurance program although the president’s proposed fiscal year budget for 2014 did not include these proposals it nevertheless called for an overall reduction in federal health care spending by 401 billion over ten years with savings stemming from several costsaving proposals including reduced medicare payments for longterm care hospitals snfs and other postacute care providers 

  

the medicare part d drug benefit became effective january 1 2006 since that date lowincome medicare beneficiaries eligible for both medicare and full medicaid benefits including those nursing home residents who are dually eligible for both programs may enroll and receive outpatient prescription drugs under medicare not medicaid medicare part d has resulted in increased administrative responsibilities for nursing home operators because enrollment in medicare part d is voluntary and residents must 

 

  

choose between multiple prescription drug plans operators may also experience increased expenses to the extent that a particular drug prescribed to a patient is not listed on the medicare part d drug plan formulary for the plan in which the patient is enrolled 

  

the reimbursement methodologies applied to health care facilities continue to evolve federal and state authorities have considered and may seek to implement new or modified reimbursement methodologies that may negatively impact health care property operations the impact of any such changes if implemented may result in a material adverse effect on our skilled nursing and hospital property operations no assurance can be given that current revenue sources or levels will be maintained accordingly there can be no assurance that payments under a government health care program are currently or will be in the future sufficient to fully reimburse the property operators for their operating and capital expenses as a result an operator’s ability to meet its financial obligations to us could be adversely impacted 

  

finally the health reform laws further discussed below may have a significant impact on medicare medicaid other federal health care programs and private insurers which impact the reimbursement amounts received by skilled nursing facilities and other health care providers the health reform laws could have a substantial and material adverse effect on all parties directly or indirectly involved in the health care system 

  

other related laws 

  

skilled nursing facilities and hospitals and seniors housing facilities that receive medicaid payments are subject to federal state and local laws regulations and applicable guidance that govern the operations and financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by health care providers certain of these laws prohibit direct or indirect payments of any kind for the purpose of inducing or encouraging the referral of patients for medical products or services reimbursable by government health care programs other laws require providers to furnish only medically necessary services and submit to the government valid and accurate statements for each service still other laws require providers to comply with a variety of safety health and other requirements relating to the condition of the licensed property and the quality of care provided sanctions for violations of these laws regulations and other applicable guidance may include but are not limited to criminal andor civil penalties and fines loss of licensure immediate termination of government payments and exclusion from any government health care program in certain circumstances violation of these rules such as those prohibiting abusive and fraudulent behavior with respect to one property may subject other facilities under common control or ownership to sanctions including exclusion from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs as well as other government health care programs in the ordinary course of its business a property operator is regularly subjected to inquiries investigations and audits by the federal and state agencies that oversee these laws and regulations 

  

all health care providers including but not limited to skilled nursing facilities and hospitals and seniors housing facilities that receive medicaid payments are also subject to the federal antikickback statute which generally prohibits persons from offering providing soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing of a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal health care program such as medicare or medicaid skilled nursing facilities and hospitals are also subject to the federal ethics in patient referral act of 1989 commonly referred to as the stark law the stark law generally prohibits the submission of claims to medicare for payment if the claim results from a physician referral for certain designated services and the physician has a financial relationship with the health service provider that does not qualify under one of the exceptions for a financial relationship under the stark law similar prohibitions on physician selfreferrals and submission of claims apply to state medicaid programs further health care providers including but not limited to skilled nursing facilities and hospitals and seniors housing facilities that receive medicaid payments are subject to substantial financial penalties under the civil monetary penalties act and the federal false claims act and in particular actions under the federal false claims act’s “whistleblower” provisions private enforcement of health care fraud has increased due in large part to amendments to the federal false claims act that encourage private individuals to sue on behalf of the government these whistleblower suits brought by private individuals known as qui tam actions may be filed by almost anyone including present and former patients nurses and other employees such whistleblower actions have been brought against nursing facilities on the basis of the alleged failure of the nursing facility to meet applicable regulations relating to its operations significantly if a claim is successfully adjudicated the federal false claims act provides for treble damages up to 11000 per claim 

  

prosecutions investigations or whistleblower actions could have a material adverse effect on a property operator’s liquidity financial condition and operations which could adversely affect the ability of the operator to meet its financial obligations to us finally various state false claim act and antikickback laws may also apply to each property operator violation of any of the foregoing statutes can result in criminal andor civil penalties that could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its financial obligations to us 

  

other legislative developments including the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” have greatly expanded the definition of health care fraud and related offenses and broadened its scope to include private health care plans in 

 

  

addition to government payors congress also has greatly increased funding for the department of justice federal bureau of investigation and the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services to audit investigate and prosecute suspected health care fraud moreover a significant portion of the billions in health care fraud recoveries over the past several years has also been returned to government agencies to further fund their fraud investigation and prosecution efforts 

  

additionally other hipaa provisions and regulations provide for communication of health information through standard electronic transaction formats and for the privacy and security of health information in order to comply with the regulations health care providers often must undertake significant operational and technical implementation efforts operators also may face significant financial exposure if they fail to maintain the privacy and security of medical records and other personal health information about individuals the health information technology for economic and clinical health “hitech” act passed in february 2009 strengthened the hhs secretary’s authority to impose civil money penalties for hipaa violations occurring after february 18 2009 hitech directs the hhs secretary to provide for periodic audits to ensure covered entities and their business associates as that term is defined under hipaa comply with the applicable hitech requirements increasing the likelihood that a hipaa violation will result in an enforcement action cms issued an interim final rule which conformed hipaa enforcement regulations to the hitech act increasing the maximum penalty for multiple violations of a single requirement or prohibition to 15 million higher penalties may accrue for violations of multiple requirements or prohibitions additionally on january 17 2013 cms released a final rule which expands the applicability of hipaa and hitech and strengthens the government’s ability to enforce these laws the final rule broadens the definition of “business associate” and provides for civil money penalty liability against covered entities and business associates for the acts of their agents regardless of whether a business associate agreement is in place additionally the final rule adopts certain changes to the hipaa enforcement regulations to incorporate the increased and tiered civil monetary penalty structure provided by hitech and makes business associates of covered entities directly liable under hipaa for compliance with certain of the hipaa privacy standards and hipaa security standards hipaa violations are also potentially subject to criminal penalties 

  

in november 2002 cms began an ongoing national nursing home quality initiative “nhqi” under this initiative historical survey information the nhqi pilot evaluation report and the nhqi overview is made available to the public online the nhqi website provides consumer and provider information regarding the quality of care in nursing homes the data allows consumers providers states and researchers to compare quality information that shows how well nursing homes are caring for their residents’ physical and clinical needs the posted nursing home quality measures come from resident assessment data that nursing homes routinely collect on the residents at specified intervals during their stay if the operators of nursing facilities are unable to achieve quality of care ratings that are comparable or superior to those of their competitors they may lose market share to other facilities reducing their revenues and adversely impacting their ability to make rental payments 

  

finally government investigations and enforcement actions brought against the health care industry have increased dramatically over the past several years and are expected to continue some of these enforcement actions represent novel legal theories and expansions in the application of the federal false claims act the costs for an operator of a health care property associated with both defending such enforcement actions and the undertakings in settling these actions can be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its obligations to us

canada 

  

  retirement homes and longterm care facilities are subject to regulation and longterm care facilities receive funding under provincial law there is no federal regulation in this area set out below are summaries of the principal regulatory requirements in the provinces where we have a material number of facilities 

  

  licensing and regulation 

  

  ontario 

  

  longterm care facilities or nursing homes receive government funding are licensed under the longterm care homes act 2007 and are governed by the ministry of health and longterm care the ltc homes act places a strong emphasis on the protection of residents 

  

  retirement homes in ontario are regulated under the retirement homes act 2010 the “act” retirement homes do not receive any government funding residents pay for tenancy and services received at retirement homes residents may access publiclyfunded external care services at the home from funded external suppliers 

  

  a license is required to operate a retirement home licenses must be applied for and are nontransferable applications for licenses are directed to the registrar of the retirement homes regulatory authority rhra all of the homes in which we have an interest in ontario are licensed as retirement homes one of the homes also has some licensed longterm care beds 

  

  licenses can have conditions imposed upon them or can be suspended in circumstances where the operator is found to be in contravention of the act there is no set renewal period for licenses and they terminate according to the terms set out in the license itself or if one of the enumerated triggering mechanisms occurs for example if the operator ceases to have controlling interest in the license 

  

  the licensee of a retirement home must ensure that the care provided by the home meets prescribed standards the act and its regulations include a number of detailed provisions with respect to care standards safety plans in the event of emergency or infectious disease temperature control cleanliness pest control maintenance food preparations risk of resident falls and behavioral management among other things a care plan must be developed for each resident of the home with their consent the act establishes a residents’ bill of rights which provides residents with a list of rights such as the right to participate fully in decisionmaking with respect to care the right not to be restrained and the right to know what care services are provided and their cost the residents’ bill of rights can be enforced as a contract 

  

  the act requires a report to the rhra when any person has reasonable grounds to suspect abuse of a resident by anyone or neglect of a resident by staff following a report to the rhra there is a mandatory inspection carried out by the rhra which results in a report that is posted on the rhra’s public website the most recent report must also be posted in the subject home and be readily available for review if requested thereafter 

  

  the registrar of the rhra has the power to inspect a retirement home at any time without warning or issue a warrant to ensure compliance with the act compliance inspections occur at least every three years the registrar has the power to make a variety of orders including for example the imposition of a fine or an order revoking the operator’s license there is an appeal process in place with respect to orders made by the registrar the act also enumerates offenses such as operating without a license and provides for penalties for offenses 

  

  british columbia 

  

  the community care and assisted living act the residential care regulation and the community care and assisted living regulation together the “bc act” regulate “community care facilities” longterm care facilities in substantially the same manner as retirement homes are regulated under the ontario act the bc act defines such a facility as premises used for the purpose of supervising vulnerable persons who require three or more prescribed services 

  

  the bc act also creates a separate regime for regulating “assisted living residences” which are facilities providing at least one but not more than two prescribed care services assisted living residences are designed for those who can live independently but who require assistance with certain activities unlike community care facilities assisted living residences must be registered with the registrar of assisted living residences but do not require a license nevertheless assisted living residences must be operated in a 

 

  

manner that does not jeopardize the health or safety of its residents if the registrar has reason to believe a residence is not being operated in accordance with this standard the registrar may inspect the assisted living residence and may suspend or cancel a registration most of the residences in which we have an interest in bc are assisted living residences with one being an independent living residence 

  

  independent living residences offer housing and hospitality services for retired adults who are functionally independent and able to direct their own care services available for residents can include for example meals housekeeping monitoring and emergency support social and recreational opportunities and transportation 

  

  québec 

  

  in québec retirement homes are regulated by the act respecting health services and social services the “act” and the regulation respecting the conditions for obtaining a certificate of compliance and the operating standards for a private seniors residence the “regulation” which refer to “private seniors’ residences” private seniors’ residences in québec are required to obtain a certificate of compliance the regulation is currently in the process of being amended 

  

  a certificate of compliance is issued for a period of three years is renewable and can only be validly transferred to another person with the written permission of the regional licensing agency an agency may revoke a temporary certificate or revoke or refuse to issue or renew a certificate of compliance if among other things the operator fails to comply with the act and the regulation although the decision of the applicable agency can be contested before the administrative tribunal of québec the agency may also order the residence to take corrective measures further to an inspection complaint andor investigation the agency is authorized to inspect a residence at any reasonable time of day in order to ascertain whether it complies with the act and the regulation 

  

  private seniors’ residences may belong to either or both of the following two categories those offering services to independent elderly persons and those offering services to semiindependent elderly persons the operator of a residence must for each category comply with the applicable criteria and standards with some exceptions provided for residences with fewer than six or ten rooms or apartments the act and the regulation set out a number of detailed provisions with respect to residents’ health and safety including mandatory callforhelp systems safety plans in the event of fire or infectious disease health assessments permissible control measures as well as administration and distribution of medication meal services and recreation content of residents’ files disclosure of information to residents and staffing requirements among other things 

  

  other related laws 

  

  privacy 

  

  we are generally subject to privacy legislation in canada including in certain provinces privacy laws specifically related to personal health information although the obligations of custodians of personal health information in the various provinces differ to some extent they all include the obligation to protect the information privacy laws in canada are consentbased and require the implementation of a privacy program involving policies procedures and the designation of an individual or team with primary responsibility for a custodian’s privacy law compliance mandatory breach notification is a requirement under some laws some laws require notification where personal health informationpersonal information is processed or stored outside of canada one provincial law in quebec provides for fines where an organization fails to perform required due diligence before outsourcing activities involving personal information to a service provider outside of the province 

  

  some privacy regulators in canada have ordermaking authority and others are ombudspersons who make recommendations that may only be enforced by a court under a number of privacy laws a finding by a regulator that a custodian has breached the law creates a right to apply to a court for money damages in some provinces there is a statutory civil cause of action for breach of privacy in other provinces the courts have recognized a limited common law cause of action for breach of privacy 

  

  the powers of privacy regulators and penalties for violations of privacy law vary according to the applicable law or are left to the courts generally penalties are monetary in nature private rights of action may also be available and regulators have the authority to make public the identity of a health information custodian that has been found to have committed a breach so that there is a reputational risk associated with privacy law violations even where there are no monetary damages incurred the notification of patients mandatory under some privacy laws and other activities required to manage a privacy breach can give rise to significant costs 

  

  other legislation 

  

 

  

  retirement homes may be subject to residential tenancy laws such that there can be restrictions on rent increases and termination of tenancies for instance other provincial legislation applicable to occupational health and safety public health and the provision of community health care and funded longterm careskilled nursing may also apply to retirement homes in addition municipal laws with respect to matters such as fire safety food services and zoning would also apply

general 

  

we elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust a “reit” commencing with our first taxable year we intend to continue to operate in such a manner as to qualify as a reit but there is no guarantee that we will qualify or remain qualified as a reit for subsequent years qualification and taxation as a reit depends upon our ability to meet a variety of qualification tests imposed under federal income tax law with respect to income assets distribution level and diversity of share ownership as discussed below under “— qualification as a reit” there can be no assurance that we will be owned and organized and will operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified 

  

in any year in which we qualify as a reit in general we will not be subject to federal income tax on that portion of our reit taxable income or capital gain that is distributed to stockholders we may however be subject to tax at normal corporate rates on any taxable income or capital gain not distributed if we elect to retain and pay income tax on our net longterm capital gains stockholders are required to include their proportionate share of our undistributed longterm capital gains in income but they will receive a refundable credit for their share of any taxes paid by us on such gain 

  

despite the reit election we may be subject to federal income and excise tax as follows 

  

• to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our “reit taxable income” as adjusted we will be subject to tax on the undistributed amount at regular corporate tax rates 

  

• we may be subject to the “alternative minimum tax” the “amt” on certain tax preference items to the extent that the amt exceeds our regular tax 

  

• if we have net income from the sale or other disposition of “foreclosure property” that is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business or other nonqualifying income from foreclosure property such income will be taxed at the highest corporate rate 

  

• any net income from prohibited transactions which are in general sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business other than dispositions of foreclosure property and dispositions of property due to an involuntary conversion will be subject to a 100 tax 

  

• if we fail to satisfy either the 75 or 95 gross income tests as discussed below but nonetheless maintain our qualification as a reit because certain other requirements are met we will be subject to a 100 tax on an amount equal to 1 the gross 

 

  

income attributable to the greater of i 75 of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75 gross income test discussed below or ii 95 of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 95 gross income test discussed below multiplied by 2 a fraction intended to reflect our profitability 

  

• if we fail to distribute during each year at least the sum of 1 85 of our reit ordinary income for the year 2 95 of our reit capital gain net income for such year other than capital gain that we elect to retain and pay tax on and 3 any undistributed taxable income from preceding periods we will be subject to a 4 excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over amounts actually distributed 

  

• we will be subject to a 100 tax on the amount of any rents from real property deductions or excess interest paid to us by any of our “taxable reit subsidiaries” that would be reduced through reallocation under certain federal income tax principles in order to more clearly reflect income of the taxable reit subsidiary see “— qualification as a reit — investments in taxable reit subsidiaries” and 

  

• we may be subject to the corporate “alternative minimum tax” on any items of tax preference including any deductions of net operating losses 

  

if we acquire any assets from a corporation which is or has been a “c” corporation in a carryover basis transaction we could be liable for specified liabilities that are inherited from the “c” corporation a “c” corporation is generally defined as a corporation that is required to pay full corporate level federal income tax if we recognize gain on the disposition of the assets during the tenyear period beginning on the date on which the assets were acquired by us then to the extent of the assets’ “builtin gain” ie the excess of the fair market value of the asset over the adjusted tax basis in the asset in each case determined as of the beginning of the tenyear period we will be subject to tax on the gain at the highest regular corporate rate applicable the results described in this paragraph with respect to the recognition of builtin gain assume that the builtin gain assets at the time the builtin gain assets were subject to a conversion transaction either where a “c” corporation elected reit status or a reit acquired the assets from a “c” corporation were not treated as sold to an unrelated party and gain recognized for those properties that are subject to the builtingains tax if triggered by a sale within the tenyear period beginning on the date on which the properties were acquired by us then the potential amount of builtingains tax will be an additional factor when considering a possible sale of the properties see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the builtin gains tax 

  

qualification as a reit 

  

a reit is defined as a corporation trust or association 

  

1 which is managed by one or more trustees or directors 

  

2 the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest 

  

3 which would be taxable as a domestic corporation but for the federal income tax law relating to reits 

  

4 which is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company 

  

5 the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons in each taxable year of the reit except for its first taxable year 

  

6 not more than 50 in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned during the last half of each taxable year excluding its first taxable year directly or indirectly by or for five or fewer individuals which includes certain entities the “five or fewer requirement” and 

  

7 which meets certain income and asset tests described below 

  

conditions 1 to 4 inclusive must be met during the entire taxable year and condition 5 must be met during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months for purposes of conditions 5 and 6 pension funds and certain other taxexempt entities are treated as individuals subject to a “lookthrough” exception in the case of condition 6 

  

based on publicly available information we believe we have satisfied the share ownership requirements set forth in 5 and 6 above in addition article vi of our bylaws provides for restrictions regarding ownership and transfer of shares these 

 

  

restrictions are intended to assist us in continuing to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in 5 and 6 above these restrictions however may not ensure that we will in all cases be able to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in 5 and 6 above 

  

we have complied with and will continue to comply with regulatory rules to send annual letters to certain of our stockholders requesting information regarding the actual ownership of our stock if despite sending the annual letters we do not know or after exercising reasonable diligence would not have known whether we failed to meet the five or fewer requirement we will be treated as having met the five or fewer requirement if we fail to comply with these regulatory rules we will be subject to a monetary penalty if our failure to comply was due to intentional disregard of the requirement the penalty would be increased however if our failure to comply were due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect no penalty would be imposed 

  

we may own a number of properties through wholly owned subsidiaries a corporation will qualify as a “qualified reit subsidiary” if 100 of its stock is owned by a reit and the reit does not elect to treat the subsidiary as a taxable reit subsidiary a “qualified reit subsidiary” will not be treated as a separate corporation and all assets liabilities and items of income deductions and credits of a “qualified reit subsidiary” will be treated as assets liabilities and items as the case may be of the reit a “qualified reit subsidiary” is not subject to federal income tax and our ownership of the voting stock of a qualified reit subsidiary will not violate the restrictions against ownership of securities of any one issuer which constitute more than 10 of the value or total voting power of such issuer or more than 5 of the value of our total assets as described below under “— asset tests” 

  

if we invest in a partnership a limited liability company or a trust taxed as a partnership or as a disregarded entity we will be deemed to own a proportionate share of the partnership’s limited liability company’s or trust’s assets likewise we will be treated as receiving our share of the income and loss of the partnership limited liability company or trust and the gross income will retain the same character in our hands as it has in the hands of the partnership limited liability company or trust these “lookthrough” rules apply for purposes of the income tests and assets tests described below 

  

income tests there are two separate percentage tests relating to our sources of gross income that we must satisfy for each taxable year 

  

• at least 75 of our gross income excluding gross income from certain sales of property held primarily for sale must be directly or indirectly derived each taxable year from “rents from real property” other income from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property or certain income from qualified temporary investments 

  

• at least 95 of our gross income excluding gross income from certain sales of property held primarily for sale must be directly or indirectly derived each taxable year from any of the sources qualifying for the 75 gross income test and from dividends including dividends from taxable reit subsidiaries and interest 

  

as to transactions entered into in taxable years beginning after october 22 2004 and on or prior to july 30 2008 any of our income from a “clearly identified” hedging transaction that is entered into by us in the normal course of business directly or indirectly to manage the risk of interest rate movements price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings or obligations incurred or to be incurred by us or such other risks that are prescribed by the internal revenue service is excluded from the 95 gross income test 

  

for transactions entered into after july 30 2008 any of our income from a “clearly identified” hedging transaction that is entered into by us in the normal course of business directly or indirectly to manage the risk of interest rate movements price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings or obligations incurred or to be incurred by us is excluded from the 95 and 75 gross income tests 

  

for transactions entered into after july 30 2008 any of our income from a “clearly identified” hedging transaction entered into by us primarily to manage risk of currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain that is included in gross income in the 95 and 75 gross income tests is excluded from the 95 and 75 gross income tests 

  

in general a hedging transaction is “clearly identified” if 1 the transaction is identified as a hedging transaction before the end of the day on which it is entered into and 2 the items or risks being hedged are identified “substantially contemporaneously” with the hedging transaction an identification is not substantially contemporaneous if it is made more than 35 days after entering into the hedging transaction 

  

as to gains and items of income recognized after july 30 2008 “passive foreign exchange gain” for any taxable year will not constitute gross income for purposes of the 95 gross income test and “real estate foreign exchange gain” for any taxable year will 

 

  

not constitute gross income for purposes of the 75 gross income test real estate foreign exchange gain is foreign currency gain as defined in internal revenue code section 988b1 which is attributable to i any qualifying item of income or gain for purposes of the 75 gross income test ii the acquisition or ownership of obligations secured by mortgages on real property or interests in real property or iii becoming or being the obligor under obligations secured by mortgages on real property or on interests in real property real estate foreign exchange gain also includes internal revenue code section 987 gain attributable to a qualified business unit a “qbu” of a reit if the qbu itself meets the 75 gross income test for the taxable year and the 75 asset test at the close of each quarter that the reit has directly or indirectly held the qbu real estate foreign exchange gain also includes any other foreign currency gain as determined by the secretary of the treasury passive foreign exchange gain includes all real estate foreign exchange gain and foreign currency gain which is attributable to i any qualifying item of income or gain for purposes of the 95 gross income test ii the acquisition or ownership of obligations iii becoming or being the obligor under obligations and iv any other foreign currency gain as determined by the secretary of the treasury 

  

generally other than income from “clearly identified” hedging transactions entered into by us in the normal course of business any foreign currency gain derived by us from dealing or engaging in substantial and regular trading in securities will constitute gross income which does not qualify under the 95 or 75 gross income tests 

  

rents received by us will qualify as “rents from real property” for purposes of satisfying the gross income tests for a reit only if several conditions are met 

  

• the amount of rent must not be based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person although rents generally will not be excluded merely because they are based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales 

  

• rents received from a tenant will not qualify as rents from real property if the reit or an owner of 10 or more of the reit also directly or constructively owns 10 or more of the tenant unless the tenant is our taxable reit subsidiary and certain other requirements are met with respect to the real property being rented 

  

• if rent attributable to personal property leased in connection with a lease of real property is greater than 15 of the total rent received under the lease then the portion of rent attributable to such personal property will not qualify as “rents from real property” 

  

• for rents to qualify as rents from real property we generally must not furnish or render services to tenants other than through a taxable reit subsidiary or an “independent contractor” from whom we derive no income except that we may directly provide services that are “usually or customarily rendered” in the geographic area in which the property is located in connection with the rental of real property for occupancy only or are not otherwise considered “rendered to the occupant for his convenience” 

  

• for taxable years beginning after july 30 2008 the reit may lease “ qualified health care properties” on an arm’slength basis to a taxable reit subsidiary if the property is operated on behalf of such subsidiary by a person who qualifies as an “independent contractor” and who is or is related to a person who is actively engaged in the trade or business of operating health care facilities for any person unrelated to us or our taxable reit subsidiary an “ eligible independent contractor  ” generally the rent that the reit receives from the taxable reit subsidiary will be treated as “rents from real property”   a “qualified health care property” includes any real property and any personal property that is or is necessary or incidental to the use of a hospital nursing facility assisted living facility congregate care facility qualified continuing care facility or other licensed facility that extends medical or nursing or ancillary services to patients and is operated by a provider of such services that is eligible for participation in the medicare program with respect to such facility 

  

a reit is permitted to render a de minimis amount of impermissible services to tenants and still treat amounts received with respect to that property as rent from real property the amount received or accrued by the reit during the taxable year for the impermissible services with respect to a property may not exceed 1 of all amounts received or accrued by the reit directly or indirectly from the property the amount received for any service or management operation for this purpose shall be deemed to be not less than 150 of the direct cost of the reit in furnishing or rendering the service or providing the management or operation furthermore impermissible services may be furnished to tenants by a taxable reit subsidiary subject to certain conditions and we may still treat rents received with respect to the property as rent from real property 

  

the term “interest” generally does not include any amount if the determination of the amount depends in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person although an amount generally will not be excluded from the term “interest” solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage of receipts or sales 

  

 

  

if we fail to satisfy one or both of the 75 or 95 gross income tests for any taxable year we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for such year if we are eligible for relief these relief provisions generally will be available if 1 following our identification of the failure we file a schedule for such taxable year describing each item of our gross income and 2 the failure to meet such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect 

  

it is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions if these relief provisions apply a 100 tax is imposed on an amount equal to a the gross income attributable to 1 75 of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75 income test and 2 95 of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 95 income test multiplied by b a fraction intended to reflect our profitability 

  

the secretary of the treasury is given broad authority to determine whether particular items of income or gain qualify or not under the 75 and 95 gross income tests or are to be excluded from the measure of gross income for such purposes 

  

asset tests within 30 days after the close of each quarter of our taxable year we must also satisfy several tests relating to the nature and diversification of our assets determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles at least 75 of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets cash cash items including receivables arising in the ordinary course of our operation government securities and qualified temporary investments although the remaining 25 of our assets generally may be invested without restriction we are prohibited from owning securities representing more than 10 of either the vote the “10 vote test” or value the “10 value test” of the outstanding securities of any issuer other than a qualified reit subsidiary another reit or a taxable reit subsidiary further no more than 25 of the total assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries the “25 asset test” and no more than 5 of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities of any nongovernmental issuer other than a qualified reit subsidiary the “5 asset test” another reit or a taxable reit subsidiary each of the 10 vote test the 10 value test and the 25 and 5 asset tests must be satisfied at the end of each quarter there are special rules which provide relief if the value related tests are not satisfied due to changes in the value of the assets of a reit 

  

certain items are excluded from the 10 value test including 1 straight debt securities as defined in internal revenue code section 1361c5 of an issuer including straight debt that provides certain contingent payments 2 any loan to an individual or an estate 3 any rental agreement described in section 467 of the internal revenue code other than with a “related person” 4 any obligation to pay rents from real property 5 certain securities issued by a state or any subdivision thereof the district of columbia a foreign government or any political subdivision thereof or the commonwealth of puerto rico 6 any security issued by a reit and 7 any other arrangement that as determined by the secretary of the treasury is excepted from the definition of security “excluded securities” special rules apply to straight debt securities issued by corporations and entities taxable as partnerships for federal income tax purposes if a reit or its taxable reit subsidiary holds 1 straight debt securities of a corporate or partnership issuer and 2 securities of such issuer that are not excluded securities and have an aggregate value greater than 1 of such issuer’s outstanding securities the straight debt securities will be included in the 10 value test 

  

a reit’s interest as a partner in a partnership is not treated as a security for purposes of applying the 10 value test to securities issued by the partnership further any debt instrument issued by a partnership will not be a security for purposes of applying the 10 value test 1 to the extent of the reit’s interest as a partner in the partnership and 2 if at least 75 of the partnership’s gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions would qualify for the 75 gross income test for purposes of the 10 value test a reit’s interest in a partnership’s assets is determined by the reit’s proportionate interest in any securities issued by the partnership other than the excluded securities described in the preceding paragraph 

  

for taxable years beginning after july 30 2008 if the reit or its qbu uses a foreign currency as its functional currency the term “cash” includes such foreign currency but only to the extent such foreign currency is i held for use in the normal course of the activities of the reit or qbu which give rise to items of income or gain that are included in the 95 and 75 gross income tests or are directly related to acquiring or holding assets qualifying under the 75 asset test and ii not held in connection with dealing or engaging in substantial and regular trading in securities 

  

with respect to corrections of failures as to violations of the 10 vote test the 10 value test or the 5 asset test a reit may avoid disqualification as a reit by disposing of sufficient assets to cure a violation that does not exceed the lesser of 1 of the reit’s assets at the end of the relevant quarter or 10000000 provided that the disposition occurs within six months following the last day of the quarter in which the reit first identified the assets for violations of any of the reit asset tests due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that exceed the thresholds described in the preceding sentence a reit can avoid disqualification as a reit after the close of a taxable quarter by taking certain steps including disposition of sufficient assets within the six month period described above to meet the applicable asset test paying a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets during the period of time that the assets were held as nonqualifying assets and filing a schedule with the internal revenue service that describes the nonqualifying assets 

  

 

  

investments in taxable reit subsidiaries   reits may own more than 10 of the voting power and value of securities in taxable reit subsidiaries we and any taxable corporate entity in which we own an interest are allowed to jointly elect to treat such entity as a “taxable reit subsidiary” 

  

certain of our subsidiaries have elected to be treated as a taxable reit subsidiary taxable reit subsidiaries are subject to full corporate level federal taxation on their earnings but are permitted to engage in certain types of activities that cannot be performed directly by reits without jeopardizing their reit status our taxable reit subsidiaries will attempt to minimize the amount of these taxes but there can be no assurance whether or the extent to which measures taken to minimize taxes will be successful to the extent our taxable reit subsidiaries are required to pay federal state or local taxes the cash available for distribution as dividends to us from our taxable reit subsidiaries will be reduced 

  

the amount of interest on relatedparty debt that a taxable reit subsidiary may deduct is limited further a 100 tax applies to any interest payments by a taxable reit subsidiary to its affiliated reit to the extent the interest rate is not commercially reasonable a taxable reit subsidiary is permitted to deduct interest payments to unrelated parties without any of these restrictions 

  

the internal revenue service may reallocate costs between a reit and its taxable reit subsidiary where there is a lack of arm’slength dealing between the parties any deductible expenses allocated away from a taxable reit subsidiary would increase its tax liability further any amount by which a reit understates its deductions and overstates those of its taxable reit subsidiary may subject to certain exceptions be subject to a 100 tax additional taxable reit subsidiary elections may be made in the future for additional entities in which we obtain an interest 

  

annual distribution requirements in order to avoid being taxed as a regular corporation we are required to make distributions other than capital gain distributions to our stockholders which qualify for the dividends paid deduction in an amount at least equal to 1 the sum of i 90 of our “reit taxable income” computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain and ii 90 of the aftertax net income if any from foreclosure property minus 2 a portion of certain items of noncash income these distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for that year and if paid on or before the first regular distribution payment after such declaration the amount distributed must not be preferential this means that every stockholder of the class of stock to which a distribution is made must be treated the same as every other stockholder of that class and no class of stock may be treated otherwise than in accordance with its dividend rights as a class to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our “reit taxable income” as adjusted we will be subject to tax on the undistributed amount at regular corporate tax rates as discussed above we may be subject to an excise tax if we fail to meet certain other distribution requirements we believe we have satisfied the annual distribution requirements for the year of our initial reit election and each year thereafter through the year ended december 31 2013 although we intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy these annual distribution requirements for subsequent years economic market legal tax or other factors could limit our ability to meet those requirements see “item 1a — risk factors” 

  

it is also possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90 distribution requirement or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation due to among other things 1 timing differences between i the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses and ii the inclusion of income and deduction of expenses in arriving at our taxable income or 2 the payment of severance benefits that may not be deductible to us in the event that timing differences occur we may find it necessary to arrange for borrowings or if possible pay dividends in the form of taxable stock dividends in order to meet the distribution requirement 

  

under certain circumstances in the event of a deficiency determined by the internal revenue service we may be able to rectify a resulting failure to meet the distribution requirement for a year by paying “deficiency dividends” to stockholders in a later year which may be included in our deduction for distributions paid for the earlier year thus we may be able to avoid being taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends however we will be required to pay applicable penalties and interest based upon the amount of any deduction taken for deficiency dividend distributions 

  

  failure to qualify as a reit 

  

if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates distributions to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify as a reit will not be deductible nor will any particular amount of distributions be required to be made in any year all distributions to stockholders will be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these distributions and subject to certain limitations will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporate stockholders unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions we also will be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we 

 

  

would be entitled to statutory relief failure to qualify for even one year could result in our need to incur indebtedness or liquidate investments in order to pay potentially significant resulting tax liabilities 

  

in addition to the relief described above under “— income tests” and “— asset tests” relief is available in the event that we violate a provision of the internal revenue code that would result in our failure to qualify as a reit if 1 the violation is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect 2 we pay a penalty of 50000 for each failure to satisfy the provision and 3 the violation does not include a violation described under “— income tests” or “— asset tests” above it is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions 

  

federal income taxation of holders of our stock 

  

treatment of taxable us stockholders the following summary applies to you only if you are a “us stockholder” a “us stockholder” is a holder of shares of stock who for united states federal income tax purposes is 

  

• a citizen or resident of the united states 

  

• a corporation partnership or other entity classified as a corporation or partnership for these purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the united states or of any political subdivision of the united states including any state 

  

• an estate the income of which is subject to united states federal income taxation regardless of its source or 

  

• a trust if in general a us court is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or more us persons within the meaning of the internal revenue code has the authority to control all of the trust’s substantial decisions 

  

so long as we qualify for taxation as a reit distributions on shares of our stock made out of the current or accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these distributions and not designated as capital gain dividends will be includable as ordinary income for federal income tax purposes none of these distributions will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for us corporate stockholders 

  

generally for taxable years following the year ended december 31 2013 the maximum marginal rate of tax payable by individuals on dividends received from corporations that are subject to a corporate level of tax is 20 except in limited circumstances this tax rate will not apply to dividends paid to you by us on our shares because generally we are not subject to federal income tax on the portion of our reit taxable income or capital gains distributed to our stockholders the reduced maximum federal income tax rate will apply to that portion if any of dividends received by you with respect to our shares that are attributable to 1 dividends received by us from nonreit corporations or other taxable reit subsidiaries 2 income from the prior year with respect to which we were required to pay federal corporate income tax during the prior year if for example we did not distribute 100 of our reit taxable income for the prior year or 3 the amount of any earnings and profits that were distributed by us and accumulated in a nonreit year 

  

distributions that are designated as capital gain dividends will be taxed as longterm capital gains to the extent they do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year without regard to the period for which you held our stock however if you are a corporation you may be required to treat a portion of some capital gain dividends as ordinary income 

  

if we elect to retain and pay income tax on any net longterm capital gain you would include in income as longterm capital gain your proportionate share of this net longterm capital gain you would also receive a refundable tax credit for your proportionate share of the tax paid by us on such retained capital gains and you would have an increase in the basis of your shares of our stock in an amount equal to your includable capital gains less your share of the tax deemed paid 

  

you may not include in your federal income tax return any of our net operating losses or capital losses federal income tax rules may also require that certain minimum tax adjustments and preferences be apportioned to you in addition any distribution declared by us in october november or december of any year on a specified date in any such month shall be treated as both paid by us and received by you on december 31 of that year provided that the distribution is actually paid by us no later than january 31 of the following year 

  

we will be treated as having sufficient earnings and profits to treat as a dividend any distribution up to the amount required to be distributed in order to avoid imposition of the 4 excise tax discussed under “— general” and “— qualification as a reit — annual distribution requirements” above as a result you may be required to treat as taxable dividends certain distributions that would 

 

  

otherwise result in a taxfree return of capital moreover any “deficiency dividend” will be treated as a dividend an ordinary dividend or a capital gain dividend as the case may be regardless of our earnings and profits any other distributions in excess of current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to you to the extent these distributions do not exceed the adjusted tax basis of your shares of our stock you will be required to reduce the tax basis of your shares of our stock by the amount of these distributions until the basis has been reduced to zero after which these distributions will be taxable as capital gain if the shares of our stock are held as capital assets the tax basis as so reduced will be used in computing the capital gain or loss if any realized upon sale of the shares of our stock any loss upon a sale or exchange of shares of our stock which were held for six months or less after application of certain holding period rules will generally be treated as a longterm capital loss to the extent you previously received capital gain distributions with respect to these shares of our stock 

  

upon the sale or exchange of any shares of our stock to or with a person other than us or a sale or exchange of all shares of our stock whether actually or constructively owned with us you will generally recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your adjusted tax basis in these shares of our stock this gain will be capital gain if you held these shares of our stock as a capital asset 

  

if we redeem any of your shares in us the treatment can only be determined on the basis of particular facts at the time of redemption in general you will recognize gain or loss as opposed to dividend income equal to the difference between the amount received by you in the redemption and your adjusted tax basis in your shares redeemed if such redemption 1 results in a “complete termination” of your interest in all classes of our equity securities 2 is a “substantially disproportionate redemption” or 3 is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” with respect to you in applying these tests you must take into account your ownership of all classes of our equity securities eg common stock preferred stock depositary shares and warrants you also must take into account any equity securities that are considered to be constructively owned by you 

  

if as a result of a redemption by us of your shares you no longer own either actually or constructively any of our equity securities or only own actually and constructively an insubstantial percentage of our equity securities then it is probable that the redemption of your shares would be considered “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” and thus would result in gain or loss to you however whether a distribution is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” depends on all of the facts and circumstances and if you rely on any of these tests at the time of redemption you should consult your tax advisor to determine their application to the particular situation 

  

generally if the redemption does not meet the tests described above then the proceeds received by you from the redemption of your shares will be treated as a distribution taxable as a dividend to the extent of the allocable portion of current or accumulated earnings and profits if the redemption is taxed as a dividend your adjusted tax basis in the redeemed shares will be transferred to any other shareholdings in us that you own if you own no other shareholdings in us under certain circumstances such basis may be transferred to a related person or it may be lost entirely 

  

gain from the sale or exchange of our shares held for more than one year is generally taxed at a maximum longterm capital gain rate of 20 in the case of stockholders who are individuals and 35 in the case of stockholders that are corporations pursuant to internal revenue service guidance we may classify portions of our capital gain dividends as gains eligible for the longterm capital gains rate or as gain taxable to individual stockholders at a maximum rate of 25 capital losses recognized by a stockholder upon the disposition of our shares held for more than one year at the time of disposition will be considered long term capital losses and are generally available only to offset capital gain income of the stockholder but not ordinary income except in the case of individuals who may offset up to 3000 of ordinary income each year 

  

an additional tax of 38 generally will be imposed on the “net investment income” of us stockholders who meet certain requirements and are individuals estates or certain trusts for taxable years beginning after december 31 2012 among other items “net investment income” generally includes gross income from dividends and net gain attributable to the disposition of certain property such as shares of our common stock or warrants in the case of individuals this tax will only apply to the extent such individual’s modified adjusted gross income exceeds 200000 250000 for married couples filing a joint return and surviving spouses and 125000 for married individuals filing a separate return us stockholders should consult their tax advisors regarding the possible applicability of this additional tax in their particular circumstances 

  

treatment of taxexempt us stockholders taxexempt entities including qualified employee pension and profit sharing trusts and individual retirement accounts “exempt organizations” generally are exempt from federal income taxation however they are subject to taxation on their unrelated business taxable income “ubti” the internal revenue service has issued a published revenue ruling that dividend distributions from a reit to an exempt employee pension trust do not constitute ubti provided that the shares of the reit are not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business of the exempt employee pension trust based on this ruling amounts distributed by us to exempt organizations generally should not constitute ubti however if an exempt organization finances its acquisition of the shares of our stock with debt a portion of its income from us will constitute ubti pursuant to the “debt 

 

  

financed property” rules likewise a portion of the exempt organization’s income from us would constitute ubti if we held a residual interest in a real estate mortgage investment conduit 

  

in addition in certain circumstances a pension trust that owns more than 10 of our stock is required to treat a percentage of our dividends as ubti this rule applies to a pension trust holding more than 10 of our stock only if 1 the percentage of our income that is ubti determined as if we were a pension trust is at least 5 2 we qualify as a reit by reason of the modification of the five or fewer requirement that allows beneficiaries of the pension trust to be treated as holding shares in proportion to their actuarial interests in the pension trust and 3 either i one pension trust owns more than 25 of the value of our stock or ii a group of pension trusts individually holding more than 10 of the value of our stock collectively own more than 50 of the value of our stock 

  

backup withholding and information reporting under certain circumstances you may be subject to backup withholding at applicable rates on payments made with respect to or cash proceeds of a sale or exchange of shares of our stock backup withholding will apply only if you 1 fail to provide a correct taxpayer identification number which if you are an individual is ordinarily your social security number 2 furnish an incorrect taxpayer identification number 3 are notified by the internal revenue service that you have failed to properly report payments of interest or dividends or 4 fail to certify under penalties of perjury that you have furnished a correct taxpayer identification number and that the internal revenue service has not notified you that you are subject to backup withholding 

  

backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients such as corporations and taxexempt organizations you should consult with a tax advisor regarding qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining an exemption backup withholding is not an additional tax rather the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a stockholder will be allowed as a credit against such stockholder’s united states federal income tax liability and may entitle such stockholder to a refund provided that the required information is provided to the internal revenue service in addition withholding a portion of capital gain distributions made to stockholders may be required for stockholders who fail to certify their nonforeign status 

  

taxation of foreign stockholders the following summary applies to you only if you are a foreign person the federal taxation of foreign persons is a highly complex matter that may be affected by many considerations 

  

except as discussed below distributions to you of cash generated by our real estate operations in the form of ordinary dividends but not by the sale or exchange of our capital assets generally will be subject to us withholding tax at a rate of 30 unless an applicable tax treaty reduces that tax and you file with us the required form evidencing the lower rate 

  

in general you will be subject to united states federal income tax on a graduated rate basis rather than withholding with respect to your investment in our stock if such investment is “effectively connected” with your conduct of a trade or business in the united states a corporate foreign stockholder that receives income that is or is treated as effectively connected with a united states trade or business may also be subject to the branch profits tax which is payable in addition to regular united states corporate income tax the following discussion will apply to foreign stockholders whose investment in us is not so effectively connected we expect to withhold united states income tax as described below on the gross amount of any distributions paid to you unless 1 you file an internal revenue service form w8eci with us claiming that the distribution is “effectively connected” or 2 certain other exceptions apply

 item 1a risk factors 

  

this section discusses the most significant factors that affect our business operations and financial condition it does not describe all risks and uncertainties applicable to us our industry or ownership of our securities if any of the following risks as well as other risks and uncertainties that are not yet identified or that we currently think are not material actually occur we could be materially adversely affected in that event the value of our securities could decline 

  

we group these risk factors into three categories 

  

•   risks arising from our business 

  

•   risks arising from our capital structure and 

  

•   risks arising from our status as a reit 

  

risks arising from our business 

  

our investments in and acquisitions of health care and seniors housing properties may be unsuccessful or fail to meet our expectations 

  

we are exposed to the risk that some of our acquisitions may not prove to be successful we could encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired properties including contingent liabilities and acquired properties might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business if we agree to provide construction funding to an operatortenant and the project is not completed we may need to take steps to ensure completion of the project such expenditures may negatively affect our results of operations furthermore there can be no assurance that our anticipated acquisitions and investments the completion of which is subject to various conditions will be consummated in accordance with anticipated timing on anticipated terms or at all we also may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties into our existing operations and this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

 

  

our investments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by our lack of exclusive control over these investments our partners’ insolvency or failure to meet its obligations and disputes between us and our partners 

  

we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into partnerships or joint ventures with other persons or entities joint venture investments involve risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership including the possibility that our partner might become insolvent refuse to make capital contributions when due or otherwise fail to meet its obligations which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments that our partner might at any time have economic or other business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our interests or goals that we could become engaged in a dispute with our partner which could require us to expend additional resources to resolve such disputes and could have an adverse impact on the operations and profitability of the joint venture and that our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests in addition our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted in some instances we andor our partner may have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partner’s interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction our ability to acquire our partner’s interest may be limited if we do not have sufficient cash available borrowing capacity or other capital resources in such event we may be forced to sell our interest in the joint venture when we would otherwise prefer to retain it joint ventures may require us to share decisionmaking authority with our partners which could limit our ability to control the properties in the joint ventures even when we have a controlling interest certain major decisions may require partner approval such as the sale acquisition or financing of a property 

  

we are exposed to operational risks with respect to our seniors housing operating properties that could adversely affect our revenue and operations 

  

we are exposed to various operational risks with respect to our seniors housing operating properties that may increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to generate revenues these risks include fluctuations in occupancy medicare and medicaid reimbursement if applicable and private pay rates economic conditions competition federal state local and industryregulated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards the availability and increases in cost of general and professional liability insurance coverage state regulation and rights of residents related to entrance fees and the availability and increases in the cost of labor as a result of unionization or otherwise any one or a combination of these factors may adversely affect our revenue and operations 

  

decreases in our operators’ revenues or increases in our operators’ expenses could affect our operators’ ability to make payments to us 

  

our operators’ revenues are primarily driven by occupancy private pay rates and medicare and medicaid reimbursement if applicable expenses for these facilities are primarily driven by the costs of labor food utilities taxes insurance and rent or debt service revenues from government reimbursement have and may continue to come under pressure due to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls operating costs continue to increase for our operators to the extent that any decrease in revenues andor any increase in operating expenses result in a property not generating enough cash to make payments to us the credit of our operator and the value of other collateral would have to be relied upon to the extent the value of such property is reduced we may need to record an impairment for such asset furthermore if we determine to dispose of an underperforming property such sale may result in a loss any such impairment or loss on sale would negatively affect our financial results 

  

the continued weakened economy may also have an adverse effect on our operators and tenants including their ability to access credit or maintain occupancy andor private pay rates if the operations cash flows or financial condition of our operators are materially adversely impacted by economic conditions our revenue and operations may be adversely affected 

  

increased competition may affect our operators’ ability to meet their obligations to us 

  

the operators of our properties compete on a local and regional basis with operators of properties and other health care providers that provide comparable services we cannot be certain that the operators of all of our facilities will be able to achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us our operators are expected to encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to attract residents or expand their businesses 

  

the insolvency or bankruptcy of our obligors may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we are exposed to the risk that our obligors may not be able to meet the rent principal and interest or other payments due us which may result in an obligor bankruptcy or insolvency or that an obligor might become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings for other reasons although our operating lease agreements provide us with the right to evict a tenant demand immediate 

 

  

payment of rent and exercise other remedies and our loans provide us with the right to terminate any funding obligation demand immediate repayment of principal and unpaid interest foreclose on the collateral and exercise other remedies the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization an obligor in bankruptcy or subject to insolvency proceedings may be able to limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent in the case of a lease or to receive unpaid principal and interest in the case of a loan and to exercise other rights and remedies 

  

we may be required to fund certain expenses eg real estate taxes and maintenance to preserve the value of an investment property avoid the imposition of liens on a property andor transition a property to a new tenant in some instances we have terminated our lease with a tenant and relet the property to another tenant in some of those situations we have provided working capital loans to and limited indemnification of the new obligor if we cannot transition a leased property to a new tenant we may take possession of that property which may expose us to certain successor liabilities should such events occur our revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely affected 

  

we may not be able to timely reinvest our sale proceeds on terms acceptable to us 

  

from time to time we will have cash available from 1 the proceeds of sales of our securities 2 principal payments on our loans receivable and 3 the sale of properties including nonelective dispositions under the terms of master leases or similar financial support arrangements in order to maintain current revenues and continue generating attractive returns we expect to reinvest these proceeds in a timely manner we compete for real estate investments with a broad variety of potential investors this competition for attractive investments may negatively affect our ability to make timely investments on terms acceptable to us 

  

failure to properly manage our rapid growth could distract our management or increase our expenses 

  

we have experienced rapid growth and development in a relatively short period of time and expect to continue this rapid growth in the future this growth has resulted in increased levels of responsibility for our management future property acquisitions could place significant additional demands on and require us to expand our management resources and personnel our failure to manage any such rapid growth effectively could harm our business and in particular our financial condition results of operations and cash flows which could negatively affect our ability to make distributions to stockholders our growth could also increase our capital requirements which may require us to issue potentially dilutive equity securities and incur additional debt 

  

we depend on genesis healthcare llc “genesis” for a significant portion of our revenues and any inability or unwillingness by genesis to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us could adversely affect us 

  

the properties we lease to genesis account for a significant portion of our revenues and because our leases with genesis are triplenet leases we also depend on genesis to pay all insurance taxes utilities and maintenance and repair expenses in connection with the leased properties we cannot assure you that genesis will have sufficient assets income and access to financing to enable it to make rental payments to us or to otherwise satisfy its obligations under our leases and any inability or unwillingness by genesis to do so could have an adverse effect on us genesis has also agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with its business and we cannot assure you that genesis will have sufficient assets income access to financing and insurance coverage to enable it to satisfy its indemnification obligations 

  

the properties managed by sunrise senior living llc account for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income and any adverse developments in its business or financial condition could adversely affect us 

  

sunrise senior living llc manages our entire sunrise property portfolio which as of december 31 2013 consisted of 125 seniors housing properties these properties account for a significant portion of our revenues and we rely on sunrise senior living llc to manage these properties efficiently and effectively any adverse developments in sunrise senior living llc’s business or financial condition could impair its ability to manage our properties efficiently and effectively which could adversely affect us 

  

ownership of property outside the united states may subject us to different or greater risks than those associated with our domestic operations 

  

we have operations in canada and the united kingdom international development ownership and operating activities involve risks that are different from those we face with respect to our domestic properties and operations these risks include but are not limited to any international currency gain recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates may not qualify under the 75 gross income test or the 95 gross income test that we must satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a reit challenges with respect to the repatriation of foreign earnings and cash changes in foreign political regulatory and economic conditions including regionally nationally and locally challenges in managing international operations challenges of complying 

 

  

with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations including those relating to real estate corporate governance operations taxes employment and legal proceedings foreign ownership restrictions with respect to operations in countries differences in lending practices and the willingness of domestic or foreign lenders to provide financing regional or countryspecific business cycles and economic instability and failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations in the united states that affect foreign operations including but not limited to the us foreign corrupt practices act if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with international expansion and operations our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

  

we do not know if our tenants will renew their existing leases and if they do not we may be unable to lease the properties on as favorable terms or at all 

  

we cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases at the end of their lease terms which expire at various times if these leases are not renewed we would be required to find other tenants to occupy those properties or sell them there can be no assurance that we would be able to identify suitable replacement tenants or enter into leases with new tenants on terms as favorable to us as the current leases or that we would be able to lease those properties at all 

  

our operators’ may not have the necessary insurance coverage to insure adequately against losses 

  

in recent years skilled nursing and seniors housing operators have experienced substantial increases in both the number and size of patient care liability claims as a result general and professional liability costs have increased in some markets general and professional liability insurance coverage may be restricted or very costly which may adversely affect the property operators’ future operations cash flows and financial condition and may have a material adverse effect on the property operators’ ability to meet their obligations to us 

  

our ownership of properties through ground leases exposes us to the loss of such properties upon breach or termination of the ground leases 

  

we have acquired an interest in certain of our properties by acquiring a leasehold interest in the property on which the building is located and we may acquire additional properties in the future through the purchase of interests in ground leases as the lessee under a ground lease we are exposed to the possibility of losing the property upon termination of the ground lease or an earlier breach of the ground lease by us 

  

the requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid could have a material adverse effect on our obligors’ liquidity financial condition and results of operations which could adversely affect our obligors’ ability to meet their obligations to us 

  

some of our obligors’ businesses are affected by government reimbursement to the extent that an operatortenant receives a significant portion of its revenues from government payors primarily medicare and medicaid such revenues may be subject to statutory and regulatory changes retroactive rate adjustments recovery of program overpayments or setoffs court decisions administrative rulings policy interpretations payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers government funding restrictions at a program level or with respect to specific facilities and interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing government investigations and audits at such property in recent years government payors have frozen or reduced payments to health care providers due to budgetary pressures health care reimbursement will likely continue to be of paramount importance to federal and state authorities we cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or effect any future legislative reforms may have on the financial condition of our obligors and properties there can be no assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will be available for services provided by any property operator whether the property receives reimbursement from medicare medicaid or private payors significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on an obligor’s liquidity financial condition and results of operations which could adversely affect the ability of an obligor to meet its obligations to us see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — united states — reimbursement” above 

  

the patient protection and affordable care act of 2010 as modified by the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the “health reform laws” provides those states that expand their medicaid coverage to otherwise eligible state residents with incomes at or below 138 of the federal poverty level with an increased federal medical assistance percentage effective january 1 2014 when certain conditions are met on june 28 2012 the united states supreme court upheld the individual mandate of the health reform laws but partially invalidated the expansion of medicaid the ruling on medicaid expansion allows states to elect not to participate in the expansion—and to forego funding for the medicaid expansion—without losing their existing medicaid funding given that the federal government substantially funds the medicaid expansion it is unclear how many states will ultimately pursue this option although as of late january 2014 roughly half of the states have made statements or otherwise indicated that they do not intend to expand medicaid coverage at this time the participation by states in the medicaid expansion could have the 

 

  

dual effect of increasing our tenants’ revenues through new patients but further straining state budgets and their ability to pay our tenants while the federal government will pay for approximately 100 of those additional costs from 2014 to 2016 states will be expected to pay for part of those additional costs beginning in 2017 in light of this at least one state that has passed legislation to allow the state to expand its medicaid coverage has included sunset provisions in the legislation that require that the expanded benefits be reduced or eliminated if the federal government’s funding for the program is decreased or eliminated permitting the state to revisit the issue once it begins to share financial responsibility for the expansion with increasingly strained budgets it is unclear how states that do not include such sunset provisions will pay their share of these additional medicaid costs and what other health care expenditures could be reduced as a result a significant reduction in other health care related spending by states to pay for increased medicaid costs could affect our tenants’ revenue streams see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — united states — reimbursement” above and “item 7 — management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — health care industry — health reform laws” below 

  

more generally and because of the dynamic nature of the legislative and regulatory environment for health care products and services and in light of existing federal deficit and budgetary concerns we cannot predict the impact that broadbased farreaching legislative or regulatory changes could have on the us economy our business or that of our operators and tenants 

  

our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with federal state local and industryregulated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards could adversely affect such operators’ or tenants’ operations which could adversely affect our operators’ and tenants’ ability to meet their obligations to us 

  

our operators and tenants generally are subject to varying levels of federal state local and industryregulated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with any of these laws regulations or standards could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension decertification or exclusion from federal and state health care programs loss of license or closure of the facility such actions may have an effect on our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make lease payments to us and therefore adversely impact us see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — united states — other related laws” above 

  

many of our properties may require a license registration andor certificate of need “con” to operate failure to obtain a license registration or con or loss of a required license registration or con would prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by the operators or tenants these events could materially adversely affect our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make rent payments to us state and local laws also may regulate the expansion including the addition of new beds or services or acquisition of medical equipment and the construction or renovation of health care facilities by requiring a con or other similar approval from a state agency see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — united states — licensing and certification” above 

  

illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties 

  

real estate investments are relatively illiquid our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in economic and other conditions will be limited no assurances can be given that we will recognize full value for any property that we are required to sell for liquidity reasons our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition we are exposed to the risks inherent in concentrating investments in real estate and in particular the seniors housing and health care industries a downturn in the real estate industry could adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to sell properties for a price or on terms acceptable to us 

  

unfavorable resolution of pending and future litigation matters and disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

  

from time to time we may be directly involved in a number of legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims we may also be named as defendants in lawsuits allegedly arising out of our actions or the actions of our operatorstenants or managers in which such operatorstenants or managers have agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses an unfavorable resolution of pending or future litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition regardless of its outcome litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of management there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail in or achieve a favorable settlement of pending or future litigation in addition pending litigation or future litigation government proceedings or environmental matters could lead to increased costs or interruption of our normal business operations 

  

development redevelopment and construction risks could affect our profitability 

  

 

  

at any given time we may be in the process of constructing one or more new facilities that ultimately will require a con and license before they can be utilized by the operator for their intended use the operator also may need to obtain medicare and medicaid certification and enter into medicare and medicaid provider agreements andor third party payor contracts in the event that the operator is unable to obtain the necessary con licensure certification provider agreements or contracts after the completion of construction there is a risk that we will not be able to earn any revenues on the facility until either the initial operator obtains a license or certification to operate the new facility and the necessary provider agreements or contracts or we find and contract with a new operator that is able to obtain a license to operate the facility for its intended use and the necessary provider agreements or contracts 

  

in connection with our renovation redevelopment development and related construction activities we may be unable to obtain or suffer delays in obtaining necessary zoning landuse building occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations these factors could result in increased costs or our abandonment of these projects in addition we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms which may render us unable to proceed with our development activities and we may not be able to complete construction and leaseup of a property on schedule which could result in increased debt service expense or construction costs 

  

additionally the time frame required for development construction and leaseup of these properties means that we may have to wait years for significant cash returns because we are required to make cash distributions to our stockholders if the cash flow from operations or refinancing is not sufficient we may be forced to borrow additional money to fund such distributions newly developed and acquired properties may not produce the cash flow that we expect which could adversely affect our overall financial performance 

  

in deciding whether to acquire or develop a particular property we make assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property in particular we estimate the return on our investment based on expected occupancy rental rates and capital costs if our financial projections with respect to a new property are inaccurate as a result of increases in capital costs or other factors the property may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment our estimate of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove to be inaccurate which may result in our failure to meet our profitability goals additionally we may acquire new properties that are not fully leased and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with that property 

  

we may experience losses caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters which could result in an increase of our or our tenants’ cost of insurance a decrease in our anticipated revenues or a significant loss of the capital we have invested in a property 

  

we maintain or require our tenants to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties with terms conditions limits and deductibles that we believe are appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage and we continually review our insurance programs and requirements however a large number of our properties are located in areas particularly susceptible to revenue loss cost increase or damage caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters such as hurricanes earthquakes tornadoes and floods we believe given current industry practice and analysis prepared by outside consultants that our and our tenants’ insurance coverage is appropriate to cover reasonably anticipated losses that may be caused by hurricanes earthquakes tornadoes floods and other severe weather conditions and natural disasters nevertheless we are always subject to the risk that such insurance will not fully cover all losses and depending on the severity of the event and the impact on our properties such insurance may not cover a significant portion of the losses these losses may lead to an increase of our and our tenants’ cost of insurance a decrease in our anticipated revenues from an affected property and a loss of all or a portion of the capital we have invested in an affected property in addition we or our tenants may not purchase insurance under certain circumstances if the cost of insurance exceeds in our or our tenants’ judgment the value of the coverage relative to the risk of loss 

  

we may incur costs to remediate environmental contamination at our properties which could have an adverse effect on our or our obligors’ business or financial condition 

  

under various federal and state laws owners or operators of real estate may be required to respond to the presence or release of hazardous substances on the property and may be held liable for property damage personal injuries or penalties that result from environmental contamination or exposure to hazardous substances we may become liable to reimburse the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination generally such liability attaches to a person based on the person’s relationship to the property our tenants or borrowers are primarily responsible for the condition of the property moreover we review environmental site assessments of the properties that we own or encumber prior to taking an interest in them those assessments are designed to meet the “all appropriate inquiry” standard which we believe qualifies us for the innocent purchaser defense if environmental liabilities arise based upon such assessments we do not believe that any of our properties are subject to material environmental contamination however environmental liabilities may be present in our properties and we may incur costs to remediate contamination which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition or the business or financial condition of our obligors 

 

  

  

cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our business and result in the loss of confidential information 

  

our business is at risk from and may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential data and other electronic security breaches such cyber attacks can range from individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems to more sophisticated security threats while we employ a number of measures to prevent detect and mitigate these threats there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a cyber attack cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our business and compromise the confidential information of our employees operators and tenants 

  

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain antitakeover provisions 

  

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain antitakeover provisions restrictions on share ownership and transfer and super majority stockholder approval requirements for business combinations that could make it more difficult for or even prevent a third party from acquiring us without the approval of our incumbent board of directors provisions and agreements that inhibit or discourage takeover attempts could reduce the market value of our common stock 

  

our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed 

  

we are dependent on key personnel although we have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers losing any one of them could at least temporarily have an adverse impact on our operations we believe that losing more than one could have a material adverse impact on our business 

  

risks arising from our capital structure 

  

we may become more leveraged 

  

permanent financing for our investments is typically provided through a combination of public offerings of debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt the incurrence or assumption of indebtedness may cause us to become more leveraged which could 1 require us to dedicate a greater portion of our cash flow to the payment of debt service 2 make us more vulnerable to a downturn in the economy 3 limit our ability to obtain additional financing or 4 negatively affect our credit ratings or outlook by one or more of the rating agencies 

  

we are subject to covenants in our debt agreements that may restrict or limit our operations and acquisitions and our failure to comply with the covenants in our debt agreements could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

our debt agreements contain various covenants restrictions and events of default among other things these provisions require us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness create liens and make investments or acquisitions breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness in addition to any other indebtedness crossdefaulted against such instruments these defaults could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to make future investments or to meet our obligations and commitments 

  

we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the capital necessary to make future investments or to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature our access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control including rising interest rates inflation and other general market conditions the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions the market price of the shares of our capital stock and the credit ratings of our debt securities the financial stability of our lenders which might impair their ability to meet their commitments to us or their willingness to make additional loans to us changes in the credit ratings on us government debt securities or default or delay in payment by the united states of its obligations if our access to capital is limited by these factors or other factors it could negatively impact our ability to acquire properties repay or refinance our indebtedness fund operations or make distributions to our stockholders 

  

also the federal government’s failure to increase the amount of debt that it is statutorily permitted to incur as needed to meet its future financial commitments or a downgrade in the debt rating on us government securities could lead to a weakened us 

 

  

dollar rising interest rates and constrained access to capital which could materially adversely affect the us and global economies increase our costs of borrowing and have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity andor financial condition 

  

downgrades in our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital 

  

we plan to manage the company to maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile but there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity andor financial condition 

  

fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 

  

as we expand our operations internationally currency exchange rate fluctuations could affect our results of operations and financial position we expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenue and expenses in such foreign currencies as the canadian dollar and the british pound although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions andor obtain local currency mortgage debt in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies we cannot assure you that foreign currency fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on us 

  

our entry into swap agreements may not effectively reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates 

  

we enter into swap agreements from time to time to manage some of our exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate volatility these swap agreements involve risks such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements in addition these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates when we use forwardstarting interest rate swaps there is a risk that we will not complete the longterm borrowing against which the swap is intended to hedge if such events occur our results of operations may be adversely affected 

  

risks arising from our status as a reit 

  

we might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

  

we intend to operate as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” and believe we have and will continue to operate in such a manner if we lose our status as a reit we will face serious income tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for satisfying our obligations and for distribution to our stockholders because 

  

•   we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rates 

•   we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes and 

•   unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions we could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified 

  

since reit qualification requires us to meet a number of complex requirements it is possible that we may fail to fulfill them and if we do our earnings will be reduced by the amount of us federal and other income taxes owed a reduction in our earnings would affect the amount we could distribute to our stockholders if we do not qualify as a reit we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders since a nonreit is not required to pay dividends to stockholders in order to maintain reit status or avoid an excise tax see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations” above for a discussion of the provisions of the code that apply to us and the effects of failure to qualify as a reit 

  

in addition if we fail to qualify as a reit all distributions to stockholders would continue to be treated as dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits although corporate stockholders may be eligible for the dividends received deduction and individual stockholders may be eligible for taxation at the rates generally applicable to longterm capital gains currently at a maximum rate of 20 with respect to distributions 

  

as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to implement our business strategy and would adversely affect the value of our common stock 

  

 

  

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to remain qualified as a reit although we believe that we qualify as a reit we cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify or remain qualified as a reit for us federal income tax purposes see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations” above 

  

the 90 annual distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions 

  

to comply with the 90 distribution requirement applicable to reits and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax we must make distributions to our stockholders see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations — qualification as a reit — annual distribution requirements” above although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the reit distribution requirement it is possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90 distribution requirement or we may decide to retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation this may be due to timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses on the one hand and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income on the other hand in addition nondeductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of noncash deductions may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90 distribution requirement in the event that timing differences occur or we deem it appropriate to retain cash we may borrow funds issue additional equity securities although we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so pay taxable stock dividends if possible distribute other property or securities or engage in another transaction intended to enable us to meet the reit distribution requirements this may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations 

  

the lease of qualified health care properties to a taxable reit subsidiary is subject to special requirements 

  

we lease certain qualified health care properties to taxable reit subsidiaries or limited liability companies of which the taxable reit subsidiaries are members which lessees contract with managers or related parties to manage the health care operations at these properties the rents from this taxable reit subsidiary lessee structure are treated as qualifying rents from real property if 1 they are paid pursuant to an armslength lease of a qualified health care property with a taxable reit subsidiary and 2 the manager qualifies as an eligible independent contractor as defined in the code if any of these conditions are not satisfied then the rents will not be qualifying rents see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations — qualification as a reit — income tests” above 

  

if certain saleleaseback transactions are not characterized by the internal revenue service as “true leases” we may be subject to adverse tax consequences 

  

we have purchased certain properties and leased them back to the sellers of such properties and we may enter into similar transactions in the future we intend for any such saleleaseback transaction to be structured in such a manner that the lease will be characterized as a “true lease” thereby allowing us to be treated as the owner of the property for us federal income tax purposes however depending on the terms of any specific transaction the internal revenue service might take the position that the transaction is not a “true lease” but is more properly treated in some other manner in the event any saleleaseback transaction is challenged and successfully recharacterized by the internal revenue service we would not be entitled to claim the deductions for depreciation and cost recovery generally available to an owner of property furthermore if a saleleaseback transaction were so recharacterized we might fail to satisfy the reit asset tests or income tests and consequently could lose our reit status effective with the year of recharacterization see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations — qualification as a reit — asset tests” and “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations — qualification as a reit — income tests” above alternatively the amount of our reit taxable income could be recalculated which may cause us to fail to meet the reit annual distribution requirements for a taxable year see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations — qualification as a reit — annual distribution requirements” above

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

  from time to time there are various legal proceedings pending to which we are a party or to which some of our properties are subject arising in the normal course of business we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  

  in august 2012 we entered into a merger agreement with sunrise senior living inc “sunrise” following the announcement of the merger agreement complaints were filed in the us district court for the eastern district of virginia and the chancery court for the state of delaware challenging the merger the complaints challenged the merger on behalf of a putative class of sunrise public stockholders and named as defendants sunrise its directors and us the complaints generally alleged that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the merger and that the entity defendants aided and abetted that breach the complaint filed in the us district court for the eastern district of virginia additionally alleged that the preliminary proxy statement filed with the securities and exchange commission by sunrise failed to provide material information in violation of sections 14a and 20a of the exchange act and rule 14a9 promulgated thereunder the complaints sought among other things injunctive relief against the merger unspecified damages and an award of plaintiffs’ expenses including attorneys’ fees on january 9 2013 we completed our acquisition of the sunrise property portfolio please see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

  

  on october 24 2013 the parties entered into a stipulation of settlement and release that settled the lawsuits subject to the approval of the us district court for the eastern district of virginia and the chancery court for the state of delaware respectively on january 24 2014 the us district court for the eastern district of virginia approved the stipulation of settlement and release and dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice and on february 6 2014 the chancery court for the state of delaware approved the plaintiffs’ voluntarily dismissal of the lawsuit with prejudice

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  we are exposed to various market risks including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we seek to mitigate the underlying foreign currency exposures with gains and losses on derivative contracts hedging these exposures we seek to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates by matching the terms of new investments with new longterm fixed rate borrowings to the extent possible we may or may not elect to use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate exposure these decisions are principally based on our policy to match our variable rate investments with comparable borrowings but are also based on the general trend in interest rates at the applicable dates and our perception of the future volatility of interest rates this section is presented to provide a discussion of the risks associated with potential fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

  we historically borrow on our primary unsecured line of credit arrangement to acquire construct or make loans relating to health care and seniors housing properties then as market conditions dictate we will issue equity or longterm fixed rate debt to repay the borrowings under our unsecured line of credit arrangements we are subject to risks associated with debt financing including the risk that existing indebtedness may not be refinanced or that the terms of refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of current indebtedness the majority of our borrowings were completed under indentures or contractual agreements that limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur accordingly in the event that we are unable to raise additional equity or borrow money because of these limitations our ability to acquire additional properties may be limited 

  a change in interest rates will not affect the interest expense associated with our fixed rate debt interest rate changes however will affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt changes in the interest rate environment upon maturity of this fixed rate debt could have an effect on our future cash flows and earnings depending on whether the debt is replaced with other fixed rate debt variable rate debt or equity or repaid by the sale of assets to illustrate the impact of changes in the interest rate markets we performed a sensitivity analysis on our fixed rate debt instruments whereby we modeled the change in net present values arising from a hypothetical 1 increase in interest rates to determine the instruments’ change in fair value the following table summarizes the analysis performed as of the dates indicated in thousands 



  our variable rate debt including our unsecured line of credit arrangements is reflected at fair value at december 31 2013 we had 1089362000 outstanding related to our variable rate debt assuming no changes in outstanding balances a 1 increase in interest rates would result in increased annual interest expense of 10893620 at december 31 2012 we had 527060000 outstanding related to our variable rate debt assuming no changes in outstanding balances a 1 increase in interest rates would have resulted in increased annual interest expense of 5271000 

  we are subject to currency fluctuations that may from time to time affect our financial condition and results of operations increases or decreases in the value of the canadian dollar or pounds sterling relative to the us dollar impacts the amount of net income we earn from our investments in canada and the united kingdom based solely on our results for the twelve months ended december 31 2013 if these exchange rates were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points our net income from these investments would decrease or increase as applicable by less than 500000 for the twelvemonth period we seek to mitigate these underlying foreign currency exposures with nonus denominated borrowings and gains and losses on derivative contracts hedging these exposures if we increase our international presence through investments in or acquisitions or development of seniors housing and health care properties outside the united states we may also decide to transact additional business or borrow funds in currencies other than the us dollar canadian dollars or pounds sterling to illustrate the impact of changes in foreign currency markets we performed a sensitivity analysis on our derivative portfolio whereby we modeled the change in net present values arising from a hypothetical 1 increase in foreign currency exchange rates to determine the instruments’ change in fair value the following table summarizes the results of the analysis performed dollars in thousands

investments 

  

depending upon market conditions we believe that new investments will be available in the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to our stockholders we invest in seniors housing and health care real estate primarily through acquisitions developments and joint venture partnerships for additional information regarding acquisition and development activity please see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements we diversify our investment portfolio by property type customer and geographic location in determining whether to invest in a property we focus on the following 1 the experience of the obligor’spartner’s management team 2 the historical and projected financial and operational performance of the property 3 the credit of the obligorpartner 4 the security for any lease or loan 5 the real estate attributes of the building and its location 6 the capital committed to the property by the obligorpartner and 7 the operating fundamentals of the applicable industry we conduct market research and analysis for all potential investments in addition we review the value of all properties the interest rates and covenant requirements of any facilitylevel debt to be assumed at the time of the acquisition and the anticipated sources of repayment of any existing debt that is not to be assumed at the time of the acquisition 

  

we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property our proactive and comprehensive asset management process for seniors housing properties generally includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each property review of obligorpartner creditworthiness property inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure real estate taxes letters of credit and other collateral our internal property management division actively manages and monitors the medical office building portfolio with a comprehensive process including tenant relations lease expirations the mix of health service providers hospitalhealth system relationships property performance capital improvement needs and market conditions among other things in monitoring our portfolio our personnel use a proprietary database to collect and analyze propertyspecific data additionally we conduct extensive research to ascertain industry trends 

  

we evaluate the operating environment in each property’s market to determine the likely trend in operating performance of the facility when we identify unacceptable trends we seek to mitigate eliminate or transfer the risk through these efforts we are generally able to intervene at an early stage to address any negative trends and in so doing support both the collectability of revenue and the value of our investment 

  

investment types 

  

real property our properties are primarily comprised of land building improvements and related rights our hospitals and seniors housing triplenet properties are generally leased to operators under longterm operating leases the leases generally have a fixed contractual term of 12 to 15 years and contain one or more five to 15year renewal options certain of our leases also contain purchase options most of our rents are received under triplenet leases requiring the operator to pay rent and all additional charges incurred in the operation of the leased property the tenants are required to repair rebuild and maintain the leased properties substantially all of these operating leases are designed with escalating rent structures leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straightline basis over the initial lease period subject to a collectability assessment rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period 

  

at december 31 2012 approximately 91 of our hospitals and seniors housing triplenet properties were subject to master leases a master lease is a lease of multiple properties to one tenant entity under a single lease agreement from time to time we may acquire additional properties that are then leased to the tenant under the master lease the tenant is required to make one monthly payment that represents rent on all the properties that are subject to the master lease typically the master lease tenant can exercise its right to purchase the properties or to renew the master lease only with respect to all leased properties at the same time this bundling feature benefits us because the tenant cannot limit the purchase or renewal to the better performing properties and terminate the leasing arrangement with respect to the poorer performing properties this spreads our risk among the entire group of properties within the master lease the bundling feature should provide a similar advantage if the master lease tenant is in bankruptcy subject to certain restrictions a debtor in bankruptcy has the right to assume or reject each of its leases it is our intent that a tenant in bankruptcy would be required to assume or reject the master lease as a whole rather than deciding on a property by property basis 

  

  

 

  

  

our medical office building portfolio is primarily selfmanaged and consists principally of multitenant properties leased to health care providers our leases have favorable lease terms that typically include increasers and some form of operating expense reimbursement by the tenant as of december 31 2012 83 of our portfolio included leases with full pass through 15 with a partial expense reimbursement modified gross and 2 with no expense reimbursement gross our medical office building leases are noncancellable operating leases that have a weightedaverage remaining term of 80 years at december 31 2012 and are often credit enhanced by guaranties andor letters of credit 

  

construction we occasionally provide for the construction of properties for tenants as part of longterm operating leases we capitalize certain interest costs associated with funds used for the construction of properties owned by us the amount capitalized is based upon the amount advanced during the construction period using the rate of interest that approximates our companywide cost of financing our interest expense is reduced by the amount capitalized we also typically charge a transaction fee at the commencement of construction which we defer and amortize to income over the term of the resulting lease the construction period commences upon funding and terminates upon the earlier of the completion of the applicable property or the end of a specified period during the construction period we advance funds to the tenants in accordance with agreed upon terms and conditions which require among other things periodic site visits by a company representative during the construction period we generally require an additional credit enhancement in the form of payment and performance bonds andor completion guaranties at december 31 2012 we had outstanding construction investments of 162984000 and were committed to provide additional funds of approximately 213255000 to complete construction for investment properties 

  

real estate loans our real estate loans are typically structured to provide us with interest income principal amortization and transaction fees and are generally secured by firstsecond mortgage liens leasehold mortgages corporate guaranties andor personal guaranties at december 31 2012 we had outstanding real estate loans of 895665000 the interest yield averaged approximately 64 per annum on our outstanding real estate loan balances our yield on real estate loans depends upon a number of factors including the stated interest rate average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments the real estate loans outstanding at december 31 2012 are generally subject to one to 15year terms with principal amortization schedules andor balloon payments of the outstanding principal balances at the end of the term typically real estate loans are crossdefaulted and crosscollateralized with other real estate loans operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its affiliates 

  

  investments in unconsolidated entities  our investments in unconsolidated entities generally represent interests ranging from 10 to 50 in real estate assets investments in less than majority owned entities where our interests represent a general partnership interest but substantive participating or kickout rights have been granted to the limited partners or where our interests do not represent the general partnership interest and we do not control the major operating and financial policies of the entity are reported under the equity method of accounting under the equity method of accounting our share of the investee’s earnings or losses is included in our consolidated results of operations to the extent that our cost basis is different from the basis reflected at the entity level the basis difference is generally amortized over the lives of the related assets and liabilities and such amortization is included in our share of equity in earnings of the entity the initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated entities is based on the amount paid to purchase the entity interest or the estimated fair value of the assets prior to the sale of interests in the entity other equity investments include an investment in availableforsale securities these equity investments represented a minimal ownership interest in these companies we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the equity method investment to its carrying value when we determine a decline in the estimated fair value of such an investment below its carrying value is otherthantemporary an impairment is recorded see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for more information 

  

principles of consolidation 

  

the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our whollyowned subsidiaries and joint venture entities that we control through voting rights or other means all material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation 

  

at inception of the joint venture transactions we identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights “variable interest entities” or “vies” and determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of its operations a vie is broadly defined as an entity where either i the equity investors as a group if any do not have a controlling financial interest or ii the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support we consolidate investments in vies when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary accounting standards codification topic 810 consolidations  requires enterprises to perform a qualitative approach to determining whether or not a vie will need to be consolidated on a continuous basis this evaluation is based on an enterprise’s ability to direct and influence the activities of a vie that most significantly impact that entity’s economic performance 

  

for investments in joint ventures we evaluate the type of rights held by the limited partners which may preclude consolidation in circumstances in which the sole general partner would otherwise consolidate the limited partnership the assessment of limited 

  

 

  

  

partners’ rights and their impact on the presumption of control over a limited partnership by the sole general partner should be made when an investor becomes the sole general partner and should be reassessed if i there is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights of the limited partners ii the sole general partner increases or decreases its ownership in the limited partnership interests or iii there is an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding limited partnership interests we similarly evaluate the rights of managing members of limited liability companies 

  

borrowing policies 

  

we utilize a combination of debt and equity to fund investments our debt and equity levels are determined by management to maintain a conservative credit profile generally we intend to issue unsecured fixedrate public debt with longterm maturities to approximate the maturities on our leases and loans for shortterm purposes we may borrow on our primary unsecured line of credit arrangement we replace these borrowings with longterm capital such as senior unsecured notes common stock or preferred stock when terms are deemed favorable we may invest in properties subject to existing mortgage indebtedness in addition we may obtain secured financing for unleveraged properties in which we have invested or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis in our agreements with our lenders we are subject to restrictions with respect to secured and unsecured indebtedness 

  

competition 

  

we compete with other real estate investment trusts real estate partnerships private equity and hedge fund investors banks insurance companies financeinvestment companies governmentsponsored agencies taxable and taxexempt bond funds health care operators developers and other investors in the acquisition development leasing and financing of health care and seniors housing properties we compete for investments based on a number of factors including investment structures underwriting criteria and reputation our ability to successfully compete is impacted by economic and demographic trends availability of acceptable investment opportunities our ability to negotiate beneficial investment terms availability and cost of capital construction and renovation costs and new and existing laws and regulations 

  

the operatorstenants of our properties compete on a local and regional basis with operatorstenants of properties that provide comparable services operatorstenants compete for patients and residents based on a number of factors including quality of care reputation physical appearance of properties location services offered family preferences physicians staff and price we also face competition from other health care facilities for tenants such as physicians and other health care providers that provide comparable facilities and services

certain government regulations 

  

health law matters — generally 

  

  typically operators of seniors housing facilities do not receive significant funding from government programs and are largely subject to state laws as opposed to federal laws operators of skilled nursing facilities and hospitals do receive significant funding from government programs and these facilities are subject to the federal and state laws that regulate the type and quality of the medical andor nursing care provided ancillary services  eg respiratory occupational physical and infusion therapies qualifications of the administrative personnel and nursing staff the adequacy of the physical plant and equipment reimbursement and rate setting and operating policies in addition as described below operators of these facilities are subject to extensive laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including but not limited to the federal antikickback statute the federal stark law and the federal false claims act as well as comparable state law counterparts hospitals physician group practice clinics and other health care providers that operate in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal state and local licensure registration certification and inspection laws regulations and industry standards our tenants’ failure to comply with any of these and other laws could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension decertification or exclusion from federal and state health care programs loss of license or closure of the facility 

  

licensing and certification 

  

 

  

  

  

the primary regulations that affect seniors housing facilities with assisted living are state licensing and registration laws in granting and renewing these licenses the state regulatory agencies consider numerous factors relating to a property’s physical plant and operations including but not limited to admission and discharge standards staffing and training a decision to grant or renew a license is also affected by a property owner’s record with respect to patient and consumer rights medication guidelines and rules certain of the seniors housing facilities mortgaged to or owned by us may require the resident to pay an entrance or upfront fee a portion of which may be refundable these entrance fee communities are subject to significant state regulatory oversight including for example oversight of each facility’s financial condition establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial restrictions the right of residents to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time lien rights in favor of residents restrictions on change of ownership and similar matters such oversight and the rights of residents within these entrance fee communities may have an effect on the revenue or operations of the operators of such facilities and therefore may adversely affect us 

  

  certain health care facilities are subject to a variety of licensure and certificate of need “con” laws and regulations where applicable con laws generally require among other requirements that a facility demonstrate the need for 1 constructing a new facility 2 adding beds or expanding an existing facility 3 investing in major capital equipment or adding new services 4 changing the ownership or control of an existing licensed facility or 5 terminating services that have been previously approved through the con process certain state con laws and regulations may restrict the ability of operators to add new properties or expand an existing facility’s size or services in addition con laws may constrain the ability of an operator to transfer responsibility for operating a particular facility to a new operator if we have to replace a property operator who is excluded from participating in a federal or state health care program as discussed below our ability to replace the operator may be affected by a particular state’s con laws regulations and applicable guidance governing changes in provider control 

  

  with respect to licensure generally our skilled nursing facilities and acute care facilities are required to be licensed and certified for participation in medicare medicaid and other federal health care programs this generally requires license renewals and compliance surveys on an annual or biannual basis the failure of our operators to maintain or renew any required license or regulatory approval as well as the failure of our operators to correct serious deficiencies identified in a compliance survey could require those operators to discontinue operations at a property in addition if a property is found to be out of compliance with medicare medicaid or other health care program conditions of participation the property operator may be excluded from participating in those government health care programs any such occurrence may impair an operator’s ability to meet their financial obligations to us if we have to replace an excludedproperty operator our ability to replace the operator may be affected by federal and state laws regulations and applicable guidance governing changes in provider control this may result in payment delays an inability to find a replacement operator a significant working capital commitment from us to a new operator or other difficulties 

  

  reimbursement 

  

  seniors housing facilities excluding skilled nursing facilities approximately 58 of our overall revenues for the year ended december 31 2012 were attributable to seniors housing facilities the majority of the revenues received by the operators of these facilities are from private pay sources the remaining revenue source is primarily medicaid under certain waiver programs as a part of the omnibus budget reconciliation act “obra” of 1981 congress established a waiver program enabling some states to offer medicaid reimbursement to assisted living providers as an alternative to institutional longterm care services the provisions of obra and the subsequent obra acts of 1987 and 1990 permit states to seek a waiver from typical medicaid requirements to develop costeffective alternatives to longterm care including medicaid payments for assisted living and home health as of december 31 2012 ten of our 42 seniors housing operators received medicaid reimbursement pursuant to medicaid waiver programs for the twelve months ended september 30 2012 approximately 4 of the revenues at our seniors housing facilities were from medicaid reimbursement there can be no guarantee that a state medicaid program operating pursuant to a waiver will be able to maintain its waiver status 

  

  rates paid by selfpay residents are set by the facilities and are determined by local market conditions and operating costs generally facilities receive a higher payment per day for a private pay resident than for a medicaid beneficiary who requires a comparable level of care the level of medicaid reimbursement varies from state to state thus the revenues generated by operators of our assisted living facilities may be adversely affected by payor mix acuity level changes in medicaid eligibility and reimbursement levels in addition a state could lose its medicaid waiver and no longer be permitted to utilize medicaid dollars to reimburse for assisted living services changes in revenues could in turn have a material adverse effect on an operator’s ability to meet its obligations to us 

  

  skilled nursing facilities and hospitals skilled nursing facilities and hospitals typically receive most of their revenues from the medicare and medicaid programs with the balance representing reimbursement payments from private payors including private 

  

 

  

  

insurers consequently changes in federal or state reimbursement policies may also adversely affect an operator’s ability to cover its expenses including our rent or debt service skilled nursing facilities and hospitals are subject to periodic pre and postpayment reviews and other audits by federal and state authorities a review or audit of a property operator’s claims could result in recoupments denials or delay of payments in the future which could have a material adverse effect on the operator’s ability to meet its financial obligations to us due to the significant judgments and estimates inherent in payor settlement accounting no assurance can be given as to the adequacy of any reserves maintained by our property operators to cover potential adjustments to reimbursements or to cover settlements made to payors in fact in december 2010 the department of health and human services office of inspector general “oig” released a report focusing on skilled nursing facilities’ billing practices for medicare part a payments and found that between 20062008 skilled nursing facilities increasingly billed for higher paying resource utilization groups “rugs” the payment classification mechanism for the medicare program even though beneficiary characteristics remained largely unchanged in particular from 2006 to 2008 oig found that the percentage of rugs for ultra high therapy increased from 17 to 28 despite the fact that beneficiaries’ ages and diagnoses at admission were largely unchanged during that time period in november 2012 the oig released a report focused on inappropriate payments to skilled nursing facilities and found that of the 499 claims from 2009 that were reviewed in the study skilled nursing facilities billed 25 of the claims in error and misreported information on the minimum data set “mds” for 47 of the claims recent attention on skilled nursing billing practices and payments or ongoing government pressure to reduce spending by government health care programs could result in lower payments to skilled nursing facilities and as a result may impair an operator’s ability to meet its financial obligations to us 

  

  medicare reimbursement and skilled nursing facilities for the twelve months ended september 30 2012 approximately 29 of the revenues at our skilled nursing facilities which comprised 20 of our overall revenues for the year ended december 31 2012 were paid by medicare skilled nursing facilities are reimbursed under the medicare skilled nursing facility prospective payment system “snf pps” there is a risk that some skilled nursing facilities’ costs will exceed the fixed payments under the snf pps and there is also a risk that payments under the snf pps may be set below the costs to provide certain items and services which could result in immediate financial difficulties for skilled nursing facilities and could cause operators to seek bankruptcy protection skilled nursing facilities have faced these types of difficulties since the implementation of the snf pps 

  

  the centers for medicare  medicaid services “cms” an agency of the us department of health and human services “hhs” made a positive payment update for skilled nursing facilities for fiscal year 2013 for fiscal year 2013 skilled nursing facilities received a 18 increase in rug payments resulting from a 25 market basket update less a 07 multifactor productivity adjustment  in addition on november 21 2011 the joint select committee on deficit reduction which was created by the budget control act of 2011 concluded its work and issued a statement that it was not able to make a bipartisan agreement thus triggering the sequestration process on january 2 2013 president obama signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 which delayed the sequestration process until march 2013 the sequestration process if triggered will result in spending reductions including medicare cuts the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 also increased the multiple procedure discount for part b therapy services from 25 to 50 effective april 2013 

  

  in addition section 5008 of the deficit reduction act of 2005 directed the secretary of hhs to conduct a post acute care payment reform demonstration “pacprd” program for a three year period beginning january 1 2008 to assess the costs and outcomes of patients discharged from hospitals in a variety of postacute care settings including skilled nursing facilities the demonstration program’s results and recommendations were reported to congress in a january 2012 report the results and recommendations could lead to future changes in medicare coverage reimbursement and reporting requirements for postacute care 

  

  the balanced budget act of 1997 mandated caps on medicare reimbursement for certain therapy services however congress imposed various waivers on the implementation of those caps the middle class tax relief and job creation act of 2012 made a number of changes including effective on october 1 2012 applying the therapy caps to outpatient hospitals creating two new threshold amounts of 3700 one for each therapy cap amount and requiring a manual medical review process of claims over these new thresholds the middle class tax relief and job creation act of 2012 also extended the waiver program related to therapy caps through the end of 2012 these therapy caps may negatively impact payments to skilled nursing facilities however members of medpac recently stated that they would prefer not to have hard caps which indicates that the waiver program for therapy caps will likely continue 

  

  if the waiver program expires patients will need to use private funds to pay for the cost of therapy above the caps if patients are unable to satisfy their outofpocket cost responsibility to reimburse an operator for services rendered the operator’s ability to meet its financial obligations to us could be adversely impacted 

  

  medicare reimbursement and hospitals for the twelve months ended september 30 2012 approximately 52 of the revenues at our hospitals which comprised 5 of our overall revenues for the year ended december 31 2012 were from medicare reimbursements hospitals generally are reimbursed by medicare under the hospital inpatient prospective payment system “pps” 

  

 

  

  

the hospital outpatient prospective payment system “opps” the long term care hospital prospective payment system “ltch pps” or the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system “irf pps” acute care hospitals provide a wide range of inpatient and outpatient services including but not limited to surgery rehabilitation therapy and clinical laboratory services longterm acute care hospitals provide inpatient services for patients with medical conditions that are often complex and that require more intensive care monitoring or emergency support than that available in most skilled nursing facilities inpatient rehabilitation facilities provide intensive rehabilitation services in an inpatient setting for patients requiring at least three hours of rehabilitation services a day 

  

with respect to medicare’s pps for regular hospitals reimbursement for inpatient services is made on the basis of a fixed prospective rate based on the principal diagnosis of the patient hospitals may be at risk to the extent that their costs in treating a specific case exceed the fixed payment amount the diagnosis related group “drg” reimbursement system was updated in 2008 to expand the number of drgs from 538 to 745 in order to better distinguish more severe conditions the addition of new drgs raised the total number of drgs to 751 in some cases a hospital might be able to qualify for an outlier payment if the hospital’s losses exceed a threshold 

  

on august 1 2012 cms published a final rule for the inpatient prospective payment system which sets forth acute care and longterm care hospital payment rate changes for the 2013 fiscal year specifically cms estimates that for fiscal year 2013 the medicare rates for inpatient stays at acute care hospitals will increase by 28 for those hospitals that successfully participate in the hospital inpatient quality reporting program while those that do not successfully participate in that program would receive a payment rate increase of 08 cms also implemented a 375 onetime budget neutrality adjustment to the longterm care hospital rate that would be phased in over three years the first year phase in of that adjustment will be 13 which would apply to payments or discharges on or after december 29 2012 cms adopted a oneyear extension of the existing moratorium on the 25 threshold policy through fiscal year 2013 beginning on or after october 1 2012 and before october 1 2013 cms clarified its regulations to reflect an existing policy that the inpatient prospective payment system comparable per diem amount is capped at an amount comparable to what would have been a full payment under the inpatient prospective payment system and that cap applies to short stay cases in longterm care hospitals with discharges occurring on or after december 29 2012 the legislative moratorium on new longterm hospitals and satellite facilities is set to expire at the end of 2012 additionally on july 30 2012 cms released notices updating the payment rates for inpatient rehabilitation facilities “irfs” for irf discharges occurring on or after october 1 2012 and on or before september 30 2013 cms is implementing a net 19 rate increase 

  

  on november 1 2012 cms published the calendar year 2013 final rule with comment period for outpatient care hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers cms estimates that the rates and policies in the final rule will increase payment rates for ambulatory surgery centers by 06 

  

medicare reimbursement and physicians cms annually adjusts the medicare physician fee schedule payment rates based on an update formula that includes application of the sustainable growth rate “sgr” on november 1 2011 cms published the calendar year 2012 physician fee schedule final rule for a negative 274 update under the statutory sgr formula in february 2012 congress passed the middle class tax relief and job creation act of 2012 which blocked the cut through the end of 2012 on november 1 2012 cms published the calendar year 2013 physician fee schedule final rule with comment period the final rule calls for a negative 265 update under the statutory sgr formula congress has overridden the required reduction every year from 2003 through the end of 2012 the final rule continues implementation of quality and cost measures that will be used in establishing a new value−based modifier that would adjust physician payments based on whether they are providing higher quality and more efficient care the health reform laws as defined below require cms to begin making payment adjustments to certain physicians and physician groups on january 1 2015 and to apply the modifier to all physicians by january 1 2017 calendar year 2013 is the initial performance year for purposes of adjusting payments in calendar year 2015 

  

medicaid reimbursement medicaid is a major payor source for residents in our skilled nursing facilities and hospitals for the twelve months ended september 30 2012 approximately 49 of the revenues of our skilled nursing facilities and 11 of the revenues of our hospitals were attributable to medicaid reimbursement payments the federal and state governments share responsibility for financing medicaid the federal matching rate known as the federal medical assistance percentage “fmap” varies by state based on relative per capita income but is at least 50 in all states on average medicaid is the largest component of total state spending representing approximately 237 of total state expenditures in state fiscal year 2011 the percentage of medicaid dollars used for longterm care varies from state to state due in part to different ratios of elderly population and eligibility requirements within certain federal guidelines states have a fairly wide range of discretion to determine eligibility and reimbursement methodology many states reimburse longterm care facilities using fixed daily rates which are applied prospectively based on patient acuity and the historical costs incurred in providing patient care reasonable costs typically include allowances for staffing administrative and general expenses property and equipment  eg  real estate taxes depreciation and fair rental 

  

  

 

  

  

in most states medicaid does not fully reimburse the cost of providing skilled nursing services certain states are attempting to slow the rate of growth in medicaid expenditures by freezing rates or restricting eligibility and benefits our skilled nursing portfolio’s average medicaid rate will likely vary throughout the year as states continue to make interim changes to their budgets and medicaid funding in addition medicaid reimbursement rates may decline if revenues in a particular state are not sufficient to fund budgeted expenditures president obama’s proposed fiscal year budget for 2013 released on february 13 2012 includes a proposal to place new limits on state provider taxes that are used to pay the state share of medicaid and has the potential to further impact medicaid reimbursement rates the president’s budget includes a proposal to phase down the medicaid provider tax a tax paid by health care providers to help fund state medicaid programs beginning with a reduction from the current law level of 60 to 45 in fiscal year 2015 the president’s budget also includes a proposal to replace the federal matching rate for state medicaid and the children’s health insurance program with a single matching rate specific to each state 

  

the medicare part d drug benefit became effective january 1 2006 since that date lowincome medicare beneficiaries eligible for both medicare and full medicaid benefits including those nursing home residents who are dually eligible for both programs may enroll and receive outpatient prescription drugs under medicare not medicaid medicare part d has resulted in increased administrative responsibilities for nursing home operators because enrollment in medicare part d is voluntary and residents must choose between multiple prescription drug plans operators may also experience increased expenses to the extent that a particular drug prescribed to a patient is not listed on the medicare part d drug plan formulary for the plan in which the patient is enrolled 

  

the reimbursement methodologies applied to health care facilities continue to evolve federal and state authorities have considered and may seek to implement new or modified reimbursement methodologies that may negatively impact health care property operations the impact of any such changes if implemented may result in a material adverse effect on our skilled nursing and hospital property operations no assurance can be given that current revenue sources or levels will be maintained accordingly there can be no assurance that payments under a government health care program are currently or will be in the future sufficient to fully reimburse the property operators for their operating and capital expenses as a result an operator’s ability to meet its financial obligations to us could be adversely impacted 

  

finally the patient protection and affordable care act of 2010 “ppaca” and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 which amends the ppaca collectively the “health reform laws” further discussed below may have a significant impact on medicare medicaid other federal health care programs and private insurers which impact the reimbursement amounts received by skilled nursing facilities and other health care providers the health reform laws could have a substantial and material adverse effect on all parties directly or indirectly involved in the health care system 

  

other related laws 

  

skilled nursing facilities and hospitals and seniors housing facilities that receive medicaid payments are subject to federal state and local laws regulations and applicable guidance that govern the operations and financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by health care providers certain of these laws prohibit direct or indirect payments of any kind for the purpose of inducing or encouraging the referral of patients for medical products or services reimbursable by government health care programs other laws require providers to furnish only medically necessary services and submit to the government valid and accurate statements for each service still other laws require providers to comply with a variety of safety health and other requirements relating to the condition of the licensed property and the quality of care provided sanctions for violations of these laws regulations and other applicable guidance may include but are not limited to criminal andor civil penalties and fines loss of licensure immediate termination of government payments and exclusion from any government health care program in certain circumstances violation of these rules such as those prohibiting abusive and fraudulent behavior with respect to one property may subject other facilities under common control or ownership to sanctions including exclusion from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs as well as other government health care programs in the ordinary course of its business a property operator is regularly subjected to inquiries investigations and audits by the federal and state agencies that oversee these laws and regulations 

  

all health care providers including but not limited to skilled nursing facilities and hospitals and seniors housing facilities that receive medicaid payments are also subject to the federal antikickback statute which generally prohibits persons from offering providing soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing of a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal health care program such as medicare or medicaid skilled nursing facilities and hospitals are also subject to the federal ethics in patient referral act of 1989 commonly referred to as the stark law the stark law generally prohibits the submission of claims to medicare for payment if the claim results from a physician referral for certain designated services and the physician has a financial relationship with the health service provider that does not qualify under one of the exceptions for a financial relationship under the stark law similar prohibitions on physician selfreferrals and submission of claims apply to state medicaid programs further health care providers including but not limited to skilled nursing facilities and hospitals and seniors housing facilities that receive medicaid payments are subject to substantial financial penalties under the civil 

  

 

  

  

monetary penalties act and the federal false claims act and in particular actions under the federal false claims act’s “whistleblower” provisions private enforcement of health care fraud has increased due in large part to amendments to the federal false claims act that encourage private individuals to sue on behalf of the government these whistleblower suits brought by private individuals known as qui tam actions may be filed by almost anyone including present and former patients nurses and other employees such whistleblower actions have been brought against nursing facilities on the basis of the alleged failure of the nursing facility to meet applicable regulations relating to its operations significantly if a claim is successfully adjudicated the federal false claims act provides for treble damages up to 11000 per claim 

  

prosecutions investigations or whistleblower actions could have a material adverse effect on a property operator’s liquidity financial condition and operations which could adversely affect the ability of the operator to meet its financial obligations to us finally various state false claim act and antikickback laws may also apply to each property operator violation of any of the foregoing statutes can result in criminal andor civil penalties that could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its financial obligations to us 

  

other legislative developments including the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” have greatly expanded the definition of health care fraud and related offenses and broadened its scope to include private health care plans in addition to government payors congress also has greatly increased funding for the department of justice federal bureau of investigation and the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services to audit investigate and prosecute suspected health care fraud moreover a significant portion of the billions in health care fraud recoveries over the past several years has also been returned to government agencies to further fund their fraud investigation and prosecution efforts 

  

additionally other hipaa provisions and regulations provide for communication of health information through standard electronic transaction formats and for the privacy and security of health information in order to comply with the regulations health care providers often must undertake significant operational and technical implementation efforts operators also may face significant financial exposure if they fail to maintain the privacy and security of medical records and other personal health information about individuals the health information technology for economic and clinical health “hitech” act passed in february 2009 strengthened the hhs secretary’s authority to impose civil money penalties for hipaa violations occurring after february 18 2009 hitech directs the hhs secretary to provide for periodic audits to ensure covered entities and their business associates as that term is defined under hipaa comply with the applicable hitech requirements increasing the likelihood that a hipaa violation will result in an enforcement action cms issued an interim final rule which conformed hipaa enforcement regulations to the hitech act increasing the maximum penalty for multiple violations of a single requirement or prohibition to 15 million higher penalties may accrue for violations of multiple requirements or prohibitions additionally on january 17 2013 cms released a final rule which expands the applicability of hipaa and hitech and strengthens the government’s ability to enforce these laws the final rule broadens the definition of “business associate” and provides for civil money penalty liability against covered entities and business associates for the acts of their agents regardless of whether a business associate agreement is in place additionally the final rule adopts certain changes to the hipaa enforcement regulations to incorporate the increased and tiered civil monetary penalty structure provided by hitech and makes business associates of covered entities directly liable under hipaa for compliance with certain of the hipaa privacy standards and hipaa security standards hipaa violations are also potentially subject to criminal penalties 

  

in november 2002 cms began an ongoing national nursing home quality initiative “nhqi” under this initiative historical survey information the nhqi pilot evaluation report and the nhqi overview is made available to the public online the nhqi website provides consumer and provider information regarding the quality of care in nursing homes the data allows consumers providers states and researchers to compare quality information that shows how well nursing homes are caring for their residents’ physical and clinical needs the posted nursing home quality measures come from resident assessment data that nursing homes routinely collect on the residents at specified intervals during their stay if the operators of nursing facilities are unable to achieve quality of care ratings that are comparable or superior to those of their competitors they may lose market share to other facilities reducing their revenues and adversely impacting their ability to make rental payments 

  

finally government investigations and enforcement actions brought against the health care industry have increased dramatically over the past several years and are expected to continue some of these enforcement actions represent novel legal theories and expansions in the application of the federal false claims act the costs for an operator of a health care property associated with both defending such enforcement actions and the undertakings in settling these actions can be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its obligations to us

general 

  

we elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust a “reit” commencing with our first taxable year we intend to continue to operate in such a manner as to qualify as a reit but there is no guarantee that we will qualify or remain qualified as a reit for subsequent years qualification and taxation as a reit depends upon our ability to meet a variety of qualification tests imposed under federal income tax law with respect to income assets distribution level and diversity of share ownership as discussed below under “— qualification as a reit” there can be no assurance that we will be owned and organized and will operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified 

  

in any year in which we qualify as a reit in general we will not be subject to federal income tax on that portion of our reit taxable income or capital gain that is distributed to stockholders we may however be subject to tax at normal corporate rates on any taxable income or capital gain not distributed if we elect to retain and pay income tax on our net longterm capital gain stockholders are required to include their proportionate share of our undistributed longterm capital gain in income but they will receive a refundable credit for their share of any taxes paid by us on such gain 

  

despite the reit election we may be subject to federal income and excise tax as follows 

  

• to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our “reit taxable income” as adjusted we will be subject to tax on the undistributed amount at regular corporate tax rates 

  

• we may be subject to the “alternative minimum tax” the “amt” on certain tax preference items to the extent that the amt exceeds our regular tax 

  

• if we have net income from the sale or other disposition of “foreclosure property” that is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business or other nonqualifying income from foreclosure property such income will be taxed at the highest corporate rate 

  

• any net income from prohibited transactions which are in general sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business other than dispositions of foreclosure property and dispositions of property due to an involuntary conversion will be subject to a 100 tax 

  

• if we fail to satisfy either the 75 or 95 gross income tests as discussed below but nonetheless maintain our qualification as a reit because certain other requirements are met we will be subject to a 100 tax on an amount equal to 1 the gross income attributable to the greater of i 75 of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75 gross income test discussed below or ii 95 of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 95 gross income test discussed below multiplied by 2 a fraction intended to reflect our profitability 

  

• if we fail to distribute during each year at least the sum of 1 85 of our reit ordinary income for the year 2 95 of our reit capital gain net income for such year other than capital gain that we elect to retain and pay tax on and 3 any undistributed taxable income from preceding periods we will be subject to a 4 excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over amounts actually distributed and 

  

  

 

  

  

• we will be subject to a 100 tax on the amount of any rents from real property deductions or excess interest paid to us by any of our “taxable reit subsidiaries” that would be reduced through reallocation under certain federal income tax principles in order to more clearly reflect income of the taxable reit subsidiary see “— qualification as a reit — investments in taxable reit subsidiaries” 

  

• we may be subject to the corporate “alternative minimum tax” on any items of tax preference including any deductions of net operating losses 

  

if we acquire any assets from a corporation which is or has been a “c” corporation in a carryover basis transaction we could be liable for specified liabilities that are inherited from the “c” corporation a “c” corporation is generally defined as a corporation that is required to pay full corporate level federal income tax if we recognize gain on the disposition of the assets during the tenyear period beginning on the date on which the assets were acquired by us then to the extent of the assets’ “builtin gain” ie the excess of the fair market value of the asset over the adjusted tax basis in the asset in each case determined as of the beginning of the tenyear period we will be subject to tax on the gain at the highest regular corporate rate applicable the results described in this paragraph with respect to the recognition of builtin gain assume that the builtin gain assets at the time the builtin gain assets were subject to a conversion transaction either where a “c” corporation elected reit status or a reit acquired the assets from a “c” corporation were not treated as sold to an unrelated party and gain recognized for those properties that are subject to the builtingains tax if triggered by a sale within the tenyear period beginning on the date on which the properties were acquired by us then the potential amount of builtingains tax will be an additional factor when considering a possible sale of the properties see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the builtin gains tax 

  

qualification as a reit 

  

a reit is defined as a corporation trust or association 

  

1 which is managed by one or more trustees or directors 

  

2 the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest 

  

3 which would be taxable as a domestic corporation but for the federal income tax law relating to reits 

  

4 which is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company 

  

5 the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons in each taxable year of the reit except for its first taxable year 

  

6 not more than 50 in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned during the last half of each taxable year excluding its first taxable year directly or indirectly by or for five or fewer individuals which includes certain entities the “five or fewer requirement” and 

  

7 which meets certain income and asset tests described below 

  

conditions 1 to 4 inclusive must be met during the entire taxable year and condition 5 must be met during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months for purposes of conditions 5 and 6 pension funds and certain other taxexempt entities are treated as individuals subject to a “lookthrough” exception in the case of condition 6 

  

based on publicly available information we believe we have satisfied the share ownership requirements set forth in 5 and 6 above in addition article vi of our bylaws provides for restrictions regarding ownership and transfer of shares these restrictions are intended to assist us in continuing to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in 5 and 6 above these restrictions however may not ensure that we will in all cases be able to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in 5 and 6 above 

  

we have complied with and will continue to comply with regulatory rules to send annual letters to certain of our stockholders requesting information regarding the actual ownership of our stock if despite sending the annual letters we do not know or after exercising reasonable diligence would not have known whether we failed to meet the five or fewer requirement we will be treated as having met the five or fewer requirement if we fail to comply with these regulatory rules we will be subject to a monetary 

  

 

  

  

penalty if our failure to comply was due to intentional disregard of the requirement the penalty would be increased however if our failure to comply were due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect no penalty would be imposed 

  

we may own a number of properties through wholly owned subsidiaries a corporation will qualify as a “qualified reit subsidiary” if 100 of its stock is owned by a reit and the reit does not elect to treat the subsidiary as a taxable reit subsidiary a “qualified reit subsidiary” will not be treated as a separate corporation and all assets liabilities and items of income deductions and credits of a “qualified reit subsidiary” will be treated as assets liabilities and items as the case may be of the reit a “qualified reit subsidiary” is not subject to federal income tax and our ownership of the voting stock of a qualified reit subsidiary will not violate the restrictions against ownership of securities of any one issuer which constitute more than 10 of the value or total voting power of such issuer or more than 5 of the value of our total assets as described below under “— asset tests” 

  

if we invest in a partnership a limited liability company or a trust taxed as a partnership or as a disregarded entity we will be deemed to own a proportionate share of the partnership’s limited liability company’s or trust’s assets likewise we will be treated as receiving our share of the income and loss of the partnership limited liability company or trust and the gross income will retain the same character in our hands as it has in the hands of the partnership limited liability company or trust these “lookthrough” rules apply for purposes of the income tests and assets tests described below 

  

income tests there are two separate percentage tests relating to our sources of gross income that we must satisfy for each taxable year 

  

• at least 75 of our gross income excluding gross income from certain sales of property held primarily for sale must be directly or indirectly derived each taxable year from “rents from real property” other income from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property or certain income from qualified temporary investments 

  

• at least 95 of our gross income excluding gross income from certain sales of property held primarily for sale must be directly or indirectly derived each taxable year from any of the sources qualifying for the 75 gross income test and from dividends including dividends from taxable reit subsidiaries and interest 

  

as to transactions entered into in taxable years beginning after october 22 2004 and on or prior to july 30 2008 any of our income from a “clearly identified” hedging transaction that is entered into by us in the normal course of business directly or indirectly to manage the risk of interest rate movements price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings or obligations incurred or to be incurred by us or such other risks that are prescribed by the internal revenue service is excluded from the 95 gross income test 

  

for transactions entered into after july 30 2008 any of our income from a “clearly identified” hedging transaction that is entered into by us in the normal course of business directly or indirectly to manage the risk of interest rate movements price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings or obligations incurred or to be incurred by us is excluded from the 95 and 75 gross income tests 

  

for transactions entered into after july 30 2008 any of our income from a “clearly identified” hedging transaction entered into by us primarily to manage risk of currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain that is included in gross income in the 95 and 75 gross income tests is excluded from the 95 and 75 gross income tests 

  

in general a hedging transaction is “clearly identified” if 1 the transaction is identified as a hedging transaction before the end of the day on which it is entered into and 2 the items or risks being hedged are identified “substantially contemporaneously” with the hedging transaction an identification is not substantially contemporaneous if it is made more than 35 days after entering into the hedging transaction 

  

as to gains and items of income recognized after july 30 2008 “passive foreign exchange gain” for any taxable year will not constitute gross income for purposes of the 95 gross income test and “real estate foreign exchange gain” for any taxable year will not constitute gross income for purposes of the 75 gross income test real estate foreign exchange gain is foreign currency gain as defined in internal revenue code section 988b1 which is attributable to i any qualifying item of income or gain for purposes of the 75 gross income test ii the acquisition or ownership of obligations secured by mortgages on real property or interests in real property or iii becoming or being the obligor under obligations secured by mortgages on real property or on interests in real property real estate foreign exchange gain also includes internal revenue code section 987 gain attributable to a qualified business unit a “qbu” of a reit if the qbu itself meets the 75 income test for the taxable year and the 75 asset test at the close of each quarter that the reit has directly or indirectly held the qbu real estate foreign exchange gain also includes any other foreign currency gain as determined by the secretary of the treasury passive foreign exchange gain includes all real estate foreign exchange 

  

 

  

  

gain and foreign currency gain which is attributable to i any qualifying item of income or gain for purposes of the 95 gross income test ii the acquisition or ownership of obligations iii becoming or being the obligor under obligations and iv any other foreign currency gain as determined by the secretary of the treasury 

  

generally other than income from “clearly identified” hedging transactions entered into by us in the normal course of business any foreign currency gain derived by us from dealing or engaging in substantial and regular trading in securities will constitute gross income which does not qualify under the 95 or 75 gross income tests 

  

rents received by us will qualify as “rents from real property” for purposes of satisfying the gross income tests for a reit only if several conditions are met 

  

• the amount of rent must not be based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person although rents generally will not be excluded merely because they are based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales 

  

• rents received from a tenant will not qualify as rents from real property if the reit or an owner of 10 or more of the reit also directly or constructively owns 10 or more of the tenant unless the tenant is our taxable reit subsidiary and certain other requirements are met with respect to the real property being rented 

  

• if rent attributable to personal property leased in connection with a lease of real property is greater than 15 of the total rent received under the lease then the portion of rent attributable to such personal property will not qualify as “rents from real property” 

  

• for rents to qualify as rents from real property we generally must not furnish or render services to tenants other than through a taxable reit subsidiary or an “independent contractor” from whom we derive no income except that we may directly provide services that are “usually or customarily rendered” in the geographic area in which the property is located in connection with the rental of real property for occupancy only or are not otherwise considered “rendered to the occupant for his convenience” 

  

• for taxable years beginning after july 30 2008 the reit may lease “ qualified health care properties” on an arm’slength basis to a taxable reit subsidiary if the property is operated on behalf of such subsidiary by a person who qualifies as an “independent contractor” and who is or is related to a person who is actively engaged in the trade or business of operating health care facilities for any person unrelated to us or our taxable reit subsidiary an “ eligible independent contractor  ” generally the rent that the reit receives from the taxable reit subsidiary will be treated as “rents from real property”   a “qualified health care property” includes any real property and any personal property that is or is necessary or incidental to the use of a hospital nursing facility assisted living facility congregate care facility qualified continuing care facility or other licensed facility which extends medical or nursing or ancillary services to patients and which is operated by a provider of such services which is eligible for participation in the medicare program with respect to such facility 

  

a reit is permitted to render a de minimis amount of impermissible services to tenants and still treat amounts received with respect to that property as rent from real property the amount received or accrued by the reit during the taxable year for the impermissible services with respect to a property may not exceed 1 of all amounts received or accrued by the reit directly or indirectly from the property the amount received for any service or management operation for this purpose shall be deemed to be not less than 150 of the direct cost of the reit in furnishing or rendering the service or providing the management or operation furthermore impermissible services may be furnished to tenants by a taxable reit subsidiary subject to certain conditions and we may still treat rents received with respect to the property as rent from real property 

  

the term “interest” generally does not include any amount if the determination of the amount depends in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person although an amount generally will not be excluded from the term “interest” solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage of receipts or sales 

  

if we fail to satisfy one or both of the 75 or 95 gross income tests for any taxable year we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for such year if we are eligible for relief these relief provisions generally will be available if 1 following our identification of the failure we file a schedule for such taxable year describing each item of our gross income and 2 the failure to meet such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect 

  

it is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions if these relief provisions apply a 100 tax is imposed on an amount equal to a the gross income attributable to 1 75 of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75 income test and 2 95 of our gross income over the 

  

 

  

  

amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 95 income test multiplied by b a fraction intended to reflect our profitability 

  

the secretary of the treasury is given broad authority to determine whether particular items of income or gain qualify or not under the 75 and 95 gross income tests or are to be excluded from the measure of gross income for such purposes 

  

asset tests within 30 days after the close of each quarter of our taxable year we must also satisfy several tests relating to the nature and diversification of our assets determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles at least 75 of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets cash cash items including receivables arising in the ordinary course of our operation government securities and qualified temporary investments although the remaining 25 of our assets generally may be invested without restriction we are prohibited from owning securities representing more than 10 of either the vote the “10 vote test” or value the “10 value test” of the outstanding securities of any issuer other than a qualified reit subsidiary another reit or a taxable reit subsidiary further no more than 25 of the total assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries the “25 asset test” and no more than 5 of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities of any nongovernmental issuer other than a qualified reit subsidiary the “5 asset test” another reit or a taxable reit subsidiary each of the 10 vote test the 10 value test and the 25 and 5 asset tests must be satisfied at the end of each quarter there are special rules which provide relief if the value related tests are not satisfied due to changes in the value of the assets of a reit 

  

certain items are excluded from the 10 value test including 1 straight debt securities as defined in internal revenue code section 1361c5 of an issuer including straight debt that provides certain contingent payments 2 any loan to an individual or an estate 3 any rental agreement described in section 467 of the internal revenue code other than with a “related person” 4 any obligation to pay rents from real property 5 certain securities issued by a state or any subdivision thereof the district of columbia a foreign government or any political subdivision thereof or the commonwealth of puerto rico 6 any security issued by a reit and 7 any other arrangement that as determined by the secretary of the treasury is excepted from the definition of security “excluded securities” special rules apply to straight debt securities issued by corporations and entities taxable as partnerships for federal income tax purposes if a reit or its taxable reit subsidiary holds 1 straight debt securities of a corporate or partnership issuer and 2 securities of such issuer that are not excluded securities and have an aggregate value greater than 1 of such issuer’s outstanding securities the straight debt securities will be included in the 10 value test 

  

a reit’s interest as a partner in a partnership is not treated as a security for purposes of applying the 10 value test to securities issued by the partnership further any debt instrument issued by a partnership will not be a security for purposes of applying the 10 value test 1 to the extent of the reit’s interest as a partner in the partnership and 2 if at least 75 of the partnership’s gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions would qualify for the 75 gross income test for purposes of the 10 value test a reit’s interest in a partnership’s assets is determined by the reit’s proportionate interest in any securities issued by the partnership other than the excluded securities described in the preceding paragraph 

  

for taxable years beginning after july 30 2008 if the reit or its qbu uses a foreign currency as its functional currency the term “cash” includes such foreign currency but only to the extent such foreign currency is i held for use in the normal course of the activities of the reit or qbu which give rise to items of income or gain that are included in the 95 and 75 gross income tests or are directly related to acquiring or holding assets qualifying under the 75 asset test and ii not held in connection with dealing or engaging in substantial and regular trading in securities 

  

with respect to corrections of failures as to violations of the 10 vote test the 10 value test or the 5 asset test a reit may avoid disqualification as a reit by disposing of sufficient assets to cure a violation that does not exceed the lesser of 1 of the reit’s assets at the end of the relevant quarter or 10000000 provided that the disposition occurs within six months following the last day of the quarter in which the reit first identified the assets for violations of any of the reit asset tests due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that exceed the thresholds described in the preceding sentence a reit can avoid disqualification as a reit after the close of a taxable quarter by taking certain steps including disposition of sufficient assets within the six month period described above to meet the applicable asset test paying a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets during the period of time that the assets were held as nonqualifying assets and filing a schedule with the internal revenue service that describes the nonqualifying assets 

  

investments in taxable reit subsidiaries   reits may own more than 10 of the voting power and value of securities in taxable reit subsidiaries we and any taxable corporate entity in which we own an interest are allowed to jointly elect to treat such entity as a “taxable reit subsidiary” 

  

certain of our subsidiaries have elected to be treated as a taxable reit subsidiary taxable reit subsidiaries are subject to full corporate level federal taxation on their earnings but are permitted to engage in certain types of activities that cannot be performed directly by reits without jeopardizing their reit status our taxable reit subsidiaries will attempt to minimize the amount of these taxes but there can be no assurance whether or the extent to which measures taken to minimize taxes will be successful to the extent 

  

 

  

  

our taxable reit subsidiaries are required to pay federal state or local taxes the cash available for distribution as dividends to us from our taxable reit subsidiaries will be reduced 

  

the amount of interest on relatedparty debt that a taxable reit subsidiary may deduct is limited further a 100 tax applies to any interest payments by a taxable reit subsidiary to its affiliated reit to the extent the interest rate is not commercially reasonable a taxable reit subsidiary is permitted to deduct interest payments to unrelated parties without any of these restrictions 

  

the internal revenue service may reallocate costs between a reit and its taxable reit subsidiary where there is a lack of arm’slength dealing between the parties any deductible expenses allocated away from a taxable reit subsidiary would increase its tax liability further any amount by which a reit understates its deductions and overstates those of its taxable reit subsidiary may subject to certain exceptions be subject to a 100 tax additional taxable reit subsidiary elections may be made in the future for additional entities in which we obtain an interest 

  

annual distribution requirements in order to avoid being taxed as a regular corporation we are required to make distributions other than capital gain distributions to our stockholders which qualify for the dividends paid deduction in an amount at least equal to 1 the sum of i 90 of our “reit taxable income” computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain and ii 90 of the aftertax net income if any from foreclosure property minus 2 a portion of certain items of noncash income these distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for that year and if paid on or before the first regular distribution payment after such declaration the amount distributed must not be preferential this means that every stockholder of the class of stock to which a distribution is made must be treated the same as every other stockholder of that class and no class of stock may be treated otherwise than in accordance with its dividend rights as a class to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our “reit taxable income” as adjusted we will be subject to tax on the undistributed amount at regular corporate tax rates as discussed above we may be subject to an excise tax if we fail to meet certain other distribution requirements we believe we have satisfied the annual distribution requirements for the year of our initial reit election and each year thereafter through the year ended december 31 2012 although we intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy these annual distribution requirements for subsequent years economic market legal tax or other factors could limit our ability to meet those requirements see “item 1a — risk factors” 

  

it is also possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90 distribution requirement or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation due to among other things 1 timing differences between i the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses and ii the inclusion of income and deduction of expenses in arriving at our taxable income or 2 the payment of severance benefits that may not be deductible to us in the event that timing differences occur we may find it necessary to arrange for borrowings or if possible pay dividends in the form of taxable stock dividends in order to meet the distribution requirement 

  

under certain circumstances in the event of a deficiency determined by the internal revenue service we may be able to rectify a resulting failure to meet the distribution requirement for a year by paying “deficiency dividends” to stockholders in a later year which may be included in our deduction for distributions paid for the earlier year thus we may be able to avoid being taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends however we will be required to pay applicable penalties and interest based upon the amount of any deduction taken for deficiency dividend distributions 

  

  failure to qualify as a reit 

  

if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates distributions to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify as a reit will not be deductible nor will any particular amount of distributions be required to be made in any year all distributions to stockholders will be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these distributions and subject to certain limitations will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporate stockholders unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions we also will be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to statutory relief failure to qualify for even one year could result in our need to incur indebtedness or liquidate investments in order to pay potentially significant resulting tax liabilities 

  

in addition to the relief described above under “— income tests” and “— asset tests” relief is available in the event that we violate a provision of the internal revenue code that would result in our failure to qualify as a reit if 1 the violation is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect 2 we pay a penalty of 50000 for each failure to satisfy the provision and 3 the violation does not include a violation described under “— income tests” or “— asset tests” above it is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions 

  

  

 

  

  

federal income taxation of holders of our stock 

  

treatment of taxable us stockholders the following summary applies to you only if you are a “us stockholder” a “us stockholder” is a holder of shares of stock who for united states federal income tax purposes is 

  

• a citizen or resident of the united state s 

  

• a corporation partnership or other entity classified as a corporation or partnership for these purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the united states or of any political subdivision of the united states including any state 

  

• an estate the income of which is subject to united states federal income taxation regardless of its source or 

  

• a trust if in general a us court is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or more us persons within the meaning of the internal revenue code has the authority to control all of the trust’s substantial decisions 

  

so long as we qualify for taxation as a reit distributions on shares of our stock made out of the current or accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these distributions and not designated as capital gain dividends will be includable as ordinary income for federal income tax purposes none of these distributions will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for us corporate stockholders 

  

generally for taxable years following the year ended december 31 2012 the maximum marginal rate of tax payable by individuals on dividends received from corporations that are subject to a corporate level of tax is 20 except in limited circumstances this tax rate will not apply to dividends paid to you by us on our shares because generally we are not subject to federal income tax on the portion of our reit taxable income or capital gains distributed to our stockholders the reduced maximum federal income tax rate will apply to that portion if any of dividends received by you with respect to our shares that are attributable to 1 dividends received by us from nonreit corporations or other taxable reit subsidiaries 2 income from the prior year with respect to which we were required to pay federal corporate income tax during the prior year if for example we did not distribute 100 of our reit taxable income for the prior year or 3 the amount of any earnings and profits that were distributed by us and accumulated in a nonreit year 

  

distributions that are designated as capital gain dividends will be taxed as longterm capital gains to the extent they do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year without regard to the period for which you held our stock however if you are a corporation you may be required to treat a portion of some capital gain dividends as ordinary income 

  

if we elect to retain and pay income tax on any net longterm capital gain you would include in income as longterm capital gain your proportionate share of this net longterm capital gain you would also receive a refundable tax credit for your proportionate share of the tax paid by us on such retained capital gains and you would have an increase in the basis of your shares of our stock in an amount equal to your includable capital gains less your share of the tax deemed paid 

  

you may not include in your federal income tax return any of our net operating losses or capital losses federal income tax rules may also require that certain minimum tax adjustments and preferences be apportioned to you in addition any distribution declared by us in october november or december of any year on a specified date in any such month shall be treated as both paid by us and received by you on december 31 of that year provided that the distribution is actually paid by us no later than january 31 of the following year 

  

we will be treated as having sufficient earnings and profits to treat as a dividend any distribution up to the amount required to be distributed in order to avoid imposition of the 4 excise tax discussed under “— general” and “— qualification as a reit — annual distribution requirements” above as a result you may be required to treat as taxable dividends certain distributions that would otherwise result in a taxfree return of capital moreover any “deficiency dividend” will be treated as a dividend an ordinary dividend or a capital gain dividend as the case may be regardless of our earnings and profits any other distributions in excess of current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to you to the extent these distributions do not exceed the adjusted tax basis of your shares of our stock you will be required to reduce the tax basis of your shares of our stock by the amount of these distributions until the basis has been reduced to zero after which these distributions will be taxable as capital gain if the shares of our stock are held as capital assets the tax basis as so reduced will be used in computing the capital gain or loss if any realized upon sale of the shares of our stock any loss upon a sale or exchange of shares of our stock which were held for six months or less after application of certain holding period rules will generally be treated as a longterm capital loss to the extent you previously received capital gain distributions with respect to these shares of our stock 

  

 

  

  

  

upon the sale or exchange of any shares of our stock to or with a person other than us or a sale or exchange of all shares of our stock whether actually or constructively owned with us you will generally recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your adjusted tax basis in these shares of our stock this gain will be capital gain if you held these shares of our stock as a capital asset 

  

if we redeem any of your shares in us the treatment can only be determined on the basis of particular facts at the time of redemption in general you will recognize gain or loss as opposed to dividend income equal to the difference between the amount received by you in the redemption and your adjusted tax basis in your shares redeemed if such redemption 1 results in a “complete termination” of your interest in all classes of our equity securities 2 is a “substantially disproportionate redemption” or 3 is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” with respect to you in applying these tests you must take into account your ownership of all classes of our equity securities eg common stock preferred stock depositary shares and warrants you also must take into account any equity securities that are considered to be constructively owned by you 

  

if as a result of a redemption by us of your shares you no longer own either actually or constructively any of our equity securities or only own actually and constructively an insubstantial percentage of our equity securities then it is probable that the redemption of your shares would be considered “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” and thus would result in gain or loss to you however whether a distribution is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” depends on all of the facts and circumstances and if you rely on any of these tests at the time of redemption you should consult your tax advisor to determine their application to the particular situation 

  

generally if the redemption does not meet the tests described above then the proceeds received by you from the redemption of your shares will be treated as a distribution taxable as a dividend to the extent of the allocable portion of current or accumulated earnings and profits if the redemption is taxed as a dividend your adjusted tax basis in the redeemed shares will be transferred to any other shareholdings in us that you own if you own no other shareholdings in us under certain circumstances such basis may be transferred to a related person or it may be lost entirely 

  

gain from the sale or exchange of our shares held for more than one year is generally taxed at a maximum longterm capital gain rate of 20 in the case of stockholders who are individuals and 35 in the case of stockholders that are corporations pursuant to internal revenue service guidance we may classify portions of our capital gain dividends as gains eligible for the longterm capital gains rate or as gain taxable to individual stockholders at a maximum rate of 25 capital losses recognized by a stockholder upon the disposition of our shares held for more than one year at the time of disposition will be considered long term capital losses and are generally available only to offset capital gain income of the stockholder but not ordinary income except in the case of individuals who may offset up to 3000 of ordinary income each year 

  

an additional tax of 38 generally will be imposed on the “net investment income” of us stockholders who meet certain requirements and are individuals estates or certain trusts for taxable years beginning after december 31 2012 among other items “net investment income” generally includes gross income from dividends and net gain attributable to the disposition of certain property such as shares of our common stock or warrants in the case of individuals this tax will only apply to the extent such individual’s modified adjusted gross income exceeds 200000 250000 for married couples filing a joint return and surviving spouses and 125000 for married individuals filing a separate return us stockholders should consult their tax advisors regarding the possible applicability of this additional tax in their particular circumstances 

  

treatment of taxexempt us stockholders taxexempt entities including qualified employee pension and profit sharing trusts and individual retirement accounts “exempt organizations” generally are exempt from federal income taxation however they are subject to taxation on their unrelated business taxable income “ubti” the internal revenue service has issued a published revenue ruling that dividend distributions from a reit to an exempt employee pension trust do not constitute ubti provided that the shares of the reit are not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business of the exempt employee pension trust based on this ruling amounts distributed by us to exempt organizations generally should not constitute ubti however if an exempt organization finances its acquisition of the shares of our stock with debt a portion of its income from us will constitute ubti pursuant to the “debt financed property” rules likewise a portion of the exempt organization’s income from us would constitute ubti if we held a residual interest in a real estate mortgage investment conduit 

  

in addition in certain circumstances a pension trust that owns more than 10 of our stock is required to treat a percentage of our dividends as ubti this rule applies to a pension trust holding more than 10 of our stock only if 1 the percentage of our income that is ubti determined as if we were a pension trust is at least 5 2 we qualify as a reit by reason of the modification of the five or fewer requirement that allows beneficiaries of the pension trust to be treated as holding shares in proportion to their actuarial interests in the pension trust and 3 either i one pension trust owns more than 25 of the value of our stock or ii a group of pension trusts individually holding more than 10 of the value of our stock collectively own more than 50 of the value of our stock 

  

 

  

  

  

backup withholding and information reporting under certain circumstances you may be subject to backup withholding at applicable rates on payments made with respect to or cash proceeds of a sale or exchange of shares of our stock backup withholding will apply only if you 1 fail to provide a correct taxpayer identification number which if you are an individual is ordinarily your social security number 2 furnish an incorrect taxpayer identification number 3 are notified by the internal revenue service that you have failed to properly report payments of interest or dividends or 4 fail to certify under penalties of perjury that you have furnished a correct taxpayer identification number and that the internal revenue service has not notified you that you are subject to backup withholding 

  

backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients such as corporations and taxexempt organizations you should consult with a tax advisor regarding qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining an exemption backup withholding is not an additional tax rather the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a stockholder will be allowed as a credit against such stockholder’s united states federal income tax liability and may entitle such stockholder to a refund provided that the required information is provided to the internal revenue service in addition withholding a portion of capital gain distributions made to stockholders may be required for stockholders who fail to certify their nonforeign status 

  

taxation of foreign stockholders the following summary applies to you only if you are a foreign person the federal taxation of foreign persons is a highly complex matter that may be affected by many considerations 

  

except as discussed below distributions to you of cash generated by our real estate operations in the form of ordinary dividends but not by the sale or exchange of our capital assets generally will be subject to us withholding tax at a rate of 30 unless an applicable tax treaty reduces that tax and you file with us the required form evidencing the lower rate 

  

in general you will be subject to united states federal income tax on a graduated rate basis rather than withholding with respect to your investment in our stock if such investment is “effectively connected” with your conduct of a trade or business in the united states a corporate foreign stockholder that receives income that is or is treated as effectively connected with a united states trade or business may also be subject to the branch profits tax which is payable in addition to regular united states corporate income tax the following discussion will apply to foreign stockholders whose investment in us is not so effectively connected we expect to withhold united states income tax as described below on the gross amount of any distributions paid to you unless 1 you file an internal revenue service form w8eci with us claiming that the distribution is “effectively connected” or 2 certain other exceptions apply 

  

distributions by us that are attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a united states real property interest will be taxed to you under the foreign investment in real property tax act of 1980 “firpta” as if these distributions were gains “effectively connected” with a united states trade or business accordingly you will be taxed at the normal capital gain rates applicable to a us stockholder on these amounts subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals distributions subject to firpta may also be subject to a branch profits tax in the hands of a corporate foreign stockholder that is not entitled to treaty exemption 

  

we will be required to withhold from distributions subject to firpta and remit to the internal revenue service 35 of designated capital gain dividends or if greater 35 of the amount of any distributions that could be designated as capital gain dividends in addition if we designate prior distributions as capital gain dividends subsequent distributions up to the amount of the prior distributions not withheld against will be treated as capital gain dividends for purposes of withholding 

  

any capital gain dividend with respect to any class of stock that is “regularly traded” on an established securities market will be treated as an ordinary dividend if the foreign stockholder did not own more than 5 of such class of stock at any time during the taxable year foreign stockholders generally will not be required to report distributions received from us on us federal income tax returns and all distributions treated as dividends for us federal income tax purposes including any such capital gain dividends will be subject to a 30 us withholding tax unless reduced under an applicable income tax treaty as discussed above in addition the branch profits tax will not apply to such distributions 

  

unless our shares constitute a “united states real property interest” within the meaning of firpta or are effectively connected with a us trade or business a sale of our shares by you generally will not be subject to united states taxation our shares will not constitute a united states real property interest if we qualify as a “domestically controlled reit” we believe that we and expect to continue to qualify as a domestically controlled reit a domestically controlled reit is a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50 in value of its shares is held directly or indirectly by foreign stockholders however if you are a nonresident alien individual who is present in the united states for 183 days or more during the taxable year and certain other conditions apply you will be subject to a 30 tax on such capital gains in any event a purchaser of our shares from you will not be required under firpta to withhold on the purchase price if the purchased shares are “regularly traded” on an established securities 

  

 

  

  

market or if we are a domestically controlled reit otherwise under firpta the purchaser may be required to withhold 10 of the purchase price and remit such amount to the internal revenue service 

  

backup withholding tax and information reporting will generally not apply to distributions paid to you outside the united states that are treated as 1 dividends to which the 30 or lower treaty rate withholding tax discussed above applies 2 capital gains dividends or 3 distributions attributable to gain from the sale or exchange by us of us real property interests payment of the proceeds of a sale of stock within the united states or conducted through certain us related financial intermediaries is subject to both backup withholding and information reporting unless the beneficial owner certifies under penalties of perjury that he or she is not a us person and the payor does not have actual knowledge that the beneficial owner is a us person or otherwise established an exemption you may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for refund with the internal revenue service 

  

  withholding tax at a rate of 30 will be imposed on certain payments to you or certain foreign financial institutions including investment funds and other nonus persons receiving payments on your behalf including distributions in respect of shares of our stock and gross proceeds from the sale of shares of our stock if you or such institutions fail to comply with certain due diligence disclosure and reporting rules as set forth in recently issued treasury regulations accordingly the entity through which shares of our stock are held will affect the determination of whether such withholding is required withholding will apply to payments of dividends made after december 31 2013 and to payments of gross proceeds from a sale of shares of our stock made after december 31 2016 stockholders that are otherwise eligible for an exemption from or reduction of us withholding taxes with respect to such dividends and proceeds will be required to seek a refund from the internal revenue service to obtain the benefit of such exemption or reduction additional requirements and conditions may be imposed pursuant to an intergovernmental agreement if and when entered into between the united states and such institution’s home jurisdiction we will not pay any additional amounts to any stockholders in respect of any amounts withheld you are encouraged to consult with your tax advisor regarding us withholding taxes and the application of the recently issued treasury regulations in light of your particular circumstances

conversion or exchange of shares for preferred stock no gain or loss will be recognized upon the withdrawal of preferred stock in exchange for depositary shares and the tax basis of each share of preferred stock will upon exchange be the same as the aggregate tax basis of the depositary shares exchanged if you held your depositary shares as a capital asset at the time of the exchange for shares of preferred stock the holding period for your shares of preferred stock will include the period during which you owned the depositary shares

• the status of the economy 

  

• the status of capital markets including availability and cost of capital

• the movement of us and foreign currency exchange rates 

  

• qualification as a reit 

  

• key management personnel recruitment and retention and 

  

• the risks described below 

  

risk factors related to our operators’ revenues and expenses 

  

our operators’ revenues are primarily driven by occupancy private pay rates and medicare and medicaid reimbursement if applicable expenses for these facilities are primarily driven by the costs of labor food utilities taxes insurance and rent or debt service revenues from government reimbursement have and may continue to come under pressure due to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls operating costs continue to increase for our operators to the extent that any decrease in revenues andor any increase in operating expenses result in a property not generating enough cash to make payments to us the credit of our operator and the value of other collateral would have to be relied upon to the extent the value of such property is reduced we may need to record an impairment for such asset furthermore if we determine to dispose of an underperforming property such sale may result in a loss any such impairment or loss on sale would negatively affect our financial results 

  

the continued weakened economy may have an adverse effect on our operators and tenants including their ability to access credit or maintain occupancy andor private pay rates if the operations cash flows or financial condition of our operators are materially adversely impacted by economic conditions our revenue and operations may be adversely affected 

  

increased competition may affect our operators’ ability to meet their obligations to us 

  

the operators of our properties compete on a local and regional basis with operators of properties and other health care providers that provide comparable services we cannot be certain that the operators of all of our facilities will be able to achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us our operators are expected to encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to attract residents or expand their businesses 

  

risk factors related to obligor bankruptcies 

  

we are exposed to the risk that our obligors may not be able to meet the rent principal and interest or other payments due us which may result in an obligor bankruptcy or insolvency or that an obligor might become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings for other reasons although our operating lease agreements provide us with the right to evict a tenant demand immediate payment of rent and exercise other remedies and our loans provide us with the right to terminate any funding obligation demand immediate repayment of principal and unpaid interest foreclose on the collateral and exercise other remedies the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization an obligor in bankruptcy or subject to insolvency proceedings may be able to limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent in the case of a lease or to receive unpaid principal and interest in the case of a loan and to exercise other rights and remedies 

  

we may be required to fund certain expenses eg real estate taxes and maintenance to preserve the value of an investment property avoid the imposition of liens on a property andor transition a property to a new tenant in some instances we have terminated our lease with a tenant and relet the property to another tenant in some of those situations we have provided working capital loans to and limited indemnification of the new obligor if we cannot transition a leased property to a new tenant we may take possession of that property which may expose us to certain successor liabilities should such events occur our revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely affected 

  

transfers of health care facilities may require regulatory approvals and these facilities may not have efficient alternative uses 

  

transfers of health care facilities to successor operators frequently are subject to regulatory approvals or notifications including but not limited to change of ownership approvals under certificate of need “con” or determination of need laws state licensure laws and medicare and medicaid provider arrangements that are not required for transfers of other types of real estate the replacement of a health care facility operator could be delayed by the approval process of any federal state or local agency necessary for the transfer of the facility or the replacement of the operator licensed to manage the facility alternatively given the specialized nature of our facilities we may be required to spend substantial time and funds to adapt these properties to other uses if we are unable 

  

 

  

  

to timely transfer properties to successor operators or find efficient alternative uses our revenue and operations may be adversely affected 

  

risk factors related to government regulations 

  

some of our obligors’ businesses are affected by government reimbursement to the extent that an operatortenant receives a significant portion of its revenues from government payors primarily medicare and medicaid such revenues may be subject to statutory and regulatory changes retroactive rate adjustments recovery of program overpayments or setoffs court decisions administrative rulings policy interpretations payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers government funding restrictions at a program level or with respect to specific facilities and interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing government investigations and audits at such property in recent years government payors have frozen or reduced payments to health care providers due to budgetary pressures health care reimbursement will likely continue to be of paramount importance to federal and state authorities we cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or effect any future legislative reforms may have on the financial condition of our obligors and properties there can be no assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will be available for services provided by any property operator whether the property receives reimbursement from medicare medicaid or private payors significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on an obligor’s liquidity financial condition and results of operations which could adversely affect the ability of an obligor to meet its obligations to us see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — reimbursement” above 

  

our operators and tenants generally are subject to varying levels of federal state local and industryregulated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with any of these laws regulations or standards could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension decertification or exclusion from federal and state health care programs loss of license or closure of the facility such actions may have an effect on our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make lease payments to us and therefore adversely impact us see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — other related laws” above 

  

many of our properties may require a license registration andor con to operate failure to obtain a license registration or con or loss of a required license registration or con would prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by the operators or tenants these events could materially adversely affect our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make rent payments to us state and local laws also may regulate the expansion including the addition of new beds or services or acquisition of medical equipment and the construction or renovation of health care facilities by requiring a con or other similar approval from a state agency see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — licensing and certification” above 

  

the patient protection and affordable care act of 2010 as modified by the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the “health reform laws” provides states with an increased federal medical assistance percentage under certain conditions on june 28 2012 the united states supreme court upheld the individual mandate of the health reform laws but partially invalidated the expansion of medicaid the ruling on medicaid expansion will allow states not to participate in the expansion—and to forego funding for the medicaid expansion—without losing their existing medicaid funding given that the federal government substantially funds the medicaid expansion it is unclear whether any state will pursue this option although at least some appear to be considering this option at this time the participation by states in the medicaid expansion could have the dual effect of increasing our tenants’ revenues through new patients but further straining state budgets while the federal government will pay for approximately 100 of those additional costs from 2014 to 2016 states will be expected to begin paying for part of those additional costs in 2017 with increasingly strained budgets it is unclear how states will pay their share of these additional medicaid costs and what other health care expenditures could be reduced as a result a significant reduction in other health care related spending by states to pay for increased medicaid costs could affect our tenants’ revenue streams see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — reimbursement” above and “item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—health care industry—health reform laws” below 

  

more generally and because of the dynamic nature of the legislative and regulatory environment for health care products and services and in light of existing federal deficit and budgetary concerns we cannot predict the impact that broadbased farreaching legislative or regulatory changes could have on the us economy our business or that of our tenants 

  

risk factors related to liability claims and insurance costs 

  

in recent years skilled nursing and seniors housing operators have experienced substantial increases in both the number and size of patient care liability claims as a result general and professional liability costs have increased in some markets general and professional liability insurance coverage may be restricted or very costly which may adversely affect the property operators’ future 

  

 

  

  

operations cash flows and financial condition and may have a material adverse effect on the property operators’ ability to meet their obligations to us 

  

unfavorable resolution of pending and future litigation matters and disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

  

from time to time we may be directly involved in a number of legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims we may also be named as defendants in lawsuits allegedly arising out of our actions or the actions of our operatorstenants or managers in which such operatorstenants or managers have agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses an unfavorable resolution of pending or future litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition regardless of its outcome litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of management there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail in or achieve a favorable settlement of pending or future litigation in addition pending litigation or future litigation government proceedings or environmental matters could lead to increased costs or interruption of our normal business operations 

  

risk factors related to acquisitions 

  

we are exposed to the risk that some of our acquisitions may not prove to be successful we could encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired properties including contingent liabilities and acquired properties might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business if we agree to provide construction funding to an operatortenant and the project is not completed we may need to take steps to ensure completion of the project such expenditures may negatively affect our results of operations furthermore there can be no assurance that our anticipated acquisitions and investments the completion of which is subject to various conditions will be consummated in accordance with anticipated timing on anticipated terms or at all 

  

risk factors related to joint ventures 

  

we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into partnerships or joint ventures with other persons or entities joint venture investments involve risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership including the possibility that our partner might become insolvent refuse to make capital contributions when due or otherwise fail to meet its obligations which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments that our partner might at any time have economic or other business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our interests or goals that we could become engaged in a dispute with our partner which could require us to expend additional resources to resolve such disputes and could have an adverse impact on the operations and profitability of the joint venture and that our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests in addition our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted in some instances we andor our partner may have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partner’s interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction our ability to acquire our partner’s interest may be limited if we do not have sufficient cash available borrowing capacity or other capital resources in such event we may be forced to sell our interest in the joint venture when we would otherwise prefer to retain it joint ventures may require us to share decisionmaking authority with our partners which could limit our ability to control the properties in the joint ventures even when we have a controlling interest certain major decisions may require partner approval such as the sale acquisition or financing of a property 

  

risk factors related to our seniors housing operating properties 

  

we are exposed to various operational risks with respect to our seniors housing operating properties that may increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to generate revenues these risks include fluctuations in occupancy medicare and medicaid reimbursement if applicable and private pay rates economic conditions competition federal state local and industryregulated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards the availability and increases in cost of general and professional liability insurance coverage state regulation and rights of residents related to entrance fees the availability and increases in the cost of labor as a result of unionization or otherwise any one or a combination of these factors may adversely affect our revenue and operations 

  

risk factors related to life science facilities 

  

our tenants in the life science industry face high levels of regulation expense and uncertainty that may adversely affect their ability to make payments to us research development and clinical testing of products and technologies can be very expensive and sources of funds may not be available to our life science tenants in the future the products and technologies that are developed and 

  

 

  

  

manufactured by our life science tenants may require regulatory approval prior to being made marketed sold and used the regulatory process can be costly long and unpredictable even after a tenant gains regulatory approval and market acceptance the product still presents regulatory and liability risks such as safety concerns competition from new products and eventually the expiration of patent protection these factors may affect the ability of our life science tenants to make timely payments to us which may adversely affect our revenue and operations 

  

risk factors related to indebtedness 

  

permanent financing for our investments is typically provided through a combination of public offerings of debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt the incurrence or assumption of indebtedness may cause us to become more leveraged which could 1 require us to dedicate a greater portion of our cash flow to the payment of debt service 2 make us more vulnerable to a downturn in the economy 3 limit our ability to obtain additional financing or 4 negatively affect our credit ratings or outlook by one or more of the rating agencies 

  

our debt agreements contain various covenants restrictions and events of default among other things these provisions require us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness create liens and make investments or acquisitions breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness in addition to any other indebtedness crossdefaulted against such instruments these defaults could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

in addition adverse economic conditions may impact the availability of additional funds or could cause the terms on which we are able to borrow additional funds to become unfavorable in those circumstances we may be required to raise additional equity in the capital markets our access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control including rising interest rates inflation and other general market conditions and the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of the shares of our capital stock we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the capital necessary to make future investments or to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature 

  

risk factors related to our credit ratings 

  

we plan to manage the company to maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile but there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity andor financial condition 

  

risk factors related to swaps 

  

we enter into interest rate swap agreements from time to time to manage some of our exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate volatility these swap agreements involve risks such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements in addition these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates when we use forwardstarting interest rate swaps there is a risk that we will not complete the longterm borrowing against which the swap is intended to hedge if such events occur our results of operations may be adversely affected 

  

risk factors related to environmental laws 

  

under various federal and state laws owners or operators of real estate may be required to respond to the presence or release of hazardous substances on the property and may be held liable for property damage personal injuries or penalties that result from environmental contamination or exposure to hazardous substances we may become liable to reimburse the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination generally such liability attaches to a person based on the person’s relationship to the property our tenants or borrowers are primarily responsible for the condition of the property moreover we review environmental site assessments of the properties that we own or encumber prior to taking an interest in them those assessments are designed to meet the “all appropriate inquiry” standard which we believe qualifies us for the innocent purchaser defense if environmental liabilities arise based upon such assessments we do not believe that any of our properties are subject to material environmental contamination however environmental liabilities may be present in our properties and we may incur costs to remediate contamination which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition or the business or financial condition of our obligors 

  

risk factors related to facilities that require entrance fees 

  

  

 

  

  

certain of our seniors housing facilities require the payment of an upfront entrance fee by the resident a portion of which may be refundable by the operator some of these facilities are subject to substantial oversight by state regulators relating to these funds as a result of this oversight residents of these facilities may have a variety of rights including for example the right to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time and certain lien rights the oversight and rights of residents within these facilities may have an effect on the revenue or operations of the operators of such facilities and therefore may negatively impact us 

  

risk factors related to facilities under construction or development 

  

at any given time we may be in the process of constructing one or more new facilities that ultimately will require a con and license before they can be utilized by the operator for their intended use the operator also may need to obtain medicare and medicaid certification and enter into medicare and medicaid provider agreements andor third party payor contracts in the event that the operator is unable to obtain the necessary con licensure certification provider agreements or contracts after the completion of construction there is a risk that we will not be able to earn any revenues on the facility until either the initial operator obtains a license or certification to operate the new facility and the necessary provider agreements or contracts or we find and contract with a new operator that is able to obtain a license to operate the facility for its intended use and the necessary provider agreements or contracts 

  

in connection with our renovation redevelopment development and related construction activities we may be unable to obtain or suffer delays in obtaining necessary zoning landuse building occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations these factors could result in increased costs or our abandonment of these projects in addition we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms which may render us unable to proceed with our development activities and we may not be able to complete construction and leaseup of a property on schedule which could result in increased debt service expense or construction costs 

  

additionally the time frame required for development construction and leaseup of these properties means that we may have to wait years for significant cash returns because we are required to make cash distributions to our stockholders if the cash flow from operations or refinancing is not sufficient we may be forced to borrow additional money to fund such distributions newly developed and acquired properties may not produce the cash flow that we expect which could adversely affect our overall financial performance 

  

in deciding whether to acquire or develop a particular property we make assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property in particular we estimate the return on our investment based on expected occupancy rental rates and capital costs if our financial projections with respect to a new property are inaccurate as a result of increases in capital costs or other factors the property may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment our estimate of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove to be inaccurate which may result in our failure to meet our profitability goals additionally we may acquire new properties that are not fully leased and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with that property 

  

we do not know if our tenants will renew their existing leases and if they do not we may be unable to lease the properties on as favorable terms or at all 

  

we cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases at the end of their lease terms which expire at various times if these leases are not renewed we would be required to find other tenants to occupy those properties or sell them there can be no assurance that we would be able to identify suitable replacement tenants or enter into leases with new tenants on terms as favorable to us as the current leases or that we would be able to lease those properties at all 

  

our ownership of properties through ground leases exposes us to the loss of such properties upon breach or termination of the ground leases 

  

we have acquired an interest in certain of our properties by acquiring a leasehold interest in the property on which the building is located and we may acquire additional properties in the future through the purchase of interests in ground leases as the lessee under a ground lease we are exposed to the possibility of losing the property upon termination of the ground lease or an earlier breach of the ground lease by us 

  

illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties 

  

real estate investments are relatively illiquid our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in economic and other conditions will be limited no assurances can be given that we will recognize full value for any property that we are required to sell for liquidity reasons our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could 

  

 

  

  

adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition we are exposed to the risks inherent in concentrating investments in real estate and in particular the seniors housing and health care industries a downturn in the real estate industry could adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to sell properties for a price or on terms acceptable to us 

  

risk factors related to reinvestment of sale proceeds 

  

from time to time we will have cash available from 1 the proceeds of sales of our securities 2 principal payments on our loans receivable and 3 the sale of properties including nonelective dispositions under the terms of master leases or similar financial support arrangements in order to maintain current revenues and continue generating attractive returns we expect to reinvest these proceeds in a timely manner we compete for real estate investments with a broad variety of potential investors this competition for attractive investments may negatively affect our ability to make timely investments on terms acceptable to us 

  

failure to properly manage our rapid growth could distract our management or increase our expenses 

  

we have experienced rapid growth and development in a relatively short period of time and expect to continue this rapid growth in the future this growth has resulted in increased levels of responsibility for our management future property acquisitions could place significant additional demands on and require us to expand our management resources and personnel our failure to manage any such rapid growth effectively could harm our business and in particular our financial condition results of operations and cash flows which could negatively affect our ability to make distributions to stockholders our growth could also increase our capital requirements which may require us to issue potentially dilutive equity securities and incur additional debt 

  

ownership of property outside the united states may subject us to different or greater risks than those associated with our domestic operations 

  

we have operations in canada and the united kingdom international development ownership and operating activities involve risks that are different from those we face with respect to our domestic properties and operations these risks include but are not limited to any international currency gain recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates may not qualify under the 75 gross income test or the 95 gross income test that we must satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a reit challenges with respect to the repatriation of foreign earnings and cash changes in foreign political regulatory and economic conditions including regionally nationally and locally challenges in managing international operations challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations including those relating to real estate corporate governance operations taxes employment and legal proceedings foreign ownership restrictions with respect to operations in countries differences in lending practices and the willingness of domestic or foreign lenders to provide financing regional or countryspecific business cycles and economic instability and changes in applicable laws and regulations in the united states that affect foreign operations if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with international expansion and operations our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

  

risk factors related to changes in currency exchange rates 

  

as we expand our operations internationally currency exchange rate fluctuations could affect our results of operations and financial position we expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenue and expenses in such foreign currencies as the canadian dollar and the british pound although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions andor obtain local currency mortgage debt in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies we cannot assure you that foreign currency fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on us 

  

we might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

  

we intend to operate as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” and believe we have and will continue to operate in such a manner if we lose our status as a reit we will face serious income tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for satisfying our obligations and for distribution to our stockholders because 

  

• we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rates 

  

• we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes and 

  

• unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions we could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified 

  

 

  

  

  

since reit qualification requires us to meet a number of complex requirements it is possible that we may fail to fulfill them and if we do our earnings will be reduced by the amount of us federal and other income taxes owed a reduction in our earnings would affect the amount we could distribute to our stockholders if we do not qualify as a reit we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders since a nonreit is not required to pay dividends to stockholders in order to maintain reit status or avoid an excise tax see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations” for a discussion of the provisions of the code that apply to us and the effects of failure to qualify as a reit 

  

in addition if we fail to qualify as a reit all distributions to stockholders would continue to be treated as dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits although corporate stockholders may be eligible for the dividends received deduction and individual stockholders may be eligible for taxation at the rates generally applicable to longterm capital gains currently at a maximum rate of 20 with respect to distributions 

  

as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to implement our business strategy and would adversely affect the value of our common stock 

  

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to remain qualified as a reit although we believe that we qualify as a reit we cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify or remain qualified as a reit for us federal income tax purposes see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations” included in this annual report on form 10k 

  

the 90 annual distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions 

  

to comply with the 90 distribution requirement applicable to reits and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax we must make distributions to our stockholders see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations — qualification as a reit — annual distribution requirements” included in this annual report on form 10k although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the reit distribution requirement it is possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90 distribution requirement or we may decide to retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation this may be due to timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses on the one hand and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income on the other hand in addition nondeductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of noncash deductions may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90 distribution requirement in the event that timing differences occur or we deem it appropriate to retain cash we may borrow funds issue additional equity securities although we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so pay taxable stock dividends if possible distribute other property or securities or engage in another transaction intended to enable us to meet the reit distribution requirements this may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations 

  

the lease of qualified health care properties to a taxable reit subsidiary is subject to special requirements 

  

we lease certain qualified health care properties to taxable reit subsidiaries or limited liability companies of which the taxable reit subsidiaries are members which lessees contract with managers or related parties to manage the health care operations at these properties the rents from this taxable reit subsidiary lessee structure are treated as qualifying rents from real property if 1 they are paid pursuant to an armslength lease of a qualified health care property with a taxable reit subsidiary and 2 the manager qualifies as an eligible independent contractor as defined in the code if any of these conditions are not satisfied then the rents will not be qualifying rents see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations — qualification as a reit — income tests” 

  

if certain saleleaseback transactions are not characterized by the internal revenue service as “true leases” we may be subject to adverse tax consequences 

  

we have purchased certain properties and leased them back to the sellers of such properties and we may enter into similar transactions in the future we intend for any such saleleaseback transaction to be structured in such a manner that the lease will be characterized as a “true lease” thereby allowing us to be treated as the owner of the property for us federal income tax purposes however depending on the terms of any specific transaction the internal revenue service might take the position that the transaction is not a “true lease” but is more properly treated in some other manner in the event any saleleaseback transaction is challenged and successfully recharacterized by the internal revenue service we would not be entitled to claim the deductions for depreciation and 

  

 

  

  

cost recovery generally available to an owner of property furthermore if a saleleaseback transaction were so recharacterized we might fail to satisfy the reit asset tests or income tests and consequently could lose our reit status effective with the year of recharacterization see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations — qualification as a reit — asset tests” and “— income tests” alternatively the amount of our reit taxable income could be recalculated which may cause us to fail to meet the reit annual distribution requirements for a taxable year see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations — qualification as a reit — annual distribution requirements” 

  

other risk factors 

  

we are also subject to other risks first our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain antitakeover provisions restrictions on share ownership and transfer and super majority stockholder approval requirements for business combinations that could make it more difficult for or even prevent a third party from acquiring us without the approval of our incumbent board of directors provisions and agreements that inhibit or discourage takeover attempts could reduce the market value of our common stock 

  

additionally we are dependent on key personnel although we have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers losing any one of them could at least temporarily have an adverse impact on our operations we believe that losing more than one could have a material adverse impact on our business

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  we are exposed to various market risks including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we seek to mitigate the underlying foreign currency exposures with gains and losses on derivative contracts hedging these exposures we seek to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates by matching the terms of new investments with new longterm fixed rate borrowings to the extent possible we may or may not elect to use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate exposure these decisions are principally based on our policy to match our variable rate investments with comparable borrowings but are also based on the general trend in interest rates at the applicable dates and our perception of the future volatility of interest rates this section is presented to provide a discussion of the risks associated with potential fluctuations in interest rates 

  we historically borrow on our primary unsecured line of credit arrangement to acquire construct or make loans relating to health care and seniors housing properties then as market conditions dictate we will issue equity or longterm fixed rate debt to repay the borrowings under our unsecured line of credit arrangements 

  a change in interest rates will not affect the interest expense associated with our fixed rate debt interest rate changes however will affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt changes in the interest rate environment upon maturity of this fixed rate debt could have an effect on our future cash flows and earnings depending on whether the debt is replaced with other fixed rate debt variable rate debt or equity or repaid by the sale of assets to illustrate the impact of changes in the interest rate markets we performed a sensitivity analysis on our fixed rate debt instruments whereby we modeled the change in net present values arising from a hypothetical 1 increase in interest rates to determine the instruments’ change in fair value the following table summarizes the analysis performed as of the dates indicated in thousands 

  



  our variable rate debt including our unsecured line of credit arrangements is reflected at fair value at december 31 2012 we had no amounts outstanding related to our variable rate lines of credit and 276006000 outstanding related to our variable rate secured debt assuming no changes in outstanding balances a 1 increase in interest rates would result in increased annual interest expense of 2760000 at december 31 2011 we had 610000000 outstanding related to our variable rate line of credit and 415101000 outstanding related to our variable rate secured debt assuming no changes in outstanding balances a 1 increase in interest rates would have resulted in increased annual interest expense of 10251000 

  see note 11 of our consolidated financial statements for information on our derivative instruments 

  we are subject to risks associated with debt financing including the risk that existing indebtedness may not be refinanced or that the terms of refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of current indebtedness the majority of our borrowings were completed under indentures or contractual agreements that limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur accordingly in the event that we are unable to raise additional equity or borrow money because of these limitations our ability to acquire additional properties may be limited

medical facilities 

  

our medical facilities include medical office buildings hospitals and life science buildings our medical office buildings are typically leased to multiple tenants and generally require a certain level of property management our hospital investments are typically structured similar to our seniors housing triplenet investments our life science investments represent investments in an unconsolidated joint venture entity see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

medical office buildings  the medical office building portfolio consists of health care related buildings that include physician offices ambulatory surgery centers diagnostic facilities outpatient services andor labs our portfolio has a strong affiliation with health systems approximately 87 of our medical office building portfolio is affiliated with health systems by having buildings on hospital campuses or serving as satellite locations for the health system and their physicians 

  

hospitals  our hospitals generally include acute care hospitals inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and longterm acute care hospitals acute care hospitals provide a wide range of inpatient and outpatient services including but not limited to surgery rehabilitation therapy and clinical laboratories inpatient rehabilitation hospitals provide inpatient services for patients with intensive rehabilitation needs longterm acute care hospitals provide inpatient services for patients with complex medical conditions that require more intensive care monitoring or emergency support than is available in most skilled nursing facilities 

  

life science buildings  the life science building portfolio consists of laboratory and office facilities specifically designed and constructed for use by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies these facilities located adjacent to the massachusetts institute of technology which is a well established market known for pharmaceutical and biotechnology research are similar to commercial office buildings with advanced hvac ventilation electrical and mechanical systems 

  

  our medical facilities segment accounted for 24 35 and 33 of total revenues including discontinued operations and our pro rata share of unconsolidated entities for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

  

investments 

  

we invest in seniors housing and health care real estate primarily through acquisitions and developments for additional information regarding acquisition and development activity please see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements we diversify our investment portfolio by property type customer and geographic location in determining whether to invest in a property we focus on the following 1 the experience of the obligor’s management team 2 the historical and projected financial and operational performance of the property 3 the credit of the obligor 4 the security for the lease or loan 5 the real estate attributes of the building and its location and 6 the capital committed to the property by the obligor we conduct market research and analysis for all potential investments in addition we review the value of all properties the interest rates and covenant requirements of any facilitylevel debt to be assumed by us at the time of the acquisition and the anticipated sources of repayment of any of the obligor’s existing debt that is not to be assumed by us at the time of the acquisition 

  

we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property our asset management process for seniors housing triplenet properties generally includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each property periodic review of obligor creditworthiness periodic property inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure real estate taxes letters of credit and other collateral our internal property management division actively manages and monitors the medical office building portfolio with a comprehensive process including tenant relations tenant lease expirations the mix of health service providers hospitalhealth system relationships property performance capital improvement needs and market conditions among other things in monitoring our portfolio our personnel use a proprietary database to collect and analyze propertyspecific data additionally we conduct extensive research to ascertain industry trends and risks 

  

through asset management and research we evaluate the operating environment in each property’s market to determine whether payment risk is likely to increase when we identify unacceptable levels of payment risk we seek to mitigate eliminate or transfer the risk we categorize the risk as obligor property or market risk for obligor risk we typically find a substitute operatortenant to run the property for property risk we usually work with the operatortenant to institute propertylevel management changes to address the risk finally for market risk we often encourage an obligor to change its capital structure including refinancing the property or raising additional equity through these asset management and research efforts we are generally able to intervene at an early stage to address payment risk and in so doing support both the collectability of revenue and the value of our investment 

  

depending upon market conditions we believe that new investments will be available in the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to our stockholders 

  

  

  

  

 

  

investment types 

  

real property our properties are primarily comprised of land building improvements and related rights our hospitals and seniors housing triplenet properties are generally leased to operators under longterm operating leases the leases generally have a fixed contractual term of 12 to 15 years and contain one or more five to 15year renewal options certain of our leases also contain purchase options most of our rents are received under triplenet leases requiring the operator to pay rent and all additional charges incurred in the operation of the leased property the tenants are required to repair rebuild and maintain the leased properties substantially all of these operating leases are designed with either fixed or contingent escalating rent structures leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straightline basis over the initial lease period subject to a collectability assessment rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period 

  

at december 31 2011 approximately 93 of our hospitals and seniors housing triplenet properties were subject to master leases a master lease is a lease of multiple properties to one tenant entity under a single lease agreement from time to time we may acquire additional properties that are then leased to the tenant under the master lease the tenant is required to make one monthly payment that represents rent on all the properties that are subject to the master lease typically the master lease tenant can exercise its right to purchase the properties or to renew the master lease only with respect to all leased properties at the same time this bundling feature benefits us because the tenant cannot limit the purchase or renewal to the better performing properties and terminate the leasing arrangement with respect to the poorer performing properties this spreads our risk among the entire group of properties within the master lease the bundling feature should provide a similar advantage if the master lease tenant is in bankruptcy subject to certain restrictions a debtor in bankruptcy has the right to assume or reject each of its leases it is our intent that a tenant in bankruptcy would be required to assume or reject the master lease as a whole rather than deciding on a property by property basis 

  

our medical office building portfolio is primarily selfmanaged and consists principally of multitenant properties leased to health care providers our leases have favorable lease terms that typically include fixed increasers and some form of operating expense reimbursement by the tenant as of december 31 2011 866 of our portfolio included leases with full pass through 116 with a partial expense reimbursement modified gross and 18 with no expense reimbursement gross our medical office building leases are noncancellable operating leases that have a weighted average remaining term of 84 years at december 31 2011 and are often credit enhanced by guaranties andor letters of credit 

  

construction we currently provide for the construction of properties for tenants generally as part of longterm operating leases we capitalize certain interest costs associated with funds used to pay for the construction of properties owned by us the amount capitalized is based upon the amount advanced during the construction period using the rate of interest that approximates our cost of financing our interest expense is reduced by the amount capitalized we also typically charge a transaction fee at the commencement of construction which we defer and amortize to income over the term of the resulting lease the construction period commences upon funding and terminates upon the earlier of the completion of the applicable property or the end of a specified period during the construction period we advance funds to the tenants in accordance with agreed upon terms and conditions which require among other things periodic site visits by a company representative during the construction period we generally require an additional credit enhancement in the form of payment and performance bonds andor completion guaranties at december 31 2011 we had outstanding construction investments of 189502000 and were committed to providing additional funds of approximately 282899000 to complete construction for investment properties 

  

real estate loans our real estate loans are typically structured to provide us with interest income principal amortization and transaction fees and are generally secured by a first second or third mortgage lien leasehold mortgage corporate guaranties andor personal guaranties at december 31 2011 we had outstanding real estate loans of 292507000 the interest yield averaged approximately 9 per annum on our outstanding real estate loan balances our yield on real estate loans depends upon a number of factors including the stated interest rate average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments the real estate loans outstanding at december 31 2011 are generally subject to three to 20year terms with principal amortization schedules andor balloon payments of the outstanding principal balances at the end of the term typically real estate loans are crossdefaulted and crosscollateralized with other real estate loans operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its affiliates 

  

principles of consolidation 

  

the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our whollyowned subsidiaries and joint venture entities that we control through voting rights or other means all material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation 

  

at inception of the joint venture transactions we identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights “variable interest entities” or “vies” and determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of its operations a variable interest entity is broadly defined as an entity where either i the equity investors as a group if any do not have a controlling financial interest or ii the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entitys activities without additional subordinated financial support we consolidate investments in vies when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary accounting standards 

  

 

  

codification “asc” 810 requires enterprises to perform a qualitative approach to determining whether or not a vie will need to be consolidated on a continuous basis this evaluation is based on an enterprise’s ability to direct and influence the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact that entity’s economic performance 

  

for investments in joint ventures we evaluate the type of rights held by the limited partners which may preclude consolidation in circumstances in which the sole general partner would otherwise consolidate the limited partnership the assessment of limited partners rights and their impact on the presumption of control over a limited partnership by the sole general partner should be made when an investor becomes the sole general partner and should be reassessed if i there is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights of the limited partners ii the sole general partner increases or decreases its ownership in the limited partnership interests or iii there is an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding limited partnership interests we similarly evaluate the rights of managing members of limited liability companies 

  

investments in unconsolidated entities 

  

investments in less than majority owned entities where our interests represent a general partnership interest but substantive participating rights or substantive kickout rights have been granted to the limited partners or where our interests do not represent the general partnership interest and we do not control the major operating and financial policies of the entity are reported under the equity method of accounting under the equity method of accounting our share of the investee’s earnings or losses is included in our consolidated results of operations to the extent that our cost basis is different from the basis reflected at the entity level the basis difference is generally amortized over the lives of the related assets and liabilities and such amortization is included in our share of equity in earnings of the entity the initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated entities is based on the amount paid to purchase the entity interest or the estimated fair value of the assets prior to the sale of interests in the entity other equity investments include an investment in availableforsale securities and an investment in a private company where we do not have the ability to exercise influence over the company so the investment is accounted for under the cost method these equity investments represented a minimal ownership interest in these companies we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the equity method investment to its carrying value when we determine a decline in the estimated fair value of such an investment below its carrying value is otherthantemporary an impairment is recorded 

  

borrowing policies 

  

we utilize a combination of debt and equity to fund investments our debt and equity levels are determined by management to maintain a conservative credit profile generally we intend to issue unsecured fixed rate public debt with longterm maturities to approximate the maturities on our leases and loans for shortterm purposes we may borrow on our unsecured line of credit arrangement we replace these borrowings with longterm capital such as senior unsecured notes common stock or preferred stock when terms are deemed favorable we may invest in properties subject to existing mortgage indebtedness in addition we may obtain secured financing for unleveraged properties in which we have invested or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis in our agreements with our lenders we are subject to restrictions with respect to secured and unsecured indebtedness 

  

competition 

  

we compete with other real estate investment trusts real estate partnerships private equity and hedge fund investors banks insurance companies financeinvestment companies governmentsponsored agencies taxable and taxexempt bond funds health care operators developers and other investors in the acquisition development leasing and financing of health care and seniors housing properties some of our competitors are larger with greater resources and lower costs of capital than us increased competition inhibits our ability to identify and successfully complete investments we compete for investments based on a number of factors including rates financings offered underwriting criteria and reputation our ability to successfully compete is also impacted by economic and population trends availability of acceptable investment opportunities our ability to negotiate beneficial investment terms availability and cost of capital construction and renovation costs and new and existing laws and regulations 

  

the operatorstenants of our properties compete on a local and regional basis with operatorstenants of properties that provide comparable services operatorstenants compete for patients and residents based on a number of factors including quality of care reputation physical appearance of properties services offered family preferences physicians staff and price we also face competition from other health care facilities for tenants such as physicians and other health care providers that provide comparable facilities and services

certain government regulations 

  

health law matters — generally 

  

typically operators of seniors housing facilities do not receive significant funding from government programs and are largely subject to state laws as opposed to federal laws operators of skilled nursing facilities and hospitals do receive significant funding from government programs and these facilities are subject to the federal and state laws that regulate the type and quality of the medical andor nursing care provided ancillary services  eg  respiratory occupational physical and infusion therapies qualifications of the administrative personnel and nursing staff the adequacy of the physical plant and equipment reimbursement and rate setting and operating policies in addition as described below operators of these facilities are subject to extensive laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including but not limited to the federal antikickback statute the federal stark law and the federal false claims act as well as comparable state law counterparts hospitals physician group practice clinics and other health care providers that operate in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal state and local licensure registration certification and inspection laws regulations and industry standards our tenants’ failure to comply with any of these and other laws could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension decertification or exclusion from federal and state health care programs loss of license or closure of the facility 

  

licensing and certification 

  

the primary regulations that affect seniors housing facilities with assisted living are state licensing and registration laws in granting and renewing these licenses the state regulatory agencies consider numerous factors relating to a property’s physical plant and operations including but not limited to admission and discharge standards staffing and training a decision to grant or renew a license is also affected by a property owner’s record with respect to patient and consumer rights medication guidelines and rules certain of the seniors housing facilities mortgaged to or owned by us may require the resident to pay an entrance or upfront fee a portion of which may be refundable these entrance fee communities are subject to significant state regulatory oversight including for example oversight of each facility’s financial condition establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial restrictions the right of residents to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time lien rights in favor of residents restrictions on change of ownership and similar matters such oversight and the rights of residents within these entrance fee communities may have an effect on the revenue or operations of the operators of such facilities and therefore may adversely affect us 

  

certain health care facilities are subject to a variety of licensure and certificate of need “con” laws and regulations where applicable con laws generally require among other requirements that a facility demonstrate the need for 1 constructing a new facility 2 adding beds or expanding an existing facility 3 investing in major capital equipment or adding new services 4 changing the ownership or control of an existing licensed facility or 5 terminating services that have been previously approved through the con process certain state con laws and regulations may restrict the ability of operators to add new properties or expand an existing facility’s size or services in addition con laws may constrain the ability of an operator to transfer responsibility for operating a particular facility to a new operator if we have to replace a property operator who is excluded from participating in a federal or state health care program as discussed below our ability to replace the operator may be affected by a particular state’s con laws regulations and applicable guidance governing changes in provider control 

  

  

 

  

with respect to licensure generally our skilled nursing facilities and acute care facilities are required to be licensed and certified for participation in medicare medicaid and other federal health care programs this generally requires license renewals and compliance surveys on an annual or biannual basis the failure of our operators to maintain or renew any required license or regulatory approval as well as the failure of our operators to correct serious deficiencies identified in a compliance survey could require those operators to discontinue operations at a property in addition if a property is found to be out of compliance with medicare medicaid or other health care program conditions of participation the property operator may be excluded from participating in those government health care programs any such occurrence may impair an operators’ ability to meet their financial obligations to us if we have to replace an excluded property operator our ability to replace the operator may be affected by federal and state laws regulations and applicable guidance governing changes in provider control this may result in payment delays an inability to find a replacement operator a significant working capital commitment from us to a new operator or other difficulties 

  

reimbursement 

  

seniors housing facilities approximately 53 of our overall revenues for the year ended december 31 2011 were attributable to seniors housing facilities the majority of the revenues received by the operators of our seniors housing facilities are from private pay sources the remaining revenue source is primarily medicaid under certain waiver programs as a part of the omnibus budget reconciliation act “obra” of 1981 congress established a waiver program enabling some states to offer medicaid reimbursement to assisted living providers as an alternative to institutional longterm care services the provisions of obra and the subsequent obra acts of 1987 and 1990 permit states to seek a waiver from typical medicaid requirements to develop costeffective alternatives to longterm care including medicaid payments for assisted living and home health as of december 31 2011 seven of our 38 seniors housing operators received medicaid reimbursement pursuant to medicaid waiver programs for the twelve months ended september 30 2011 approximately 5 of the revenues at our seniors housing facilities were from medicaid reimbursement there can be no guarantee that a state medicaid program operating pursuant to a waiver will be able to maintain its waiver status 

  

rates paid by selfpay residents are set by the facilities and are determined by local market conditions and operating costs generally facilities receive a higher payment per day for a private pay resident than for a medicaid beneficiary who requires a comparable level of care the level of medicaid reimbursement varies from state to state thus the revenues generated by operators of our assisted living facilities may be adversely affected by payor mix acuity level changes in medicaid eligibility and reimbursement levels in addition a state could lose its medicaid waiver and no longer be permitted to utilize medicaid dollars to reimburse for assisted living services changes in revenues could in turn have a material adverse effect on an operator’s ability to meet its obligations to us 

  

skilled nursing facilities and hospitals skilled nursing facilities and hospitals typically receive most of their revenues from the medicare and medicaid programs with the balance representing reimbursement payments from private payors including private insurers consequently changes in federal or state reimbursement policies may also adversely affect an operator’s ability to cover its expenses including our rent or debt service skilled nursing facilities and hospitals are subject to periodic pre and postpayment reviews and other audits by federal and state authorities a review or audit of a property operator’s claims could result in recoupments denials or delay of payments in the future which could have a material adverse effect on the operator’s ability to meet its financial obligations to us due to the significant judgments and estimates inherent in payor settlement accounting no assurance can be given as to the adequacy of any reserves maintained by our property operators to cover potential adjustments to reimbursements or to cover settlements made to payors in fact in december 2010 the department of health and human services office of inspector general “oig” released a report focusing on skilled nursing facilities’ billing practices for medicare part a payments and found that between 20062008 skilled nursing facilities increasingly billed for higher paying resource utilization groups “rugs” the payment classification mechanism for the medicare program even though beneficiary characteristics remained largely unchanged in particular from 2006 to 2008 oig found that the percentage of rugs for ultra high therapy increased from 17 to 28 despite the fact that beneficiaries’ ages and diagnoses at admission were largely unchanged during that time period as a result of the recent attention on skilled nursing billing practices and ongoing government pressure to reduce spending by government health care programs government health care programs have reduced rug payments that may be made to skilled nursing facilities for 2012 as discussed in further detail below and as a result an operator’s ability to meet its financial obligations to us may be impaired further reductions in such payments may significantly impair an operator’s ability to meet its financial obligations to us 

  

medicare reimbursement and skilled nursing facilities for the twelve months ended september 30 2011 approximately 32 of the revenues at our skilled nursing facilities which comprised 22 of our overall revenues for the year ended december 31 2011 were paid by medicare skilled nursing facilities are reimbursed under the medicare skilled nursing facility prospective payment system “snf pps” there is a risk that some skilled nursing facilities’ costs will exceed the fixed payments under the snf pps and there is also a risk that payments under the snf pps may be set below the costs to provide certain items and services which could result in immediate financial difficulties for skilled nursing facilities and could cause operators to seek bankruptcy protection skilled nursing facilities have faced these types of difficulties since the implementation of the snf pps 

  

  

 

  

the centers for medicare  medicaid services “cms” an agency of the us department of health and human services “hhs” made a negative payment update for skilled nursing facilities for fiscal year 2012 for fiscal year 2012 skilled nursing facilities received an 111 decrease or 387 billion in rug payments resulting from a 27 market basket update less a 1 multifactor productivity adjustment and a 126 reduction or 447 billion to recalibrate the rugsiv therapy payment rates cms announced that the reasons for this rate reduction were to correct for the unintended spike in payment levels particularly those associated with higher paying rugs and to align reimbursement with cost in addition on november 21 2011 the joint select committee on deficit reduction which was created by the budget control act of 2011 concluded its work and issued a statement that it was not able to make a bipartisan agreement thus triggering the sequestration process the sequestration process will result in spending reductions starting in 2013 including medicare cuts 

  

in addition section 5008 of the deficit reduction act of 2005 directed the secretary of hhs to conduct a post acute care payment reform demonstration “pacprd” program for a three year period beginning january 1 2008 to assess the costs and outcomes of patients discharged from hospitals in a variety of postacute care settings including skilled nursing facilities the demonstration program’s results and recommendations were reported to congress in a january 2012 report the results and recommendations could lead to future changes in medicare coverage reimbursement and reporting requirements for postacute care 

  

the balanced budget act of 1997 mandated caps on medicare reimbursement for certain therapy services however congress imposed various moratoriums on the implementation of those caps for 2012 the annual payment cap of 1880 per patient applies to occupational therapy and a separate 1880 cap applies to speech and physical therapy congress has permitted patients exceeding the cap to obtain additional medicare coverage through a waiver program if the therapy is deemed medically necessary the waiver program was historically extended and was most recently extended through february 29 2012 by the temporary payroll tax cut continuation act of 2011 

  

if the exception expires patients will need to use private funds to pay for the cost of therapy above the caps if patients are unable to satisfy their outofpocket cost responsibility to reimburse an operator for services rendered the operator’s ability to meet its financial obligations to us could be adversely impacted 

  

medicare reimbursement and hospitals for the twelve months ended september 30 2011 approximately 52 of the revenues at our hospitals which comprised 5 of our overall revenues for the year ended december 31 2011 were from medicare reimbursements hospitals generally are reimbursed by medicare under the hospital inpatient prospective payment system “pps” the hospital outpatient prospective payment system “opps” the long term care hospital prospective payment system “ltch pps” or the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system “irf pps” acute care hospitals provide a wide range of inpatient and outpatient services including but not limited to surgery rehabilitation therapy and clinical laboratory services longterm acute care hospitals provide inpatient services for patients with medical conditions that are often complex and that require more intensive care monitoring or emergency support than that available in most skilled nursing facilities inpatient rehabilitation facilities provide intensive rehabilitation services in an inpatient setting for patients requiring at least three hours of rehabilitation services a day 

  

with respect to medicare’s pps for regular hospitals reimbursement for inpatient services is made on the basis of a fixed prospective rate based on the principal diagnosis of the patient hospitals may be at risk to the extent that their costs in treating a specific case exceed the fixed payment amount the diagnosis related group “drg” reimbursement system was updated in 2008 to expand the number of drgs from 538 to 745 in order to better distinguish more severe conditions one additional drg was added in 2009 for a new total of 746 in some cases a hospital might be able to qualify for an outlier payment if the hospital’s losses exceed a threshold 

  

president obama’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2013 which begins october 1 2012 was released on february 13 2012 and has the potential to further impact medicare reimbursement rates by proposing to cut medicare reimbursement to a host of providers including hospitals home health agencies and nursing homes these proposals if implemented could adversely affect our operators and tenants 

  

medicaid reimbursement medicaid is a major payor source for residents in our skilled nursing facilities and hospitals for the twelve months ended september 30 2011 approximately 48 of the revenues of our skilled nursing facilities and 11 of the revenues of our hospitals were attributable to medicaid reimbursement payments the federal and state governments share responsibility for financing medicaid the federal matching rate known as the federal medical assistance percentage “fmap” varies by state based on relative per capita income but is at least 50 in all states on average medicaid is the largest component of total state spending representing approximately 21 of total state spending the percentage of medicaid dollars used for longterm care varies from state to state due in part to different ratios of elderly population and eligibility requirements within certain federal guidelines states have a fairly wide range of discretion to determine eligibility and reimbursement methodology many states reimburse longterm care facilities using fixed daily rates which are applied prospectively based on patient acuity and the historical 

  

 

  

costs incurred in providing patient care reasonable costs typically include allowances for staffing administrative and general expenses property and equipment  eg  real estate taxes depreciation and fair rental 

  

in most states medicaid does not fully reimburse the cost of providing skilled nursing services certain states are attempting to slow the rate of growth in medicaid expenditures by freezing rates or restricting eligibility and benefits as of the beginning of state fiscal year 2011 states in which we have skilled nursing property investments held rates flat on average for the year our skilled nursing portfolio’s average medicaid rate will likely vary throughout the year as states continue to make interim changes to their budgets and medicaid funding in addition medicaid reimbursement rates may decline if revenues in a particular state are not sufficient to fund budgeted expenditures president obama’s proposed fiscal year budget for 2013 released on february 13 2012 includes a proposal to place new limits on state provider taxes that are used to pay the state share of medicaid and has the potential to further impact medicaid reimbursement rates the president’s budget includes a proposal to phase down the medicaid provider tax a tax paid by health care providers to help fund state medicaid programs beginning with a reduction from the current law level of 60 to 45 in fiscal year 2015 the president’s budget also includes a proposal to replace the federal matching rate for state medicaid and the children’s health insurance program with a single matching rate specific to each state if the president’s proposals are implemented the various state medicaid programs will receive less funds which could adversely affect our operators and tenants 

  

the medicare part d drug benefit became effective january 1 2006 since that date lowincome medicare beneficiaries eligible for both medicare and full medicaid benefits including those nursing home residents who are dually eligible for both programs may enroll and receive outpatient prescription drugs under medicare not medicaid medicare part d has resulted in increased administrative responsibilities for nursing home operators because enrollment in medicare part d is voluntary and residents must choose between multiple prescription drug plans operators may also experience increased expenses to the extent that a particular drug prescribed to a patient is not listed on the medicare part d drug plan formulary for the plan in which the patient is enrolled 

  

the reimbursement methodologies applied to health care facilities continue to evolve federal and state authorities have considered and may seek to implement new or modified reimbursement methodologies that may negatively impact health care property operations the impact of any such changes if implemented may result in a material adverse effect on our skilled nursing and hospital property operations no assurance can be given that current revenue sources or levels will be maintained accordingly there can be no assurance that payments under a government health care program are currently or will be in the future sufficient to fully reimburse the property operators for their operating and capital expenses as a result an operator’s ability to meet its financial obligations to us could be adversely impacted 

  

finally the patient protection and affordable care act “ppaca” and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 which amends the ppaca collectively the “health reform laws” further discussed below may have a significant impact on medicare medicaid other federal health care programs and private insurers which impact the reimbursement amounts received by skilled nursing facilities and other health care providers the health reform laws could have a substantial and material adverse effect on all parties directly or indirectly involved in the health care system 

  

other related laws 

  

skilled nursing facilities and hospitals and seniors housing facilities that receive medicaid payments are subject to federal state and local laws regulations and applicable guidance that govern the operations and financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by health care providers certain of these laws prohibit direct or indirect payments of any kind for the purpose of inducing or encouraging the referral of patients for medical products or services reimbursable by government health care programs other laws require providers to furnish only medically necessary services and submit to the government valid and accurate statements for each service still other laws require providers to comply with a variety of safety health and other requirements relating to the condition of the licensed property and the quality of care provided sanctions for violations of these laws regulations and other applicable guidance may include but are not limited to criminal andor civil penalties and fines loss of licensure immediate termination of government payments and exclusion from any government health care program in certain circumstances violation of these rules such as those prohibiting abusive and fraudulent behavior with respect to one property may subject other facilities under common control or ownership to sanctions including exclusion from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs as well as other government health care programs in the ordinary course of its business a property operator is regularly subjected to inquiries investigations and audits by the federal and state agencies that oversee these laws and regulations 

  

all health care providers including but not limited to skilled nursing facilities and hospitals and seniors housing facilities that receives medicaid payments are also subject to the federal antikickback statute which generally prohibits persons from offering providing soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing of a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal health care program such as medicare or medicaid skilled nursing facilities and hospitals are also subject to the federal ethics in patient referral act of 1989 commonly referred to as the stark law the stark law generally prohibits the submission of claims to medicare for payment if the claim results from a physician referral for certain designated services and the physician has a financial relationship with the health service provider that does not qualify under one of 

  

 

  

the exceptions for a financial relationship under the stark law similar prohibitions on physician selfreferrals and submission of claims apply to state medicaid programs further health care providers including but not limited to skilled nursing facilities and hospitals and seniors housing facilities that receive medicaid payments are subject to substantial financial penalties under the civil monetary penalties act and the federal false claims act and in particular actions under the federal false claims act’s “whistleblower” provisions private enforcement of health care fraud has increased due in large part to amendments to the federal false claims act that encourage private individuals to sue on behalf of the government these whistleblower suits brought by private individuals known as qui tam actions may be filed by almost anyone including present and former patients nurses and other employees such whistleblower actions have been brought against nursing facilities on the basis of the alleged failure of the nursing facility to meet applicable regulations relating to its operations significantly if a claim is successfully adjudicated the federal false claims act provides for treble damages up to 11000 per claim 

  

prosecutions investigations or whistleblower actions could have a material adverse effect on a property operator’s liquidity financial condition and operations which could adversely affect the ability of the operator to meet its financial obligations to us finally various state false claim act and antikickback laws may also apply to each property operator violation of any of the foregoing statutes can result in criminal andor civil penalties that could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its financial obligations to us 

  

other legislative developments including the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” have greatly expanded the definition of health care fraud and related offenses and broadened its scope to include private health care plans in addition to government payors congress also has greatly increased funding for the department of justice federal bureau of investigation and the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services to audit investigate and prosecute suspected health care fraud moreover a significant portion of the billions in health care fraud recoveries over the past several years has also been returned to government agencies to further fund their fraud investigation and prosecution efforts 

  

additionally other hipaa provisions and regulations provide for communication of health information through standard electronic transaction formats and for the privacy and security of health information in order to comply with the regulations health care providers often must undertake significant operational and technical implementation efforts operators also may face significant financial exposure if they fail to maintain the privacy and security of medical records and other personal health information about individuals the health information technology for economic and clinical health “hitech” act passed in february 2009 strengthened the hhs secretary’s authority to impose civil money penalties for hipaa violations occurring after february 18 2009 hitech directs the hhs secretary to provide for periodic audits to ensure covered entities and their business associates as that term is defined under hipaa comply with the applicable hitech requirements increasing the likelihood that a hipaa violation will result in an enforcement action cms issued an interim final rule which conformed hipaa enforcement regulations to the hitech act increasing the maximum penalty for multiple violations of a single requirement or prohibition to 15 million higher penalties may accrue for violations of multiple requirements or prohibitions hipaa violations are also potentially subject to criminal penalties 

  

in november 2002 cms began an ongoing national nursing home quality initiative “nhqi” under this initiative historical survey information the nhqi pilot evaluation report and the nhqi overview is made available to the public online the nhqi website provides consumer and provider information regarding the quality of care in nursing homes the data allows consumers providers states and researchers to compare quality information that shows how well nursing homes are caring for their residents’ physical and clinical needs the posted nursing home quality measures come from resident assessment data that nursing homes routinely collect on the residents at specified intervals during their stay if the operators of nursing facilities are unable to achieve quality of care ratings that are comparable or superior to those of their competitors they may lose market share to other facilities reducing their revenues and adversely impacting their ability to make rental payments 

  

finally government investigations and enforcement actions brought against the health care industry have increased dramatically over the past several years and are expected to continue some of these enforcement actions represent novel legal theories and expansions in the application of the federal false claims act the costs for an operator of a health care property associated with both defending such enforcement actions and the undertakings in settling these actions can be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its obligations to us

general 

  

we elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust a “reit” commencing with our first taxable year we intend to continue to operate in such a manner as to qualify as a reit but there is no guarantee that we will qualify or remain qualified as a reit for subsequent years qualification and taxation as a reit depends upon our ability to meet a variety of qualification tests imposed under federal income tax law with respect to income assets distribution level and diversity of share ownership as discussed below under “— qualification as a reit” there can be no assurance that we will be owned and organized and will operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified 

  

in any year in which we qualify as a reit in general we will not be subject to federal income tax on that portion of our reit taxable income or capital gain that is distributed to stockholders we may however be subject to tax at normal corporate rates on any taxable income or capital gain not distributed if we elect to retain and pay income tax on our net longterm capital gain stockholders are required to include their proportionate share of our undistributed longterm capital gain in income but they will receive a refundable credit for their share of any taxes paid by us on such gain 

  

despite the reit election we may be subject to federal income and excise tax as follows 

  

• to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our “reit taxable income” as adjusted we will be subject to tax on the undistributed amount at regular corporate tax rates 

  

• we may be subject to the “alternative minimum tax” the “amt” on certain tax preference items to the extent that the amt exceeds our regular tax 

  

• if we have net income from the sale or other disposition of “foreclosure property” that is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business or other nonqualifying income from foreclosure property such income will be taxed at the highest corporate rate 

  

• any net income from prohibited transactions which are in general sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business other than dispositions of foreclosure property and dispositions of property due to an involuntary conversion will be subject to a 100 tax 

  

• if we fail to satisfy either the 75 or 95 gross income tests as discussed below but nonetheless maintain our qualification as a reit because certain other requirements are met we will be subject to a 100 tax on an amount equal to 1 the gross income attributable to the greater of i 75 of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75 gross income test discussed below or ii 95 of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 95 gross income test discussed below multiplied by 2 a fraction intended to reflect our profitability 

  

• if we fail to distribute during each year at least the sum of 1 85 of our reit ordinary income for the year 2 95 of our reit capital gain net income for such year other than capital gain that we elect to retain and pay tax on and 3 any undistributed taxable income from preceding periods we will be subject to a 4 excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over amounts actually distributed and 

  

• we will be subject to a 100 tax on the amount of any rents from real property deductions or excess interest paid to us by any of our “taxable reit subsidiaries” that would be reduced through reallocation under certain federal income tax principles in order to more clearly reflect income of the taxable reit subsidiary see “— qualification as a reit — investments in taxable reit subsidiaries” 

  

• we may be subject to the corporate “alternative minimum tax” on any items of tax preference including any deductions of net operating losses 

  

  

 

  

if we acquire any assets from a corporation which is or has been a “c” corporation in a carryover basis transaction we could be liable for specified liabilities that are inherited from the “c” corporation a “c” corporation is generally defined as a corporation that is required to pay full corporate level federal income tax if we recognize gain on the disposition of the assets during the tenyear period beginning on the date on which the assets were acquired by us then to the extent of the assets’ “builtin gain” ie the excess of the fair market value of the asset over the adjusted tax basis in the asset in each case determined as of the beginning of the tenyear period we will be subject to tax on the gain at the highest regular corporate rate applicable the results described in this paragraph with respect to the recognition of builtin gain assume that the builtin gain assets at the time the builtin gain assets were subject to a conversion transaction either where a “c” corporation elected reit status or a reit acquired the assets from a “c” corporation were not treated as sold to an unrelated party and gain recognized for the twelve months ending december 31 2011 we acquired 135 assets with builtin gain that could be subject to builtin gains tax if disposed of prior to december 2021 for those properties that are subject to the builtingains tax if triggered by a sale within the tenyear period beginning on the date on which the properties were acquired by us then the potential amount of builtingains tax will be an additional factor when considering a possible sale of the properties see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the builtin gains tax 

  

qualification as a reit 

  

a reit is defined as a corporation trust or association 

  

1 which is managed by one or more trustees or directors 

  

2 the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest 

  

3 which would be taxable as a domestic corporation but for the federal income tax law relating to reits 

  

4 which is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company 

  

5 the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons in each taxable year of the reit except for its first taxable year 

  

6 not more than 50 in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned during the last half of each taxable year excluding its first taxable year directly or indirectly by or for five or fewer individuals which includes certain entities the “five or fewer requirement” and 

  

7 which meets certain income and asset tests described below 

  

conditions 1 to 4 inclusive must be met during the entire taxable year and condition 5 must be met during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months for purposes of conditions 5 and 6 pension funds and certain other taxexempt entities are treated as individuals subject to a “lookthrough” exception in the case of condition 6 

  

based on publicly available information we believe we have satisfied the share ownership requirements set forth in 5 and 6 above in addition article vi of our bylaws provides for restrictions regarding ownership and transfer of shares these restrictions are intended to assist us in continuing to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in 5 and 6 above these restrictions however may not ensure that we will in all cases be able to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in 5 and 6 above 

  

we have complied with and will continue to comply with regulatory rules to send annual letters to certain of our stockholders requesting information regarding the actual ownership of our stock if despite sending the annual letters we do not know or after exercising reasonable diligence would not have known whether we failed to meet the five or fewer requirement we will be treated as having met the five or fewer requirement if we fail to comply with these regulatory rules we will be subject to a monetary penalty if our failure to comply was due to intentional disregard of the requirement the penalty would be increased however if our failure to comply were due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect no penalty would be imposed 

  

we may own a number of properties through wholly owned subsidiaries a corporation will qualify as a “qualified reit subsidiary” if 100 of its stock is owned by a reit and the reit does not elect to treat the subsidiary as a taxable reit subsidiary a “qualified reit subsidiary” will not be treated as a separate corporation and all assets liabilities and items of income deductions and credits of a “qualified reit subsidiary” will be treated as assets liabilities and items as the case may be of the reit a “qualified reit subsidiary” is not subject to federal income tax and our ownership of the voting stock of a qualified reit subsidiary will not violate the restrictions against ownership of securities of any one issuer which constitute more than 10 of the value or total voting power of such issuer or more than 5 of the value of our total assets as described below under “— asset tests” 

  

 

  

  

if we invest in a partnership a limited liability company or a trust taxed as a partnership or as a disregarded entity we will be deemed to own a proportionate share of the partnership’s limited liability company’s or trust’s assets likewise we will be treated as receiving our share of the income and loss of the partnership limited liability company or trust and the gross income will retain the same character in our hands as it has in the hands of the partnership limited liability company or trust these “lookthrough” rules apply for purposes of the income tests and assets tests described below 

  

income tests there are two separate percentage tests relating to our sources of gross income that we must satisfy for each taxable year 

  

• at least 75 of our gross income excluding gross income from certain sales of property held primarily for sale must be directly or indirectly derived each taxable year from “rents from real property” other income from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property or certain income from qualified temporary investments 

  

• at least 95 of our gross income excluding gross income from certain sales of property held primarily for sale must be directly or indirectly derived each taxable year from any of the sources qualifying for the 75 gross income test and from dividends including dividends from taxable reit subsidiaries and interest 

  

as to transactions entered into in taxable years beginning after october 22 2004 any of our income from a “clearly identified” hedging transaction that is entered into by us in the normal course of business directly or indirectly to manage the risk of interest rate movements price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings or obligations incurred or to be incurred by us or such other risks that are prescribed by the internal revenue service is excluded from the 95 gross income test 

  

for transactions entered into after july 30 2008 any of our income from a “clearly identified” hedging transaction that is entered into by us in the normal course of business directly or indirectly to manage the risk of interest rate movements price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings or obligations incurred or to be incurred by us is excluded from the 95 and 75 gross income tests 

  

for transactions entered into after july 30 2008 any of our income from a “clearly identified” hedging transaction entered into by us primarily to manage risk of currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain that is included in gross income in the 95 and 75 gross income tests is excluded from the 95 and 75 gross income tests 

  

in general a hedging transaction is “clearly identified” if 1 the transaction is identified as a hedging transaction before the end of the day on which it is entered into and 2 the items or risks being hedged are identified “substantially contemporaneously” with the hedging transaction an identification is not substantially contemporaneous if it is made more than 35 days after entering into the hedging transaction 

  

as to gains and items of income recognized after july 30 2008 “passive foreign exchange gain” for any taxable year will not constitute gross income for purposes of the 95 gross income test and “real estate foreign exchange gain” for any taxable year will not constitute gross income for purposes of the 75 gross income test real estate foreign exchange gain is foreign currency gain as defined in internal revenue code section 988b1 which is attributable to i any qualifying item of income or gain for purposes of the 75 gross income test ii the acquisition or ownership of obligations secured by mortgages on real property or interests in real property or iii becoming or being the obligor under obligations secured by mortgages on real property or on interests in real property real estate foreign exchange gain also includes internal revenue code section 987 gain attributable to a qualified business unit a “qbu” of a reit if the qbu itself meets the 75 income test for the taxable year and the 75 asset test at the close of each quarter that the reit has directly or indirectly held the qbu real estate foreign exchange gain also includes any other foreign currency gain as determined by the secretary of the treasury passive foreign exchange gain includes all real estate foreign exchange gain and foreign currency gain which is attributable to i any qualifying item of income or gain for purposes of the 95 gross income test ii the acquisition or ownership of obligations iii becoming or being the obligor under obligations and iv any other foreign currency gain as determined by the secretary of the treasury 

  

generally other than income from “clearly identified” hedging transactions entered into by us in the normal course of business any foreign currency gain derived by us from dealing or engaging in substantial and regular trading in securities will constitute gross income which does not qualify under the 95 or 75 gross income tests 

  

rents received by us will qualify as “rents from real property” for purposes of satisfying the gross income tests for a reit only if several conditions are met 

  

• the amount of rent must not be based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person although rents generally will not be excluded merely because they are based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales 

  

 

  

  

• rents received from a tenant will not qualify as rents from real property if the reit or an owner of 10 or more of the reit also directly or constructively owns 10 or more of the tenant unless the tenant is our taxable reit subsidiary and certain other requirements are met with respect to the real property being rented 

  

• if rent attributable to personal property leased in connection with a lease of real property is greater than 15 of the total rent received under the lease then the portion of rent attributable to such personal property will not qualify as “rents from real property” 

  

• for rents to qualify as rents from real property we generally must not furnish or render services to tenants other than through a taxable reit subsidiary or an “independent contractor” from whom we derive no income except that we may directly provide services that are “usually or customarily rendered” in the geographic area in which the property is located in connection with the rental of real property for occupancy only or are not otherwise considered “rendered to the occupant for his convenience” 

  

• for taxable years beginning after july 30 2008 the reit may lease “ qualified health care properties” on an arm’slength basis to a taxable reit subsidiary if the property is operated on behalf of such subsidiary by a person who qualifies as an “independent contractor” and who is or is related to a person who is actively engaged in the trade or business of operating health care facilities for any person unrelated to us or our taxable reit subsidiary an “ eligible independent contractor  ” generally the rent that the reit receives from the taxable reit subsidiary will be treated as “rents from real property”   a “qualified health care property” includes any real property and any personal property that is or is necessary or incidental to the use of a hospital nursing facility assisted living facility congregate care facility qualified continuing care facility or other licensed facility which extends medical or nursing or ancillary services to patients and which is operated by a provider of such services which is eligible for participation in the medicare program with respect to such facility 

  

a reit is permitted to render a de minimis amount of impermissible services to tenants and still treat amounts received with respect to that property as rent from real property the amount received or accrued by the reit during the taxable year for the impermissible services with respect to a property may not exceed 1 of all amounts received or accrued by the reit directly or indirectly from the property the amount received for any service or management operation for this purpose shall be deemed to be not less than 150 of the direct cost of the reit in furnishing or rendering the service or providing the management or operation furthermore impermissible services may be furnished to tenants by a taxable reit subsidiary subject to certain conditions and we may still treat rents received with respect to the property as rent from real property 

  

the term “interest” generally does not include any amount if the determination of the amount depends in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person although an amount generally will not be excluded from the term “interest” solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage of receipts or sales 

  

if we fail to satisfy one or both of the 75 or 95 gross income tests for any taxable year we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for such year if we are eligible for relief these relief provisions generally will be available if 1 following our identification of the failure we file a schedule for such taxable year describing each item of our gross income and 2 the failure to meet such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect 

  

it is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions if these relief provisions apply a 100 tax is imposed on an amount equal to a the gross income attributable to 1 75 of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75 income test and 2 95 of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 95 income test multiplied by b a fraction intended to reflect our profitability 

  

the secretary of the treasury is given broad authority to determine whether particular items of income or gain qualify or not under the 75 and 95 gross income tests or are to be excluded from the measure of gross income for such purposes 

  

asset tests within 30 days after the close of each quarter of our taxable year we must also satisfy several tests relating to the nature and diversification of our assets determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles at least 75 of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets cash cash items including receivables arising in the ordinary course of our operation government securities and qualified temporary investments although the remaining 25 of our assets generally may be invested without restriction we are prohibited from owning securities representing more than 10 of either the vote the “10 vote test” or value the “10 value test” of the outstanding securities of any issuer other than a qualified reit subsidiary another reit or a taxable reit subsidiary further no more than 25 of the total assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries the “25 asset test” and no more than 5 of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities of any nongovernmental issuer other than a qualified reit subsidiary the “5 asset test” another reit or a taxable reit subsidiary each of the 10 vote test the 10 value test and the 25 and 5 asset tests must be satisfied at the end of each 

  

 

  

quarter there are special rules which provide relief if the value related tests are not satisfied due to changes in the value of the assets of a reit 

  

certain items are excluded from the 10 value test including 1 straight debt securities of an issuer including straight debt that provides certain contingent payments 2 any loan to an individual or an estate 3 any rental agreement described in section 467 of the internal revenue code other than with a “related person” 4 any obligation to pay rents from real property 5 certain securities issued by a state or any subdivision thereof the district of columbia a foreign government or any political subdivision thereof or the commonwealth of puerto rico 6 any security issued by a reit and 7 any other arrangement that as determined by the secretary of the treasury is excepted from the definition of security “excluded securities” special rules apply to straight debt securities issued by corporations and entities taxable as partnerships for federal income tax purposes if a reit or its taxable reit subsidiary holds 1 straight debt securities of a corporate or partnership issuer and 2 securities of such issuer that are not excluded securities and have an aggregate value greater than 1 of such issuer’s outstanding securities the straight debt securities will be included in the 10 value test 

  

a reit’s interest as a partner in a partnership is not treated as a security for purposes of applying the 10 value test to securities issued by the partnership further any debt instrument issued by a partnership will not be a security for purposes of applying the 10 value test 1 to the extent of the reit’s interest as a partner in the partnership and 2 if at least 75 of the partnership’s gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions would qualify for the 75 gross income test for purposes of the 10 value test a reit’s interest in a partnership’s assets is determined by the reit’s proportionate interest in any securities issued by the partnership other than the excluded securities described in the preceding paragraph 

  

for taxable years beginning after july 30 2008 if the reit or its qbu uses a foreign currency as its functional currency the term “cash” includes such foreign currency but only to the extent such foreign currency is i held for use in the normal course of the activities of the reit or qbu which give rise to items of income or gain that are included in the 95 and 75 gross income tests or are directly related to acquiring or holding assets qualifying under the 75 asset test and ii not held in connection with dealing or engaging in substantial and regular trading in securities 

  

with respect to corrections of failures as to violations of the 10 vote test the 10 value test or the 5 asset test a reit may avoid disqualification as a reit by disposing of sufficient assets to cure a violation that does not exceed the lesser of 1 of the reit’s assets at the end of the relevant quarter or 10000000 provided that the disposition occurs within six months following the last day of the quarter in which the reit first identified the assets for violations of any of the reit asset tests due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that exceed the thresholds described in the preceding sentence a reit can avoid disqualification as a reit after the close of a taxable quarter by taking certain steps including disposition of sufficient assets within the six month period described above to meet the applicable asset test paying a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets during the period of time that the assets were held as nonqualifying assets and filing a schedule with the internal revenue service that describes the nonqualifying assets 

  

investments in taxable reit subsidiaries   reits may own more than 10 of the voting power and value of securities in taxable reit subsidiaries we and any taxable corporate entity in which we own an interest are allowed to jointly elect to treat such entity as a “taxable reit subsidiary” 

  

certain of our subsidiaries have elected to be treated as a taxable reit subsidiary taxable reit subsidiaries are subject to full corporate level federal taxation on their earnings but are permitted to engage in certain types of activities that cannot be performed directly by reits without jeopardizing their reit status our taxable reit subsidiaries will attempt to minimize the amount of these taxes but there can be no assurance whether or the extent to which measures taken to minimize taxes will be successful to the extent our taxable reit subsidiaries are required to pay federal state or local taxes the cash available for distribution as dividends to us from our taxable reit subsidiaries will be reduced 

  

the amount of interest on relatedparty debt that a taxable reit subsidiary may deduct is limited further a 100 tax applies to any interest payments by a taxable reit subsidiary to its affiliated reit to the extent the interest rate is not commercially reasonable a taxable reit subsidiary is permitted to deduct interest payments to unrelated parties without any of these restrictions 

  

the internal revenue service may reallocate costs between a reit and its taxable reit subsidiary where there is a lack of arm’slength dealing between the parties any deductible expenses allocated away from a taxable reit subsidiary would increase its tax liability further any amount by which a reit understates its deductions and overstates those of its taxable reit subsidiary will subject to certain exceptions be subject to a 100 tax additional taxable reit subsidiary elections may be made in the future for additional entities in which we own an interest 

  

annual distribution requirements in order to avoid being taxed as a regular corporation we are required to make distributions other than capital gain distributions to our stockholders which qualify for the dividends paid deduction in an amount at least equal to 1 the sum of i 90 of our “reit taxable income” computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain and ii 90 of the aftertax net income if any from foreclosure property minus 2 a portion of certain items of noncash income these distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if declared before 

  

 

  

we timely file our tax return for that year and if paid on or before the first regular distribution payment after such declaration the amount distributed must not be preferential this means that every stockholder of the class of stock to which a distribution is made must be treated the same as every other stockholder of that class and no class of stock may be treated otherwise than in accordance with its dividend rights as a class to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our “reit taxable income” as adjusted we will be subject to tax on the undistributed amount at regular corporate tax rates finally as discussed above we may be subject to an excise tax if we fail to meet certain other distribution requirements we intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy these annual distribution requirements 

  

it is possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90 distribution requirement or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation due to among other things 1 timing differences between i the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses and ii the inclusion of income and deduction of expenses in arriving at our taxable income or 2 the payment of severance benefits that may not be deductible to us in the event that timing differences occur we may find it necessary to arrange for borrowings or if possible pay dividends in the form of taxable stock dividends in order to meet the distribution requirement 

  

under certain circumstances in the event of a deficiency determined by the internal revenue service we may be able to rectify a resulting failure to meet the distribution requirement for a year by paying “deficiency dividends” to stockholders in a later year which may be included in our deduction for distributions paid for the earlier year thus we may be able to avoid being taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends however we will be required to pay applicable penalties and interest based upon the amount of any deduction taken for deficiency dividend distributions 

  

the internal revenue service issued revenue procedure 200868 which provided temporary relief to publicly traded reits seeking to preserve liquidity by electing cashstock dividends under revenue procedure 200868 a reit may treat the entire dividend including the stock portion as a taxable dividend distribution thereby qualifying for the dividendspaid deduction provided certain requirements are satisfied the cash portion of the dividend may be as low as 10 revenue procedure 200868 as amplified by revenue procedure 201012 applies to dividends declared on or before december 31 2012 and with respect to a taxable year ending on or before december 31 2011 

  

failure to qualify as a reit 

  

if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates distributions to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify as a reit will not be deductible nor will any particular amount of distributions be required to be made in any year all distributions to stockholders will be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these distributions and subject to certain limitations will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporate stockholders unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions we also will be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to statutory relief failure to qualify for even one year could result in our need to incur indebtedness or liquidate investments in order to pay potentially significant resulting tax liabilities 

  

in addition to the relief described above under “— income tests” and “— asset tests” relief is available in the event that we violate a provision of the internal revenue code that would result in our failure to qualify as a reit if 1 the violation is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect 2 we pay a penalty of 50000 for each failure to satisfy the provision and 3 the violation does not include a violation described under “— income tests” or “— asset tests” above it is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions 

  

federal income taxation of holders of our stock 

  

treatment of taxable us stockholders the following summary applies to you only if you are a “us stockholder” a “us stockholder” is a holder of shares of stock who for united states federal income tax purposes is 

  

• a citizen or resident of the united states 

  

• a corporation partnership or other entity classified as a corporation or partnership for these purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the united states or of any political subdivision of the united states including any state 

  

• an estate the income of which is subject to united states federal income taxation regardless of its source or 

  

• a trust if in general a us court is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or more us persons within the meaning of the internal revenue code has the authority to control all of the trust’s substantial decisions 

  

 

  

  

so long as we qualify for taxation as a reit distributions on shares of our stock made out of the current or accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these distributions and not designated as capital gain dividends will be includable as ordinary income for federal income tax purposes none of these distributions will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for us corporate stockholders 

  

generally for taxable years ending after may 6 2003 through december 31 2012 the maximum marginal rate of tax payable by individuals on dividends received from corporations that are subject to a corporate level of tax is 15 except in limited circumstances this tax rate will not apply to dividends paid to you by us on our shares because generally we are not subject to federal income tax on the portion of our reit taxable income or capital gains distributed to our stockholders the reduced maximum federal income tax rate will apply to that portion if any of dividends received by you with respect to our shares that are attributable to 1 dividends received by us from nonreit corporations or other taxable reit subsidiaries 2 income from the prior year with respect to which we were required to pay federal corporate income tax during the prior year if for example we did not distribute 100 of our reit taxable income for the prior year or 3 the amount of any earnings and profits that were distributed by us and accumulated in a nonreit year 

  

distributions that are designated as capital gain dividends will be taxed as longterm capital gains to the extent they do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year without regard to the period for which you held our stock however if you are a corporation you may be required to treat a portion of some capital gain dividends as ordinary income 

  

if we elect to retain and pay income tax on any net longterm capital gain you would include in income as longterm capital gain your proportionate share of this net longterm capital gain you would also receive a refundable tax credit for your proportionate share of the tax paid by us on such retained capital gains and you would have an increase in the basis of your shares of our stock in an amount equal to your includable capital gains less your share of the tax deemed paid 

  

you may not include in your federal income tax return any of our net operating losses or capital losses federal income tax rules may also require that certain minimum tax adjustments and preferences be apportioned to you in addition any distribution declared by us in october november or december of any year on a specified date in any such month shall be treated as both paid by us and received by you on december 31 of that year provided that the distribution is actually paid by us no later than january 31 of the following year 

  

we will be treated as having sufficient earnings and profits to treat as a dividend any distribution up to the amount required to be distributed in order to avoid imposition of the 4 excise tax discussed under “— general” and “— qualification as a reit — annual distribution requirements” above as a result you may be required to treat as taxable dividends certain distributions that would otherwise result in a taxfree return of capital moreover any “deficiency dividend” will be treated as a dividend an ordinary dividend or a capital gain dividend as the case may be regardless of our earnings and profits any other distributions in excess of current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to you to the extent these distributions do not exceed the adjusted tax basis of your shares of our stock you will be required to reduce the tax basis of your shares of our stock by the amount of these distributions until the basis has been reduced to zero after which these distributions will be taxable as capital gain if the shares of our stock are held as capital assets the tax basis as so reduced will be used in computing the capital gain or loss if any realized upon sale of the shares of our stock any loss upon a sale or exchange of shares of our stock which were held for six months or less after application of certain holding period rules will generally be treated as a longterm capital loss to the extent you previously received capital gain distributions with respect to these shares of our stock 

  

upon the sale or exchange of any shares of our stock to or with a person other than us or a sale or exchange of all shares of our stock whether actually or constructively owned with us you will generally recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your adjusted tax basis in these shares of our stock this gain will be capital gain if you held these shares of our stock as a capital asset 

  

if we redeem any of your shares in us the treatment can only be determined on the basis of particular facts at the time of redemption in general you will recognize gain or loss as opposed to dividend income equal to the difference between the amount received by you in the redemption and your adjusted tax basis in your shares redeemed if such redemption 1 results in a “complete termination” of your interest in all classes of our equity securities 2 is a “substantially disproportionate redemption” or 3 is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” with respect to you in applying these tests you must take into account your ownership of all classes of our equity securities eg common stock preferred stock depositary shares and warrants you also must take into account any equity securities that are considered to be constructively owned by you 

  

if as a result of a redemption by us of your shares you no longer own either actually or constructively any of our equity securities or only own actually and constructively an insubstantial percentage of our equity securities then it is probable that the redemption of your shares would be considered “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” and thus would result in gain or loss to you however 

  

 

  

whether a distribution is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” depends on all of the facts and circumstances and if you rely on any of these tests at the time of redemption you should consult your tax advisor to determine their application to the particular situation 

  

generally if the redemption does not meet the tests described above then the proceeds received by you from the redemption of your shares will be treated as a distribution taxable as a dividend to the extent of the allocable portion of current or accumulated earnings and profits if the redemption is taxed as a dividend your adjusted tax basis in the redeemed shares will be transferred to any other shareholdings in us that you own if you own no other shareholdings in us under certain circumstances such basis may be transferred to a related person or it may be lost entirely 

  

gain from the sale or exchange of our shares held for more than one year is generally taxed at a maximum longterm capital gain rate of 15 through 2012 in the case of stockholders who are individuals and 35 in the case of stockholders that are corporations pursuant to internal revenue service guidance we may classify portions of our capital gain dividends as gains eligible for the longterm capital gains rate or as gain taxable to individual stockholders at a maximum rate of 25 capital losses recognized by a stockholder upon the disposition of our shares held for more than one year at the time of disposition will be considered long term capital losses and are generally available only to offset capital gain income of the stockholder but not ordinary income except in the case of individuals who may offset up to 3000 of ordinary income each year 

  

on march 30 2010 the president signed into law the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 which requires us stockholders who meet certain requirements and are individuals estates or certain trusts to pay an additional 38 tax on among other things dividends on and capital gains from the sale or other disposition of stock for taxable years beginning after december 31 2012 us stockholders should consult their tax advisors regarding the effect if any of this legislation on their ownership and disposition of shares of our stock 

  

treatment of taxexempt us stockholders taxexempt entities including qualified employee pension and profit sharing trusts and individual retirement accounts “exempt organizations” generally are exempt from federal income taxation however they are subject to taxation on their unrelated business taxable income “ubti” the internal revenue service has issued a published revenue ruling that dividend distributions from a reit to an exempt employee pension trust do not constitute ubti provided that the shares of the reit are not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business of the exempt employee pension trust based on this ruling amounts distributed by us to exempt organizations generally should not constitute ubti however if an exempt organization finances its acquisition of the shares of our stock with debt a portion of its income from us will constitute ubti pursuant to the “debt financed property” rules likewise a portion of the exempt organization’s income from us would constitute ubti if we held a residual interest in a real estate mortgage investment conduit 

  

in addition in certain circumstances a pension trust that owns more than 10 of our stock is required to treat a percentage of our dividends as ubti this rule applies to a pension trust holding more than 10 of our stock only if 1 the percentage of our income that is ubti determined as if we were a pension trust is at least 5 2 we qualify as a reit by reason of the modification of the five or fewer requirement that allows beneficiaries of the pension trust to be treated as holding shares in proportion to their actuarial interests in the pension trust and 3 either i one pension trust owns more than 25 of the value of our stock or ii a group of pension trusts individually holding more than 10 of the value of our stock collectively own more than 50 of the value of our stock 

  

backup withholding and information reporting under certain circumstances you may be subject to backup withholding at applicable rates on payments made with respect to or cash proceeds of a sale or exchange of shares of our stock backup withholding will apply only if you 1 fail to provide a correct taxpayer identification number which if you are an individual is ordinarily your social security number 2 furnish an incorrect taxpayer identification number 3 are notified by the internal revenue service that you have failed to properly report payments of interest or dividends or 4 fail to certify under penalties of perjury that you have furnished a correct taxpayer identification number and that the internal revenue service has not notified you that you are subject to backup withholding 

  

backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients such as corporations and taxexempt organizations you should consult with a tax advisor regarding qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining an exemption backup withholding is not an additional tax rather the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a stockholder will be allowed as a credit against such stockholder’s united states federal income tax liability and may entitle such stockholder to a refund provided that the required information is provided to the internal revenue service in addition withholding a portion of capital gain distributions made to stockholders may be required for stockholders who fail to certify their nonforeign status 

  

taxation of foreign stockholders the following summary applies to you only if you are a foreign person the federal taxation of foreign persons is a highly complex matter that may be affected by many considerations 

  

except as discussed below distributions to you of cash generated by our real estate operations in the form of ordinary dividends but not by the sale or exchange of our capital assets generally will be subject to us withholding tax at a rate of 30 unless an applicable tax treaty reduces that tax and you file with us the required form evidencing the lower rate 

  

 

  

  

in general you will be subject to united states federal income tax on a graduated rate basis rather than withholding with respect to your investment in our stock if such investment is “effectively connected” with your conduct of a trade or business in the united states a corporate foreign stockholder that receives income that is or is treated as effectively connected with a united states trade or business may also be subject to the branch profits tax which is payable in addition to regular united states corporate income tax the following discussion will apply to foreign stockholders whose investment in us is not so effectively connected we expect to withhold united states income tax as described below on the gross amount of any distributions paid to you unless 1 you file an internal revenue service form w8eci with us claiming that the distribution is “effectively connected” or 2 certain other exceptions apply 

  

distributions by us that are attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a united states real property interest will be taxed to you under the foreign investment in real property tax act of 1980 “firpta” as if these distributions were gains “effectively connected” with a united states trade or business accordingly you will be taxed at the normal capital gain rates applicable to a us stockholder on these amounts subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals distributions subject to firpta may also be subject to a branch profits tax in the hands of a corporate foreign stockholder that is not entitled to treaty exemption 

  

we will be required to withhold from distributions subject to firpta and remit to the internal revenue service 35 of designated capital gain dividends or if greater 35 of the amount of any distributions that could be designated as capital gain dividends in addition if we designate prior distributions as capital gain dividends subsequent distributions up to the amount of the prior distributions not withheld against will be treated as capital gain dividends for purposes of withholding 

  

any capital gain dividend with respect to any class of stock that is “regularly traded” on an established securities market will be treated as an ordinary dividend if the foreign stockholder did not own more than 5 of such class of stock at any time during the taxable year foreign stockholders generally will not be required to report distributions received from us on us federal income tax returns and all distributions treated as dividends for us federal income tax purposes including any such capital gain dividends will be subject to a 30 us withholding tax unless reduced under an applicable income tax treaty as discussed above in addition the branch profits tax will not apply to such distributions 

  

unless our shares constitute a “united states real property interest” within the meaning of firpta or are effectively connected with a us trade or business a sale of our shares by you generally will not be subject to united states taxation our shares will not constitute a united states real property interest if we qualify as a “domestically controlled reit” we believe that we and expect to continue to qualify as a domestically controlled reit a domestically controlled reit is a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50 in value of its shares is held directly or indirectly by foreign stockholders however if you are a nonresident alien individual who is present in the united states for 183 days or more during the taxable year and certain other conditions apply you will be subject to a 30 tax on such capital gains in any event a purchaser of our shares from you will not be required under firpta to withhold on the purchase price if the purchased shares are “regularly traded” on an established securities market or if we are a domestically controlled reit otherwise under firpta the purchaser may be required to withhold 10 of the purchase price and remit such amount to the internal revenue service 

  

backup withholding tax and information reporting will generally not apply to distributions paid to you outside the united states that are treated as 1 dividends to which the 30 or lower treaty rate withholding tax discussed above applies 2 capital gains dividends or 3 distributions attributable to gain from the sale or exchange by us of us real property interests payment of the proceeds of a sale of stock within the united states or conducted through certain us related financial intermediaries is subject to both backup withholding and information reporting unless the beneficial owner certifies under penalties of perjury that he or she is not a us person and the payor does not have actual knowledge that the beneficial owner is a us person or otherwise established an exemption you may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for refund with the internal revenue service 

  

recently enacted legislation will impose us withholding tax at a rate of 30 after december 31 2013 on dividends in respect of and after december 31 2014 on gross proceeds from the sale of shares of our stock held by or through certain foreign financial institutions including investment funds unless such institution enters into an agreement with the secretary of the treasury to report on an annual basis information with respect to shares in the institution held by certain us persons and by certain nonus entities that are wholly or partially owned by us persons and to withhold on certain payments accordingly the entity through which shares of stock is held will affect the determination of whether such withholding is required similarly dividends in respect of and gross proceeds from the sale of shares of our stock held by an investor that is a nonfinancial nonus entity will be subject to withholding at a rate of 30 unless such entity either i certifies to us that such entity does not have any substantial united states owners or ii provides certain information regarding the entitys substantial united states owners which we will in turn provide to the secretary of the treasury if payment of withholding taxes is required stockholders that are otherwise eligible for an exemption from or reduction of us withholding taxes with respect to such dividends and proceeds will be required to seek a refund from the internal revenue service to obtain the benefit of such exemption or reduction we will not pay any additional amounts to any stockholders in

risk factors related to our operators’ revenues and expenses 

  

our operators’ revenues are primarily driven by occupancy medicare and medicaid reimbursement if applicable and private pay rates expenses for these facilities are primarily driven by the costs of labor food utilities taxes insurance and rent or debt service revenues from government reimbursement have and may continue to come under pressure due to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls operating costs continue to increase for our operators to the extent that any decrease in revenues andor any increase in operating expenses result in a property not generating enough cash to make payments to us the credit of our operator and the value of other collateral would have to be relied upon 

  

the continued weakened economy may have an adverse effect on our operators and tenants including their ability to access credit or maintain occupancy rates if the operations cash flows or financial condition of our operators are materially adversely impacted by economic conditions our revenue and operations may be adversely affected 

  

increased competition may affect our operators’ ability to meet their obligations to us 

  

the operators of our properties compete on a local and regional basis with operators of properties and other health care providers that provide comparable services we cannot be certain that the operators of all of our facilities will be able to achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us our operators are expected to encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to attract residents or expand their businesses 

  

risk factors related to obligor bankruptcies 

  

we are exposed to the risk that our obligors may not be able to meet the rent principal and interest or other payments due us which may result in an obligor bankruptcy or insolvency or that an obligor might become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings for other reasons although our operating lease agreements provide us with the right to evict a tenant demand immediate payment of rent and exercise other remedies and our loans provide us with the right to terminate any funding obligation demand immediate repayment of principal and unpaid interest foreclose on the collateral and exercise other remedies the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization an obligor in bankruptcy or subject to insolvency 

  

 

  

proceedings may be able to limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent in the case of a lease or to receive unpaid principal and interest in the case of a loan and to exercise other rights and remedies 

  

we may be required to fund certain expenses eg real estate taxes and maintenance to preserve the value of an investment property avoid the imposition of liens on a property andor transition a property to a new tenant in some instances we have terminated our lease with a tenant and relet the property to another tenant in some of those situations we have provided working capital loans to and limited indemnification of the new obligor if we cannot transition a leased property to a new tenant we may take possession of that property which may expose us to certain successor liabilities should such events occur our revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely affected 

  

transfers of health care facilities may require regulatory approvals and these facilities may not have efficient alternative uses 

  

transfers of health care facilities to successor operators frequently are subject to regulatory approvals or notifications including but not limited to change of ownership approvals under certificate of need “con” or determination of need laws state licensure laws and medicare and medicaid provider arrangements that are not required for transfers of other types of real estate the replacement of a health care facility operator could be delayed by the approval process of any federal state or local agency necessary for the transfer of the facility or the replacement of the operator licensed to manage the facility alternatively given the specialized nature of our facilities we may be required to spend substantial time and funds to adapt these properties to other uses if we are unable to timely transfer properties to successor operators or find efficient alternative uses our revenue and operations may be adversely affected 

  

risk factors related to government regulations 

  

our obligors’ businesses are affected by government reimbursement and private payor rates to the extent that an operatortenant receives a significant portion of its revenues from government payors primarily medicare and medicaid such revenues may be subject to statutory and regulatory changes retroactive rate adjustments recovery of program overpayments or setoffs administrative rulings policy interpretations payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers government funding restrictions at a program level or with respect to specific facilities and interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing government investigations and audits at such property in recent years government payors have frozen or reduced payments to health care providers due to budgetary pressures health care reimbursement will likely continue to be of paramount importance to federal and state authorities we cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or effect any future legislative reforms may have on the financial condition of our obligors and properties there can be no assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will be available for services provided by any property operator whether the property receives reimbursement from medicare medicaid or private payors significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on an obligor’s liquidity financial condition and results of operations which could adversely affect the ability of an obligor to meet its obligations to us see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — reimbursement” above 

  

our operators and tenants generally are subject to extensive federal state local and industryregulated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with any of these laws regulations or standards could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension or decertification from federal and state health care programs loss of license or closure of the facility such actions may have an effect on our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make lease payments to us and therefore adversely impact us see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — other related laws” above 

  

many of our properties may require a license registration andor con to operate failure to obtain a license registration or con or loss of a required license registration or con would prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by the operators or tenants these events could materially adversely affect our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make rent payments to us state and local laws also may regulate the expansion including the addition of new beds or services or acquisition of medical equipment and the construction or renovation of health care facilities by requiring a con or other similar approval from a state agency see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — licensing and certification” above 

  

the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 “arra” which was signed into law on february 17 2009 provided 87 billion in additional federal medicaid funding for states’ medicaid expenditures between october 1 2008 and december 31 2010 on august 10 2010 the president signed into law hr 1586 which mandated a sixmonth extension of the increase in federal medicaid funding for states through june 30 2011 although the enhanced federal medicaid funding was scaled back for the first two quarters of 2011 under both the arra and hr 1586 states meeting certain eligibility requirements temporarily received additional money in the form of an increase in the federal medical assistance percentage “fmap” thus for a limited period of time the share of medicaid costs that were paid for by the federal government went up and each state’s share went down no similar extension of increased matching has been offered since june 30 2011 and states’ fmap rates have returned to levels comparable to prearra rates we cannot predict whether states are or will remain eligible to receive the additional federal medicaid funding or whether the 

  

 

  

states will have sufficient funds for their medicaid programs we also cannot predict the impact that such broadbased farreaching legislation will have on the us economy or our business 

  

risk factors related to liability claims and insurance costs 

  

in recent years skilled nursing and seniors housing operators have experienced substantial increases in both the number and size of patient care liability claims as a result general and professional liability costs have increased in some markets general and professional liability insurance coverage may be restricted or very costly which may adversely affect the property operators’ future operations cash flows and financial condition and may have a material adverse effect on the property operators’ ability to meet their obligations to us 

  

risk factors related to acquisitions 

  

we are exposed to the risk that some of our acquisitions may not prove to be successful we could encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired properties including contingent liabilities and acquired properties might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business if we agree to provide construction funding to an operatortenant and the project is not completed we may need to take steps to ensure completion of the project moreover if we issue equity securities or incur additional debt or both to finance future acquisitions it may reduce our per share financial results these costs may negatively affect our results of operations 

  

unfavorable resolution of pending and future litigation matters and disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

  

from time to time we may be directly involved in a number of legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims we may also be named as defendants in lawsuits allegedly arising out of our actions or the actions of our operatorstenants or managers in which such operatorstenants or managers have agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses an unfavorable resolution of pending or future litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition regardless of its outcome litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of management there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail in or achieve a favorable settlement of pending or future litigation in addition pending litigation or future litigation government proceedings or environmental matters could lead to increased costs or interruption of our normal business operations 

  

risk factors related to joint ventures 

  

we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into partnerships or joint ventures with other persons or entities joint venture investments involve risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership including the possibility that our partner might become insolvent refuse to make capital contributions when due or otherwise fail to meet its obligations which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments that our partner might at any time have economic or other business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our interests or goals that we could become engaged in a dispute with our partner which could require us to expend additional resources to resolve such disputes and could have an adverse impact on the operations and profitability of the joint venture and that our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests in addition our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted in some instances we andor our partner may have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partner’s interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction our ability to acquire our partner’s interest may be limited if we do not have sufficient cash available borrowing capacity or other capital resources in such event we may be forced to sell our interest in the joint venture when we would otherwise prefer to retain it joint ventures may require us to share decisionmaking authority with our partners which could limit our ability to control the properties in the joint ventures even when we have a controlling interest certain major decisions may require partner approval such as the sale acquisition or financing of a property 

  

risk factors related to our seniors housing operating properties 

  

we are exposed to various operational risks with respect to our seniors housing operating properties that may increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to generate revenues these risks include fluctuations in occupancy medicare and medicaid reimbursement if applicable and private pay rates economic conditions competition federal state local and industryregulated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards the availability and increases in cost of general and professional liability insurance coverage state regulation and rights of residents related to entrance fees the availability and increases in cost of labor as a result of unionization or otherwise any one or a combination of these factors may adversely affect our revenue and operations 

  

  

 

  

risk factors related to life science facilities 

  

our tenants in the life science industry face high levels of regulation expense and uncertainty that may adversely affect their ability to make payments to us research development and clinical testing of products and technologies can be very expensive and sources of funds may not be available to our life sciences tenants in the future the products and technologies that are developed and manufactured by our life science tenants may require regulatory approval prior to being made marketed sold and used the regulatory process can be costly long and unpredictable even after a tenant gains regulatory approval and market acceptance the product still presents regulatory and liability risks such as safety concerns competition from new products and eventually the expiration of patent protection these factors may affect the ability of our life sciences tenants to make timely payments to us which may adversely affect our revenue and operations 

  

risk factors related to indebtedness 

  

permanent financing for our investments is typically provided through a combination of public and private offerings of debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt the incurrence or assumption of indebtedness may cause us to become more leveraged which could 1 require us to dedicate a greater portion of our cash flow to the payment of debt service 2 make us more vulnerable to a downturn in the economy 3 limit our ability to obtain additional financing or 4 negatively affect our credit ratings or outlook by one or more of the rating agencies 

  

our debt agreements contain various covenants restrictions and events of default among other things these provisions require us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness create liens and make investments or acquisitions breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness in addition to any other indebtedness crossdefaulted against such instruments these defaults could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

risk factors related to our credit ratings 

  

we plan to manage the company to maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile but there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity andor financial condition 

  

risk factors related to interest rate swaps 

  

we enter into interest rate swap agreements from time to time to manage some of our exposure to interest rate volatility these swap agreements involve risks such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements in addition these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates when we use forwardstarting interest rate swaps there is a risk that we will not complete the longterm borrowing against which the swap is intended to hedge if such events occur our results of operations may be adversely affected 

  

risk factors related to environmental laws 

  

under various federal and state laws owners or operators of real estate may be required to respond to the presence or release of hazardous substances on the property and may be held liable for property damage personal injuries or penalties that result from environmental contamination or exposure to hazardous substances we may become liable to reimburse the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination generally such liability attaches to a person based on the person’s relationship to the property our tenants or borrowers are primarily responsible for the condition of the property moreover we review environmental site assessments of the properties that we own or encumber prior to taking an interest in them those assessments are designed to meet the “all appropriate inquiry” standard which we believe qualifies us for the innocent purchaser defense if environmental liabilities arise based upon such assessments we do not believe that any of our properties are subject to material environmental contamination however environmental liabilities may be present in our properties and we may incur costs to remediate contamination which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition or the business or financial condition of our obligors 

  

risk factors related to facilities that require entrance fees 

  

certain of our seniors housing facilities require the payment of an upfront entrance fee by the resident a portion of which may be refundable by the operator some of these facilities are subject to substantial oversight by state regulators relating to these funds as a result of this oversight residents of these facilities may have a variety of rights including for example the right to cancel their 

  

 

  

contracts within a specified period of time and certain lien rights the oversight and rights of residents within these facilities may have an effect on the revenue or operations of the operators of such facilities and therefore may negatively impact us 

  

risk factors related to facilities under construction or development 

  

at any given time we may be in the process of constructing one or more new facilities that ultimately will require a con and license before they can be utilized by the operator for their intended use the operator also may need to obtain medicare and medicaid certification and enter into medicare and medicaid provider agreements andor third party payor contracts in the event that the operator is unable to obtain the necessary con licensure certification provider agreements or contracts after the completion of construction there is a risk that we will not be able to earn any revenues on the facility until either the initial operator obtains a license or certification to operate the new facility and the necessary provider agreements or contracts or we find and contract with a new operator that is able to obtain a license to operate the facility for its intended use and the necessary provider agreements or contracts 

  

in connection with our renovation redevelopment development and related construction activities we may be unable to obtain or suffer delays in obtaining necessary zoning landuse building occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations these factors could result in increased costs or our abandonment of these projects in addition we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms which may render us unable to proceed with our development activities and we may not be able to complete construction and leaseup of a property on schedule which could result in increased debt service expense or construction costs 

  

additionally the time frame required for development construction and leaseup of these properties means that we may have to wait years for significant cash returns because we are required to make cash distributions to our stockholders if the cash flow from operations or refinancing is not sufficient we may be forced to borrow additional money to fund such distributions newly developed and acquired properties may not produce the cash flow that we expect which could adversely affect our overall financial performance 

  

in deciding whether to acquire or develop a particular property we make assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property in particular we estimate the return on our investment based on expected occupancy and rental rates if our financial projections with respect to a new property are inaccurate and the property is unable to achieve the expected occupancy and rental rates it may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment our estimate of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove to be inaccurate which may result in our failure to meet our profitability goals additionally we may acquire new properties that are not fully leased and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with that property 

  

we do not know if our tenants will renew their existing leases and if they do not we may be unable to lease the properties on as favorable terms or at all 

  

we cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases at the end of their lease terms which expire at various times if these leases are not renewed we would be required to find other tenants to occupy those properties or sell them there can be no assurance that we would be able to identify suitable replacement tenants or enter into leases with new tenants on terms as favorable to us as the current leases or that we would be able to lease those properties at all 

  

our ownership of properties through ground leases exposes us to the loss of such properties upon breach or termination of the ground leases 

  

we have acquired an interest in certain of our properties by acquiring a leasehold interest in the property on which the building is located and we may acquire additional properties in the future through the purchase of interests in ground leases as the lessee under a ground lease we are exposed to the possibility of losing the property upon termination of the ground lease or an earlier breach of the ground lease by us 

  

illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties 

  

real estate investments are relatively illiquid our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in economic and other conditions will be limited no assurances can be given that we will recognize full value for any property that we are required to sell for liquidity reasons our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition we are exposed to the risks inherent in concentrating investments in real estate and in particular the seniors housing and health care industries a downturn in the real estate industry could adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to sell properties for a price or on terms acceptable to us 

  

risk factors related to reinvestment of sale proceeds 

  

 

  

  

from time to time we will have cash available from 1 the proceeds of sales of our securities 2 principal payments on our loans receivable and 3 the sale of properties including nonelective dispositions under the terms of master leases or similar financial support arrangements in order to maintain current revenues and continue generating attractive returns we expect to reinvest these proceeds in a timely manner we compete for real estate investments with a broad variety of potential investors this competition for attractive investments may negatively affect our ability to make timely investments on terms acceptable to us 

  

failure to properly manage our rapid growth could distract our management or increase our expenses 

  

we have experienced rapid growth and development in a relatively short period of time and expect to continue this rapid growth in the future this growth has resulted in increased levels of responsibility for our management future property acquisitions could place significant additional demands on and require us to expand our management resources and personnel our failure to manage any such rapid growth effectively could harm our business and in particular our financial condition results of operations and cash flows which could negatively affect our ability to make distributions to stockholders our growth could also increase our capital requirements which may require us to issue potentially dilutive equity securities and incur additional debt 

  

ownership of property outside the united states may subject us to different or greater risks than those associated with our domestic operations 

  

international development ownership and operating activities involve risks that are different from those we face with respect to our domestic properties and operations these risks include but are not limited to any international currency gain recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates may not qualify under the 75 gross income test or the 95 gross income test that we must satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a reit challenges with respect to the repatriation of foreign earnings and cash changes in foreign political regulatory and economic conditions including regionally nationally and locally challenges in managing international operations challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations including those relating to real estate corporate governance operations taxes employment and legal proceedings foreign ownership restrictions with respect to operations in countries differences in lending practices and the willingness of domestic or foreign lenders to provide financing regional or countryspecific business cycles and economic instability and changes in applicable laws and regulations in the united states that affect foreign operations if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with international expansion and operations our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

  

risk factors related to changes in currency exchange rates 

  

as we expand our operations internationally currency exchange rate fluctuations could affect our results of operations and financial position we expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenue and expenses in such foreign currencies as the canadian dollar although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions andor obtain local currency mortgage debt in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies we cannot assure you that foreign currency fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on us 

  

we might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

  

we intend to operate as a reit under the internal revenue code and believe we have and will continue to operate in such a manner if we lose our status as a reit we will face serious income tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for satisfying our obligations and for distribution to our stockholders because 

  

• we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rates 

  

• we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes and 

  

• unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions we could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified 

  

since reit qualification requires us to meet a number of complex requirements it is possible that we may fail to fulfill them and if we do our earnings will be reduced by the amount of us federal and other income taxes owed a reduction in our earnings would affect the amount we could distribute to our stockholders if we do not qualify as a reit we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders since a nonreit is not required to pay dividends to stockholders in order to maintain reit status or avoid an excise tax see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations” for a discussion of the provisions of the internal revenue code that apply to us and the effects of failure to qualify as a reit 

  

  

 

  

in addition if we fail to qualify as a reit all distributions to stockholders would continue to be treated as dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits although corporate stockholders may be eligible for the dividends received deduction and individual stockholders may be eligible for taxation at the rates generally applicable to longterm capital gains currently at a maximum rate of 15 with respect to distributions 

  

as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to implement our business strategy and would adversely affect the value of our common stock 

  

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to remain qualified as a reit although we believe that we qualify as a reit we cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify or remain qualified as a reit for us federal income tax purposes see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations” included in this annual report on form 10k 

  

the 90 annual distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions 

  

to comply with the 90 distribution requirement applicable to reits and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax we must make distributions to our stockholders see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations — qualification as a reit — annual distribution requirements” included in this annual report on form 10k although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the reit distribution requirement it is possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90 distribution requirement or we may decide to retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation this may be due to timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses on the one hand and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income on the other hand in addition nondeductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of noncash deductions may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90 distribution requirement in the event that timing differences occur or we deem it appropriate to retain cash we may borrow funds issue additional equity securities although we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so pay taxable stock dividends if possible distribute other property or securities or engage in another transaction intended to enable us to meet the reit distribution requirements this may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations 

  

the amount of additional indebtedness we may incur is limited by the terms of our line of credit arrangement and the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes in addition adverse economic conditions may impact the availability of additional funds or could cause the terms on which we are able to borrow additional funds to become unfavorable in those circumstances we may be required to raise additional equity in the capital markets our access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control including rising interest rates inflation and other general market conditions and the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of the shares of our capital stock we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the capital necessary to make future investments or to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature 

  

the lease of qualified health care properties to a taxable reit subsidiary is subject to special requirements 

  

we lease certain qualified health care properties we acquire to taxable reit subsidiaries or limited liability companies of which the taxable reit subsidiaries are members which lessees contract with managers or related parties to manage the health care operations at these properties the rents from this taxable reit subsidiary lessee structure are treated as qualifying rents from real property if 1 they are paid pursuant to an armslength lease of a qualified health care property with a taxable reit subsidiary and 2 the manager qualifies as an eligible independent contractor if any of these conditions are not satisfied then the rents will not be qualifying rents see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations — qualification as a reit — income tests” 

  

if certain saleleaseback transactions are not characterized by the internal revenue service as “true leases” we may be subject to adverse tax consequences 

  

we have purchased certain properties and leased them back to the sellers of such properties and we may enter similar transactions in the future we intend for any such saleleaseback transaction to be structured in such a manner that the lease will be characterized as a “true lease” thereby allowing us to be treated as the owner of the property for us federal income tax purposes however depending on the terms of any specific transaction the internal revenue service might take the position that the transaction is not a “true lease” but is more properly treated in some other manner in the event any saleleaseback transaction is challenged and successfully recharacterized by the internal revenue service we would not be entitled to claim the deductions for depreciation and cost recovery generally available to an owner of property furthermore if a saleleaseback transaction were so recharacterized we 

  

 

  

might fail to satisfy the reit asset tests or income tests and consequently could lose our reit status effective with the year of recharacterization see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations — qualification as a reit — asset tests” and “— income tests” alternatively the amount of our reit taxable income could be recalculated which may cause us to fail to meet the reit annual distribution requirements for a taxable year see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations — qualification as a reit — annual distribution requirements” 

  

other risk factors 

  

we are also subject to other risks first our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain antitakeover provisions restrictions on share ownership and transfer and super majority stockholder approval requirements for business combinations that could make it more difficult for or even prevent a third party from acquiring us without the approval of our incumbent board of directors provisions and agreements that inhibit or discourage takeover attempts could reduce the market value of our common stock 

  

additionally we are dependent on key personnel although we have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers losing any one of them could at least temporarily have an adverse impact on our operations we believe that losing more than one could have a material adverse impact on our business

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various market risks including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates we seek to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates by matching the terms of new investments with new longterm fixed rate borrowings to the extent possible we may or may not elect to use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate exposure these decisions are principally based on our policy to match our variable rate investments with comparable borrowings but are also based on the general trend in interest rates at the applicable dates and our perception of the future volatility of interest rates this section is presented to provide a discussion of the risks associated with potential fluctuations in interest rates 

we historically borrow on our unsecured line of credit arrangement to acquire construct or make loans relating to health care and seniors housing properties then as market conditions dictate we will issue equity or longterm fixed rate debt to repay the borrowings under the unsecured line of credit arrangement 

a change in interest rates will not affect the interest expense associated with our fixed rate debt interest rate changes however will affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt changes in the interest rate environment upon maturity of this fixed rate debt could have an effect on our future cash flows and earnings depending on whether the debt is replaced with other fixed rate debt variable rate debt equity or repaid by the sale of assets to illustrate the impact of changes in the interest rate markets we performed a sensitivity analysis on our fixed rate debt instruments whereby we modeled the change in net present values arising from a hypothetical 1 increase in interest rates to determine the instruments’ change in fair value the following table summarizes the analysis performed as of the dates indicated in thousands 

  



  

  as of december 31 2011 we had eight interest rate swaps for a total aggregate notional amount of 135445000 the swaps hedge interest payments associated with longterm libor based borrowings and mature between december 31 2012 and december 31 2013 

  our variable rate debt including our unsecured line of credit arrangements is reflected at fair value at december 31 2011 we had 610000000 outstanding related to our variable rate lines of credit and 415101000 outstanding related to our variable rate secured debt assuming no changes in outstanding balances a 1 increase in interest rates would result in increased annual interest expense of 10251000 at december 31 2010 we had 300000000 outstanding related to our variable rate line of credit and 103645000 outstanding related to our variable rate secured debt assuming no changes in outstanding balances a 1 increase in interest rates would have resulted in increased annual interest expense of 4036000 

  we are subject to risks associated with debt financing including the risk that existing indebtedness may not be refinanced or that the terms of refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of current indebtedness the majority of our borrowings were completed under indentures or contractual agreements that limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur accordingly in the event that we are unable to raise additional equity or borrow money because of these limitations our ability to acquire additional properties may be limited

property types 

 

we invest in senior housing and health care real estate we evaluate our business and make resource allocations on our two business segments — senior housing and care and medical facilities for additional information regarding business segments see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements the following is a summary of our various property types 

 

senior housing and care 

 

our senior housing and care properties include skilled nursing facilities assisted living facilities independent livingcontinuing care retirement communities and combinations thereof we invest in senior housing and care real estate primarily through acquisition and development excluding our operating partnerships see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements properties are primarily leased under triplenet leases and we are not involved in property management our properties include standalone facilities that provide one level of service combination facilities that provide multiple levels of service and communities or campuses that provide a wide range of services 

 

independent living facilities independent living facilities are agerestricted multifamily properties with central dining facilities that provide residents access to meals and other services such as housekeeping linen service transportation and social and recreational activities 

 

continuing care retirement communities continuing care retirement communities include a combination of detached homes an independent living facility an assisted living facility andor a skilled nursing facility on one campus these communities are appealing to residents because there is no need for relocating when health and medical needs change resident payment plans vary but can include entrance fees condominium fees and rental fees many of these communities also charge monthly maintenance fees in exchange for a living unit meals and some health services 

 

early stage senior housing early stage senior housing communities contain primarily forsale singlefamily homes townhomes cluster homes mobile homes andor condominiums with no specialized services these communities are typically restricted or targeted to adults at least 55 years of age or older residents generally lead an independent lifestyle communities may include amenities such as a clubhouse golf course and recreational spaces 

 

assisted living facilities assisted living facilities are state regulated rental properties that provide the same services as independent living facilities but also provide supportive care from trained employees to residents who require assistance with activities of daily living including management of medications bathing dressing toileting ambulating and eating 

 

alzheimer’sdementia care facilities certain assisted living facilities may include state licensed settings that specialize in caring for those afflicted with alzheimer’s disease andor other types of dementia 

 

skilled nursing facilities skilled nursing facilities are licensed daily rate or rental properties where the majority of individuals require 24hour nursing andor medical care generally these properties are licensed for medicaid andor medicare reimbursement 

 

medical facilities 

 

our medical facilities include medical office buildings hospitals and life science buildings our medical office buildings are typically leased to multiple tenants and generally require a certain level of property management our hospital investments are typically structured similar to our senior housing and care investments our life science investments represent investments in an unconsolidated joint venture see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

medical office buildings the medical office building portfolio consists of health care related buildings that include physician offices ambulatory surgery centers diagnostic facilities outpatient services andor labs our portfolio has a strong affiliation with health systems approximately 80 of the buildings are either located on campus or affiliated with hospitals through a satellite location 

hospitals our hospitals generally include acute care hospitals inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and longterm acute care hospitals acute care hospitals provide a wide range of inpatient and outpatient services including but not limited to surgery rehabilitation therapy and clinical laboratories inpatient rehabilitation hospitals provide inpatient services for patients with intensive rehabilitation needs longterm acute care hospitals provide inpatient services for patients with complex medical conditions that require more intensive care monitoring or emergency support than is available in most skilled nursing facilities 

 

investments 

 

we invest in senior housing and health care real estate primarily through acquisitions and developments we diversify our investment portfolio by property type operatortenant and geographic location in determining whether to invest in a property we focus on the following 1 the experience of the obligor’s management team 2 the historical and projected financial and operational performance of the property 3 the credit of the obligor 4 the security for the lease or loan 5 the real estate attributes of the building and its location and 6 the capital committed to the property by the obligor we conduct market research and analysis for all potential investments in addition we review the value of all properties the interest rates and covenant requirements of any facilitylevel debt to be assumed by us at the time of the acquisition and the anticipated sources of repayment of any of the obligor’s existing debt that is not to be assumed by us at the time of the acquisition 

 

we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property our asset management process for senior housing and care properties generally includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each property periodic review of obligor creditworthiness periodic property inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure real estate taxes letters of credit and other collateral our internal property management division actively manages and monitors the medical office building portfolio with a comprehensive process including tenant relations tenant lease expirations the mix of health service providers hospitalhealth system relationships property performance capital improvement needs and market conditions among other things in monitoring our portfolio our personnel use a proprietary database to collect and analyze propertyspecific data additionally we conduct extensive research to ascertain industry trends and risks 

 

through asset management and research we evaluate the operating environment in each property’s market to determine whether payment risk is likely to increase when we identify unacceptable levels of payment risk we seek to mitigate eliminate or transfer the risk we categorize the risk as obligor property or market risk for obligor risk we typically find a substitute operatortenant to run the property for property risk we usually work with the operatortenant to institute propertylevel management changes to address the risk finally for market risk we often encourage an obligor to change its capital structure including refinancing the property or raising additional equity through these asset management and research efforts we are generally able to intervene at an early stage to address payment risk and in so doing support both the collectability of revenue and the value of our investment 

 

depending upon market conditions we believe that new investments will be available in the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to our stockholders 

 

investment types 

 

real property our hospitals and senior housing and care properties are primarily comprised of land building improvements and related rights excluding properties in our senior housing operating partnerships see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements these properties are generally leased to operators under longterm operating leases the leases generally have a fixed contractual term of 12 to 15 years and contain one or more five to 15year renewal options certain of our leases also contain purchase options most of our rents are received under triplenet leases requiring the operator to pay rent and all additional charges incurred in the operation of the leased property the tenants are required to repair rebuild and maintain the leased properties substantially all of these operating leases are designed with either fixed or contingent escalating rent structures leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straightline basis over the initial lease period subject to a collectability assessment rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period 

at december 31 2010 approximately 91 of our hospitals and senior housing and care properties were subject to master leases a master lease is a lease of multiple properties to one tenant entity under a single lease agreement from time to time we may acquire additional properties that are then leased to the tenant under the master lease the tenant is required to make one monthly payment that represents rent on all the properties that are subject to the master lease typically the master lease tenant can exercise its right to purchase the properties or to renew the master lease only with respect to all leased properties at the same time this bundling feature benefits us because the tenant cannot limit the purchase or renewal to the better performing properties and terminate the leasing arrangement with respect to the poorer performing properties this spreads our risk among the entire group of properties within the master lease the bundling feature should provide a similar advantage if the master lease tenant is in bankruptcy subject to certain restrictions a debtor in bankruptcy has the right to assume or reject each of its leases it is our intent that a tenant in bankruptcy would be required to assume or reject the master lease as a whole rather than deciding on a property by property basis 

 

our medical office building portfolio is primarily selfmanaged and consists principally of multitenant properties leased to health care providers our leases have favorable lease terms that typically include fixed increasers and some form of operating expense reimbursement by the tenant as of december 31 2010 88 of our portfolio included leases with full pass through 10 with a partial expense reimbursement modified gross and 2 with no expense reimbursement gross our medical office building leases are noncancellable operating leases that have a weighted average remaining term of 85 years at december 31 2010 and are normally credit enhanced by guaranties andor letters of credit 

 

construction we currently provide for the construction of properties for tenants generally as part of longterm operating leases we capitalize certain interest costs associated with funds used to pay for the construction of properties owned by us the amount capitalized is based upon the amount advanced during the construction period using the rate of interest that approximates our cost of financing our interest expense is reduced by the amount capitalized we also typically charge a transaction fee at the commencement of construction which we defer and amortize to income over the term of the resulting lease the construction period commences upon funding and terminates upon the earlier of the completion of the applicable property or the end of a specified period during the construction period we advance funds to the tenants in accordance with agreed upon terms and conditions which require among other things periodic site visits by a company representative during the construction period we generally require an additional credit enhancement in the form of payment and performance bonds andor completion guaranties at december 31 2010 we had outstanding construction investments of 356793000 and were committed to providing additional funds of approximately 268055000 to complete construction for investment properties 

 

real estate loans our real estate loans are typically structured to provide us with interest income principal amortization and transaction fees and are generally secured by a first second or third mortgage lien leasehold mortgage corporate guaranties andor personal guaranties at december 31 2010 we had outstanding real estate loans of 436580000 the interest yield averaged approximately 91 per annum on our outstanding real estate loan balances our yield on real estate loans depends upon a number of factors including the stated interest rate average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments the real estate loans outstanding at december 31 2010 are generally subject to three to 20year terms with principal amortization schedules andor balloon payments of the outstanding principal balances at the end of the term typically real estate loans are crossdefaulted and crosscollateralized with other real estate loans operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its affiliates 

 

principles of consolidation 

 

the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our whollyowned subsidiaries and joint ventures that we control through voting rights or other means all material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation 

at inception of the joint venture transactions we identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights “variable interest entities” or “vies” and determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of its operations a variable interest entity is broadly defined as an entity where either i the equity investors as a group if any do not have a controlling financial interest or ii the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support we consolidate investments in vies when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary asc 810 requires enterprises to perform a qualitative approach to determining whether or not a vie will need to be consolidated on a continuous basis this evaluation is based on an enterprise’s ability to direct and influence the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact that entity’s economic performance 

 

for investments in joint ventures we evaluate the type of rights held by the limited partners which may preclude consolidation in circumstances in which the sole general partner would otherwise consolidate the limited partnership the assessment of limited partners’ rights and their impact on the presumption of control over a limited partnership by the sole general partner should be made when an investor becomes the sole general partner and should be reassessed if i there is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights of the limited partners ii the sole general partner increases or decreases its ownership in the limited partnership interests or iii there is an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding limited partnership interests we similarly evaluate the rights of managing members of limited liability companies 

 

equity investments 

 

equity investments at december 31 2010 and 2009 include an investment in a public company that has a readily determinable fair market value we classify this equity investment as availableforsale and accordingly record this investment at its fair market value with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income a separate component of stockholders’ equity equity investments at december 31 2010 and 2009 also include an investment in a private company we do not have the ability to exercise influence over the company so the investment is accounted for under the cost method under the cost method of accounting investments in private companies are carried at cost and are adjusted only for otherthantemporary declines in fair value return of capital and additional investments these equity investments represent a minimal ownership interest in these companies additionally equity investments at december 31 2010 include investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 

 

investments in unconsolidated joint ventures investments in less than majority owned entities where our interests represent a general partnership interest but substantive participating rights or substantive kickout rights have been granted to the limited partners or when our interests do not represent the general partnership interest and we do not control the major operating and financial policies of the entity are reported under the equity method of accounting under the equity method of accounting our share of the investee’s earnings or losses is included in our consolidated results of operations the initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is based on the amount paid to purchase the joint venture interest or the estimated fair value of the assets prior to the sale of interests in the joint venture we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the equity method investment to its carrying value when we determine a decline in the estimated fair value of such an investment below its carrying value is otherthantemporary an impairment is recorded 

 

borrowing policies 

 

we utilize a combination of debt and equity to fund investments our debt and equity levels are determined by management to maintain a conservative credit profile generally we intend to issue unsecured fixed rate public debt with longterm maturities to approximate the maturities on our leases and loans for shortterm purposes we may borrow on our unsecured line of credit arrangement we replace these borrowings with longterm capital such as senior unsecured notes common stock or preferred stock when terms are deemed favorable we may invest in properties subject to existing mortgage indebtedness in addition we may obtain secured financing for unleveraged properties in which we have invested or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis in our agreements with our lenders we are subject to restrictions with respect to secured and unsecured indebtedness 

competition 

 

we compete with other real estate investment trusts real estate partnerships private equity and hedge fund investors banks insurance companies financeinvestment companies governmentsponsored agencies taxable and taxexempt bond funds health care operators developers and other investors in the acquisition development leasing and financing of health care and senior housing properties some of our competitors are larger with greater resources and lower costs of capital than us increased competition inhibits our ability to identify and successfully complete investments we compete for investments based on a number of factors including rates financings offered underwriting criteria and reputation our ability to successfully compete is also impacted by economic and population trends availability of acceptable investment opportunities our ability to negotiate beneficial investment terms availability and cost of capital construction and renovation costs and new and existing laws and regulations 

 

the operatorstenants of our properties compete on a local and regional basis with operatorstenants of properties that provide comparable services operatorstenants compete for patients and residents based on a number of factors including quality of care reputation physical appearance of properties services offered family preferences physicians staff and price we also face competition from other health care facilities for tenants such as physicians and other health care providers that provide comparable facilities and services

certain government regulations 

 

health law matters — generally 

 

typically operators of senior housing facilities do not receive significant funding from government programs and are largely subject to state laws as opposed to federal laws operators of skilled nursing facilities and hospitals do receive significant funding from government programs and these facilities are subject to the federal and state laws that regulate the type and quality of the medical andor nursing care provided ancillary services  eg  respiratory occupational physical and infusion therapies qualifications of the administrative personnel and nursing staff the adequacy of the physical plant and equipment reimbursement and rate setting and operating 

policies in addition as described below operators of these facilities are subject to extensive laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including but not limited to the federal antikickback statute the federal stark law and the federal false claims act as well as comparable state law counterparts hospitals physician group practice clinics and other health care providers that operate in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal state and local licensure registration certification and inspection laws regulations and industry standards our tenants’ failure to comply with any of these and other laws could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension decertification or exclusion from federal and state health care programs loss of license or closure of the facility 

 

licensing and certification 

 

the primary regulations that affect senior housing facilities with assisted living are state licensing and registration laws in granting and renewing these licenses the state regulatory agencies consider numerous factors relating to a property’s physical plant and operations including but not limited to admission and discharge standards staffing and training a decision to grant or renew a license is also affected by a property owner’s record with respect to patient and consumer rights medication guidelines and rules certain of the senior housing facilities mortgaged to or owned by us may require the resident to pay an entrance or upfront fee a portion of which may be refundable these entrance fee communities are subject to significant state regulatory oversight including for example oversight of each facility’s financial condition establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial restrictions the right of residents to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time lien rights in favor of residents restrictions on change of ownership and similar matters such oversight and the rights of residents within these entrance fee communities may have an effect on the revenue or operations of the operators of such facilities and therefore may adversely affect us 

 

certain health care facilities are subject to a variety of licensure and certificate of need “con” laws and regulations where applicable con laws generally require among other requirements that a facility demonstrate the need for 1 constructing a new facility 2 adding beds or expanding an existing facility 3 investing in major capital equipment or adding new services 4 changing the ownership or control of an existing licensed facility or 5 terminating services that have been previously approved through the con process certain state con laws and regulations may restrict the ability of operators to add new properties or expand an existing facility’s size or services in addition con laws may constrain the ability of an operator to transfer responsibility for operating a particular facility to a new operator if we have to replace a property operator who is excluded from participating in a federal or state health care program as discussed below our ability to replace the operator may be affected by a particular state’s con laws regulations and applicable guidance governing changes in provider control 

 

with respect to licensure generally our skilled nursing facilities and acute care facilities are required to be licensed and certified for participation in medicare medicaid and other federal health care programs this generally requires license renewals and compliance surveys on an annual or biannual basis the failure of our operators to maintain or renew any required license or regulatory approval as well as the failure of our operators to correct serious deficiencies identified in a compliance survey could require those operators to discontinue operations at a property in addition if a property is found to be out of compliance with the medicare medicaid or other health care program conditions of participation in the property operator may be excluded from participating in those government health care programs any such occurrence may impair an operators’ ability to meet their financial obligations to us if we have to replace an excluded property operator our ability to replace the operator may be affected by federal and state laws regulations and applicable guidance governing changes in provider control this may result in payment delays an inability to find a replacement operator a significant working capital commitment from us to a new operator or other difficulties 

 

reimbursement 

 

senior housing facilities approximately 37 of our rental revenues for the year ended december 31 2010 were attributable to senior housing facilities the majority of the revenues received by the operators of our senior housing facilities are from private pay sources the remaining revenue source is primarily medicaid under certain waiver programs as a part of the omnibus budget reconciliation act “obra” of 1981 congress established a waiver program enabling some states to offer medicaid reimbursement to assisted living providers as an alternative 

to institutional longterm care services the provisions of obra and the subsequent obra acts of 1987 and 1990 permit states to seek a waiver from typical medicaid requirements to develop costeffective alternatives to longterm care including medicaid payments for assisted living and home health as of december 31 2010 four of our 41 senior housing operators received medicaid reimbursement pursuant to medicaid waiver programs for the twelve months ended september 30 2010 approximately 9 of the revenues at our senior housing facilities were from medicaid reimbursement there can be no guarantee that a state medicaid program operating pursuant to a waiver will be able to maintain its waiver status 

 

rates paid by selfpay residents are set by the facilities and are determined by local market conditions and operating costs generally facilities receive a higher payment per day for a private pay resident than for a medicaid beneficiary who requires a comparable level of care the level of medicaid reimbursement varies from state to state thus the revenues generated by operators of our assisted living facilities may be adversely affected by payor mix acuity level changes in medicaid eligibility and reimbursement levels in addition a state could lose its medicaid waiver and no longer be permitted to utilize medicaid dollars to reimburse for assisted living services changes in revenues could in turn have a material adverse effect on an operator’s ability to meet its obligations to us 

 

skilled nursing facilities and hospitals skilled nursing facilities and hospitals typically receive most of their revenues from the medicare and medicaid programs with the balance representing reimbursement payments from private payors including private insurers consequently changes in federal or state reimbursement policies may also adversely affect an operator’s ability to cover its expenses including our rent or debt service skilled nursing facilities and hospitals are subject to periodic pre and postpayment reviews and other audits by federal and state authorities a review or audit of a property operator’s claims could result in recoupments denials or delay of payments in the future which could have a material adverse effect on the operator’s ability to meet its financial obligations to us due to the significant judgments and estimates inherent in payor settlement accounting no assurance can be given as to the adequacy of any reserves maintained by our property operators to cover potential adjustments to reimbursements or to cover settlements made to payors in fact in december 2010 the department of health and human services office of inspector general “oig” released a report focusing on skilled nursing facilities’ billing practices for medicare part a payments and found that between 20062008 skilled nursing facilities increasingly billed for higher paying resource utilization groups “rugs” the payment classification mechanism for the medicare program even though beneficiary characteristics remained largely unchanged in particular from 2006 to 2008 oig found that the percentage of rugs for ultra high therapy increased from 17 to 28 despite the fact that beneficiaries’ ages and diagnoses at admission were largely unchanged during that time period as a result of the recent attention on skilled nursing billing practices and ongoing government pressure to reduce spending by government health care programs government health care programs may limit or reduce payments to skilled nursing facilities and hospitals and as a result an operator’s ability to meet its financial obligations to us may be significantly impaired 

 

medicare reimbursement and skilled nursing facilities for the twelve months ended september 30 2010 approximately 30 of the revenues at our skilled nursing facilities which comprised 27 of our rental revenues for the year ended december 31 2010 were paid by medicare skilled nursing facilities are reimbursed under the medicare skilled nursing facility prospective payment system “snf pps” there is a risk that some skilled nursing facilities’ costs will exceed the fixed payments under the snf pps and there is also a risk that payments under the snf pps may be set below the costs to provide certain items and services which could result in immediate financial difficulties for skilled nursing facilities and could cause operators to seek bankruptcy protection skilled nursing facilities have faced these types of difficulties since the implementation of the snf pps 

 

skilled nursing facilities received a net 11 medicare payment rate decrease for federal fiscal year 2010 this 11 net decrease is the result of a 33 decrease in payments due to recalibration of the casemix indexes combined with a 22 increase in payments through “market basket” changes for fiscal year 2010 the centers for medicare  medicaid services “cms” an agency of the us department of health and human services “hhs” has announced its intention to make a positive payment update for skilled nursing facilities for fiscal year 2011 — a net 17 increase resulting from a 23 market basket update less a 06 forecasting error adjustment section 5008 of the deficit reduction act of 2005 directs the secretary of hhs to conduct a demonstration program for a three year period beginning january 1 2008 assessing the costs and outcomes of patients discharged from hospitals in a variety of postacute care settings including skilled nursing facilities the outcome of that 

demonstration program could lead to changes in medicare coverage and reimbursement for postacute care because the results of the demonstration have not yet been finalized we cannot predict the potential financial implications those results or any other proposed changes to the medicare program may have on our operators or tenants 

 

the balanced budget act of 1997 mandated caps on medicare reimbursement for certain therapy services however congress imposed various moratoriums on the implementation of those caps for 2011 the annual payment cap of 1870 per patient applies to occupational therapy and a separate 1870 cap applies to speech and physical therapy congress has permitted patients exceeding the cap to obtain additional medicare coverage through a waiver program if the therapy is deemed medically necessary the waiver program was historically extended most recently on december 15 2010 by the medicare and medicaid extenders act hr 4994 which extended the waiver program through december 31 2011 prior to the recent legislation the program was scheduled to expire december 31 2010 if the exception expires patients will need to use private funds to pay for the cost of therapy above the caps if patients are unable to satisfy their outofpocket cost responsibility to reimburse an operator for services rendered the operator’s ability to meet its financial obligations to us could be adversely impacted 

 

medicare reimbursement and hospitals for the twelve months ended september 30 2010 approximately 56 of the revenues at our hospitals which comprised 8 of our rental revenues for the year ended december 31 2010 were from medicare reimbursements hospitals generally are reimbursed by medicare under the hospital inpatient prospective payment system “pps” the hospital outpatient prospective payment system “opps” the long term care hospital prospective payment system “ltch pps” or the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system “irf pps” acute care hospitals provide a wide range of inpatient and outpatient services including but not limited to surgery rehabilitation therapy and clinical laboratory services longterm acute care hospitals provide inpatient services for patients with medical conditions that are often complex and that require more intensive care monitoring or emergency support than that available in most skilled nursing facilities inpatient rehabilitation facilities provide intensive rehabilitation services in an inpatient setting for patients requiring at least three hours of rehabilitation services a day 

 

with respect to medicare’s pps for regular hospitals reimbursement for inpatient services is made on the basis of a fixed prospective rate based on the principal diagnosis of the patient hospitals may be at risk to the extent that their costs in treating a specific case exceed the fixed payment amount the diagnosis related group “drg” reimbursement system was updated in 2008 to expand the number of drgs from 538 to 745 in order to better distinguish more severe conditions one additional drg was added in 2009 for a new total of 746 in some cases a hospital might be able to qualify for an outlier payment if the hospital’s losses exceed a threshold 

 

medicaid reimbursement medicaid is a major payor source for residents in our skilled nursing facilities and hospitals for the twelve months ended september 30 2010 approximately 51 of the revenues of our skilled nursing facilities and 4 of the revenues of our hospitals were attributable to medicaid reimbursement payments the federal and state governments share responsibility for financing medicaid the federal matching rate known as the federal medical assistance percentage “fmap” varies by state based on relative per capita income but is at least 50 in all states on average medicaid is the largest component of total state spending representing approximately 21 of total state spending the percentage of medicaid dollars used for longterm care varies from state to state due in part to different ratios of elderly population and eligibility requirements within certain federal guidelines states have a fairly wide range of discretion to determine eligibility and reimbursement methodology many states reimburse longterm care facilities using fixed daily rates which are applied prospectively based on patient acuity and the historical costs incurred in providing patient care reasonable costs typically include allowances for staffing administrative and general expenses property and equipment  eg  real estate taxes depreciation and fair rental 

 

in most states medicaid does not fully reimburse the cost of providing skilled nursing services certain states are attempting to slow the rate of growth in medicaid expenditures by freezing rates or restricting eligibility and benefits as of the beginning of state fiscal year 2011 states in which we have skilled nursing property investments held rates flat on average for the year our skilled nursing portfolio’s average medicaid rate will likely vary throughout the year as states continue to make interim changes to their budgets and medicaid funding in addition medicaid reimbursement rates may decline if revenues in a particular state are not sufficient to fund budgeted expenditures president obama’s proposed fiscal year budget for 2012 released on february 14 2011 has the 

potential to further impact medicaid reimbursement rates the president’s budget includes a proposal to phase down the medicaid provider tax a tax paid by health care providers to help fund state medicaid programs beginning with a reduction of 45 in fiscal year 2015 if the president’s proposal is implemented the various state medicaid programs will receive less funds which could adversely affect our operators and tenants 

 

the medicare part d drug benefit became effective january 1 2006 since that date lowincome medicare beneficiaries eligible for both medicare and full medicaid benefits including those nursing home residents who are dually eligible for both programs may enroll and receive outpatient prescription drugs under medicare not medicaid medicare part d has resulted in increased administrative responsibilities for nursing home operators because enrollment in medicare part d is voluntary and residents must choose between multiple prescription drug plans operators may also experience increased expenses to the extent that a particular drug prescribed to a patient is not listed on the medicare part d drug plan formulary for the plan in which the patient is enrolled 

 

the reimbursement methodologies applied to health care facilities continue to evolve federal and state authorities have considered and may seek to implement new or modified reimbursement methodologies that may negatively impact health care property operations the impact of any such changes if implemented may result in a material adverse effect on our skilled nursing and hospital property operations no assurance can be given that current revenue sources or levels will be maintained accordingly there can be no assurance that payments under a government health care program are currently or will be in the future sufficient to fully reimburse the property operators for their operating and capital expenses as a result an operator’s ability to meet its financial obligations to us could be adversely impacted 

 

finally the patient protection and affordable care act “ppaca” and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 which amends the ppaca collectively the “health reform laws” further discussed belowmay have a significant impact on medicare medicaid other federal health care programs and private insurers which impact the reimbursement amounts received by skilled nursing facilities and other health care providers the health reform laws could have a substantial and material adverse effect on all parties directly or indirectly involved in the health care system 

 

other related laws 

 

skilled nursing facilities and hospitals and senior housing facilities that receive medicaid payments are subject to federal state and local laws regulations and applicable guidance that govern the operations and financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by health care providers certain of these laws prohibit direct or indirect payments of any kind for the purpose of inducing or encouraging the referral of patients for medical products or services reimbursable by government health care programs other laws require providers to furnish only medically necessary services and submit to the government valid and accurate statements for each service still other laws require providers to comply with a variety of safety health and other requirements relating to the condition of the licensed property and the quality of care provided sanctions for violations of these laws regulations and other applicable guidance may include but are not limited to criminal andor civil penalties and fines loss of licensure immediate termination of government payments and exclusion from any government health care program in certain circumstances violation of these rules such as those prohibiting abusive and fraudulent behavior with respect to one property may subject other facilities under common control or ownership to sanctions including exclusion from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs as well as other government health care programs in the ordinary course of its business a property operator is regularly subjected to inquiries investigations and audits by the federal and state agencies that oversee these laws and regulations 

 

all health care providers including but not limited to skilled nursing facilities and hospitals and senior housing facilities that receives medicaid payments are also subject to the federal antikickback statute which generally prohibits persons from offering providing soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing of a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal health care program such as medicare or medicaid skilled nursing facilities and hospitals are also subject to the federal ethics in patient referral act of 1989 commonly referred to as the stark law the stark law generally prohibits the submission of claims to medicare for payment if the claim results from a physician referral for certain designated services and the physician has a financial relationship with the health service provider that does not 

qualify under one of the exceptions for a financial relationship under the stark law similar prohibitions on physician selfreferrals and submission of claims apply to state medicaid programs further health care providers including but not limited to skilled nursing facilities and hospitals and senior housing facilities that receive medicaid payments are subject to substantial financial penalties under the civil monetary penalties act and the federal false claims act and in particular actions under the federal false claims act’s “whistleblower” provisions private enforcement of health care fraud has increased due in large part to amendments to the federal false claims act that encourage private individuals to sue on behalf of the government these whistleblower suits brought by private individuals known as qui tam actions may be filed by almost anyone including present and former patients nurses and other employees such whistleblower actions have been brought against nursing facilities on the basis of the alleged failure of the nursing facility to meet applicable regulations relating to its operations significantly if a claim is successfully adjudicated the federal false claims act provides for treble damages up to 11000 per claim 

 

prosecutions investigations or whistleblower actions could have a material adverse effect on a property operator’s liquidity financial condition and operations which could adversely affect the ability of the operator to meet its financial obligations to us finally various state false claim act and antikickback laws may also apply to each property operator violation of any of the foregoing statutes can result in criminal andor civil penalties that could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its financial obligations to us 

 

other legislative developments over the past several years including the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” have greatly expanded the definition of health care fraud and related offenses and broadened its scope to include private health care plans in addition to government payors congress also has greatly increased funding for the department of justice federal bureau of investigation and the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services to audit investigate and prosecute suspected health care fraud moreover a significant portion of the billions in health care fraud recoveries over the past several years has also been returned to government agencies to further fund their fraud investigation and prosecution efforts 

 

additionally other hipaa provisions and regulations provide for communication of health information through standard electronic transaction formats and for the privacy and security of health information in order to comply with the regulations health care providers often must undertake significant operational and technical implementation efforts operators also may face significant financial exposure if they fail to maintain the privacy and security of medical records and other personal health information about individuals the health information technology for economic and clinical health “hitech” act passed in february 2009 strengthened the hhs secretary’s authority to impose civil money penalties for hipaa violations occurring after february 18 2009 hitech directs the hhs secretary to provide for periodic audits to ensure covered entities and their business associates as that term is defined under hipaa comply with the applicable hitech requirements increasing the likelihood that a hipaa violation will result in an enforcement action cms issued an interim final rule which conformed hipaa enforcement regulations to the hitech act increasing the maximum penalty for multiple violations of a single requirement or prohibition to 15 million higher penalties may accrue for violations of multiple requirements or prohibitions hipaa violations are also potentially subject to criminal penalties 

 

in november 2002 cms began an ongoing national nursing home quality initiative nhqi under this initiative historical survey information the nhqi pilot evaluation report and the nhqi overview is made available to the public online the nhqi website provides consumer and provider information regarding the quality of care in nursing homes the data allows consumers providers states and researchers to compare quality information that shows how well nursing homes are caring for their residents’ physical and clinical needs the posted nursing home quality measures come from resident assessment data that nursing homes routinely collect on the residents at specified intervals during their stay if the operators of nursing facilities are unable to achieve quality of care ratings that are comparable or superior to those of their competitors they may lose market share to other facilities reducing their revenues and adversely impacting their ability to make rental payments 

 

finally government investigations and enforcement actions brought against the health care industry have increased dramatically over the past several years and are expected to continue some of these enforcement actions represent novel legal theories and expansions in the application of the federal false claims act the costs for an operator of a health care property associated with both defending such enforcement actions and the undertakings in 

settling these actions can be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its obligations to us

general 

 

we elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust a “reit” commencing with our first taxable year we intend to continue to operate in such a manner as to qualify as a reit but there is no guarantee that we will qualify or remain qualified as a reit for subsequent years qualification and taxation as a reit depends upon our ability to meet a variety of qualification tests imposed under federal income tax law with respect to income assets distribution level and diversity of share ownership as discussed below under “— qualification as a reit” there can be no assurance that we will be owned and organized and will operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified 

 

in any year in which we qualify as a reit in general we will not be subject to federal income tax on that portion of our reit taxable income or capital gain that is distributed to stockholders we may however be subject to tax at normal corporate rates on any taxable income or capital gain not distributed if we elect to retain and pay income tax on our net longterm capital gain stockholders are required to include their proportionate share of our undistributed longterm capital gain in income but they will receive a refundable credit for their share of any taxes paid by us on such gain 

 

despite the reit election we may be subject to federal income and excise tax as follows 

 

 14 

 

  

if we acquire any assets from a corporation which is or has been a “c” corporation in a carryover basis transaction we could be liable for specified liabilities that are inherited from the “c” corporation a “c” corporation is generally defined as a corporation that is required to pay full corporate level federal income tax if we recognize gain on the disposition of the assets during the tenyear period beginning on the date on which the assets were acquired by us then to the extent of the assets’ “builtin gain” ie the excess of the fair market value of the asset over the adjusted tax basis in the asset in each case determined as of the beginning of the tenyear period we will be subject to tax on the gain at the highest regular corporate rate applicable the results described in this paragraph with respect to the recognition of builtin gain assume that the builtin gain assets at the time the builtin gain assets were subject to a conversion transaction either where a “c” corporation elected reit status or a reit acquired the assets from a “c” corporation were not treated as sold to an unrelated party and gain recognized effective december 30 2010 we acquired 19 assets that are subject to builtin gains tax until december 2020 see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the builtin gains tax 

 

qualification as a reit 

 

a reit is defined as a corporation trust or association 

 

  

conditions 1 to 4 inclusive must be met during the entire taxable year and condition 5 must be met during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months for purposes of conditions 5 and 6 pension funds and certain other taxexempt entities are treated as individuals subject to a “lookthrough” exception in the case of condition 6 

based on publicly available information we believe we have satisfied the share ownership requirements set forth in 5 and 6 above in addition article vi of our amended and restated bylaws provides for restrictions regarding ownership and transfer of shares these restrictions are intended to assist us in continuing to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in 5 and 6 above these restrictions however may not ensure that we will in all cases be able to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in 5 and 6 above 

 

we have complied with and will continue to comply with regulatory rules to send annual letters to certain of our stockholders requesting information regarding the actual ownership of our stock if despite sending the annual letters we do not know or after exercising reasonable diligence would not have known whether we failed to meet the five or fewer requirement we will be treated as having met the five or fewer requirement if we fail to comply with these regulatory rules we will be subject to a monetary penalty if our failure to comply was due to intentional disregard of the requirement the penalty would be increased however if our failure to comply were due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect no penalty would be imposed 

 

we may own a number of properties through wholly owned subsidiaries a corporation will qualify as a “qualified reit subsidiary” if 100 of its stock is owned by a reit and the reit does not elect to treat the subsidiary as a taxable reit subsidiary a “qualified reit subsidiary” will not be treated as a separate corporation and all assets liabilities and items of income deductions and credits of a “qualified reit subsidiary” will be treated as assets liabilities and items as the case may be of the reit a “qualified reit subsidiary” is not subject to federal income tax and our ownership of the voting stock of a qualified reit subsidiary will not violate the restrictions against ownership of securities of any one issuer which constitute more than 10 of the value or total voting power of such issuer or more than 5 of the value of our total assets as described below under “— asset tests” 

 

if we invest in a partnership a limited liability company or a trust taxed as a partnership or as a disregarded entity we will be deemed to own a proportionate share of the partnership’s limited liability company’s or trust’s assets likewise we will be treated as receiving our share of the income and loss of the partnership limited liability company or trust and the gross income will retain the same character in our hands as it has in the hands of the partnership limited liability company or trust these “lookthrough” rules apply for purposes of the income tests and assets tests described below 

 

income tests there are two separate percentage tests relating to our sources of gross income that we must satisfy for each taxable year 

 

  

for taxable years beginning on or before october 22 2004 1 payments to us under an interest rate swap or cap agreement option futures contract forward rate agreement or any similar financial instrument entered into by us to reduce interest rate risk on indebtedness incurred or to be incurred and 2 gain from the sale or other disposition of any such investment are treated as income qualifying under the 95 gross income test as to transactions entered into in taxable years beginning after october 22 2004 any of our income from a “clearly identified” hedging transaction that is entered into by us in the normal course of business directly or indirectly to manage the risk of interest rate movements price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings or obligations incurred or to be incurred by us or such other risks that are prescribed by the internal revenue service is excluded from the 95 gross income test 

 

for transactions entered into after july 30 2008 any of our income from a “clearly identified” hedging transaction that is entered into by us in the normal course of business directly or indirectly to manage the risk of interest rate movements price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings or obligations incurred or to be incurred by us is excluded from the 95 and 75 gross income tests 

for transactions entered into after july 30 2008 any of our income from a “clearly identified” hedging transaction entered into by us primarily to manage risk of currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain that is included in gross income in the 95 and 75 gross income tests is excluded from the 95 and 75 gross income tests 

 

in general a hedging transaction is “clearly identified” if 1 the transaction is identified as a hedging transaction before the end of the day on which it is entered into and 2 the items or risks being hedged are identified “substantially contemporaneously” with the hedging transaction an identification is not substantially contemporaneous if it is made more than 35 days after entering into the hedging transaction 

 

as to gains and items of income recognized after july 30 2008 “passive foreign exchange gain” for any taxable year will not constitute gross income for purposes of the 95 gross income test and “real estate foreign exchange gain” for any taxable year will not constitute gross income for purposes of the 75 gross income test real estate foreign exchange gain is foreign currency gain as defined in internal revenue code section 988b1 which is attributable to i any qualifying item of income or gain for purposes of the 75 gross income test ii the acquisition or ownership of obligations secured by mortgages on real property or interests in real property or iii becoming or being the obligor under obligations secured by mortgages on real property or on interests in real property real estate foreign exchange gain also includes internal revenue code section 987 gain attributable to a qualified business unit a “qbu” of a reit if the qbu itself meets the 75 income test for the taxable year and the 75 asset test at the close of each quarter that the reit has directly or indirectly held the qbu real estate foreign exchange gain also includes any other foreign currency gain as determined by the secretary of the treasury passive foreign exchange gain includes all real estate foreign exchange gain and foreign currency gain which is attributable to i any qualifying item of income or gain for purposes of the 95 gross income test ii the acquisition or ownership of obligations iii becoming or being the obligor under obligations and iv any other foreign currency gain as determined by the secretary of the treasury 

 

generally other than income from “clearly identified” hedging transactions entered into by us in the normal course of business any foreign currency gain derived by us from dealing or engaging in substantial and regular trading in securities will constitute gross income which does not qualify under the 95 or 75 gross income tests 

 

rents received by us will qualify as “rents from real property” for purposes of satisfying the gross income tests for a reit only if several conditions are met 

 

 17 

  

for taxable years beginning after august 5 1997 a reit has been permitted to render a de minimis amount of impermissible services to tenants and still treat amounts received with respect to that property as rent from real property the amount received or accrued by the reit during the taxable year for the impermissible services with respect to a property may not exceed 1 of all amounts received or accrued by the reit directly or indirectly from the property the amount received for any service or management operation for this purpose shall be deemed to be not less than 150 of the direct cost of the reit in furnishing or rendering the service or providing the management or operation furthermore impermissible services may be furnished to tenants by a taxable reit subsidiary subject to certain conditions and we may still treat rents received with respect to the property as rent from real property 

 

the term “interest” generally does not include any amount if the determination of the amount depends in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person although an amount generally will not be excluded from the term “interest” solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage of receipts or sales 

 

if we fail to satisfy one or both of the 75 or 95 gross income tests for any taxable year we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for such year if we are eligible for relief for taxable years beginning on or before october 22 2004 these relief provisions generally will be available if 1 our failure to meet such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect 2 we attach a schedule of the sources of our income to our return and 3 any incorrect information on the schedule was not due to fraud with intent to evade tax for taxable years beginning after october 22 2004 these relief provisions generally will be available if 1 following our identification of the failure we file a schedule for such taxable year describing each item of our gross income and 2 the failure to meet such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect 

 

it is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions if these relief provisions apply a 100 tax is imposed on an amount equal to a the gross income attributable to 1 75 of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75 income test and 2 95 of our gross income 90 of our gross income for taxable years beginning on or before october 22 2004 over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 95 income test multiplied by b a fraction intended to reflect our profitability 

 

the secretary of the treasury is given broad authority to determine whether particular items of income or gain qualify or not under the 75 and 95 gross income tests or are to be excluded from the measure of gross income for such purposes 

 

asset tests within 30 days after the close of each quarter of our taxable year we must also satisfy several tests relating to the nature and diversification of our assets determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles at least 75 of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets cash cash items including receivables arising in the ordinary course of our operation government securities and qualified temporary investments although the remaining 25 of our assets generally may be invested without restriction we are prohibited from owning securities representing more than 10 of either the vote the “10 vote test” or value the “10 value test” of the outstanding securities of any issuer other than a qualified reit subsidiary another reit or a taxable reit subsidiary further no more than 25 of the total assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries the “25 asset test” and no more than 5 of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities of any nongovernmental issuer other than a qualified reit subsidiary the “5 asset test” another reit or a taxable reit subsidiary each of the 10 vote test the 10 value test and the 25 and 5 asset tests must be satisfied at the end of each quarter there are special rules which provide relief if the value related tests are not satisfied due to changes in the value of the assets of a reit 

 

for taxable years beginning after december 31 2000 certain items are excluded from the 10 value test including 1 straight debt securities of an issuer including straight debt that provides certain contingent 

payments 2 any loan to an individual or an estate 3 any rental agreement described in section 467 of the internal revenue code other than with a “related person” 4 any obligation to pay rents from real property 5 certain securities issued by a state or any subdivision thereof the district of columbia a foreign government or any political subdivision thereof or the commonwealth of puerto rico 6 any security issued by a reit and 7 any other arrangement that as determined by the secretary of the treasury is excepted from the definition of security “excluded securities” special rules apply to straight debt securities issued by corporations and entities taxable as partnerships for federal income tax purposes if a reit or its taxable reit subsidiary holds 1 straight debt securities of a corporate or partnership issuer and 2 securities of such issuer that are not excluded securities and have an aggregate value greater than 1 of such issuer’s outstanding securities the straight debt securities will be included in the 10 value test 

 

for taxable years beginning after december 31 2000 a reit’s interest as a partner in a partnership is not treated as a security for purposes of applying the 10 value test to securities issued by the partnership further any debt instrument issued by a partnership will not be a security for purposes of applying the 10 value test 1 to the extent of the reit’s interest as a partner in the partnership and 2 if at least 75 of the partnership’s gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions would qualify for the 75 gross income test for taxable years beginning after october 22 2004 for purposes of the 10 value test a reit’s interest in a partnership’s assets is determined by the reit’s proportionate interest in any securities issued by the partnership other than the excluded securities described in the preceding paragraph 

 

for taxable years beginning after july 30 2008 if the reit or its qbu uses a foreign currency as its functional currency the term “cash” includes such foreign currency but only to the extent such foreign currency is i held for use in the normal course of the activities of the reit or qbu which give rise to items of income or gain that are included in the 95 and 75 gross income tests or are directly related to acquiring or holding assets qualifying under the 75 asset test and ii not held in connection with dealing or engaging in substantial and regular trading in securities 

 

with respect to corrections of failures for which the requirements for corrections are satisfied after october 22 2004 regardless of whether such failures occurred in taxable years beginning on before or after such date as to violations of the 10 vote test the 10 value test or the 5 asset test a reit may avoid disqualification as a reit by disposing of sufficient assets to cure a violation that does not exceed the lesser of 1 of the reit’s assets at the end of the relevant quarter or 10000000 provided that the disposition occurs within six months following the last day of the quarter in which the reit first identified the assets for violations of any of the reit asset tests due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that exceed the thresholds described in the preceding sentence a reit can avoid disqualification as a reit after the close of a taxable quarter by taking certain steps including disposition of sufficient assets within the six month period described above to meet the applicable asset test paying a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets during the period of time that the assets were held as nonqualifying assets and filing a schedule with the internal revenue service that describes the nonqualifying assets 

 

investments in taxable reit subsidiaries for taxable years beginning after december 31 2000 reits may own more than 10 of the voting power and value of securities in taxable reit subsidiaries we and any taxable corporate entity in which we own an interest are allowed to jointly elect to treat such entity as a “taxable reit subsidiary” 

 

certain of our subsidiaries have elected to be treated as a taxable reit subsidiary taxable reit subsidiaries are subject to full corporate level federal taxation on their earnings but are permitted to engage in certain types of activities that cannot be performed directly by reits without jeopardizing their reit status our taxable reit subsidiaries will attempt to minimize the amount of these taxes but there can be no assurance whether or the extent to which measures taken to minimize taxes will be successful to the extent our taxable reit subsidiaries are required to pay federal state or local taxes the cash available for distribution as dividends to us from our taxable reit subsidiaries will be reduced 

 

the amount of interest on relatedparty debt that a taxable reit subsidiary may deduct is limited further a 100 tax applies to any interest payments by a taxable reit subsidiary to its affiliated reit to the extent the 

interest rate is not commercially reasonable a taxable reit subsidiary is permitted to deduct interest payments to unrelated parties without any of these restrictions 

 

the internal revenue service may reallocate costs between a reit and its taxable reit subsidiary where there is a lack of arm’slength dealing between the parties any deductible expenses allocated away from a taxable reit subsidiary would increase its tax liability further any amount by which a reit understates its deductions and overstates those of its taxable reit subsidiary will subject to certain exceptions be subject to a 100 tax additional taxable reit subsidiary elections may be made in the future for additional entities in which we own an interest 

 

annual distribution requirements in order to avoid being taxed as a regular corporation we are required to make distributions other than capital gain distributions to our stockholders which qualify for the dividends paid deduction in an amount at least equal to 1 the sum of i 90 of our “reit taxable income” computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain and ii 90 of the aftertax net income if any from foreclosure property minus 2 a portion of certain items of noncash income these distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for that year and if paid on or before the first regular distribution payment after such declaration the amount distributed must not be preferential this means that every stockholder of the class of stock to which a distribution is made must be treated the same as every other stockholder of that class and no class of stock may be treated otherwise than in accordance with its dividend rights as a class to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our “reit taxable income” as adjusted we will be subject to tax on the undistributed amount at regular corporate tax rates finally as discussed above we may be subject to an excise tax if we fail to meet certain other distribution requirements we intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy these annual distribution requirements 

 

it is possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90 distribution requirement or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation due to among other things 1 timing differences between i the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses and ii the inclusion of income and deduction of expenses in arriving at our taxable income or 2 the payment of severance benefits that may not be deductible to us in the event that timing differences occur we may find it necessary to arrange for borrowings or if possible pay dividends in the form of taxable stock dividends in order to meet the distribution requirement 

 

under certain circumstances in the event of a deficiency determined by the internal revenue service we may be able to rectify a resulting failure to meet the distribution requirement for a year by paying “deficiency dividends” to stockholders in a later year which may be included in our deduction for distributions paid for the earlier year thus we may be able to avoid being taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends however we will be required to pay applicable penalties and interest based upon the amount of any deduction taken for deficiency dividend distributions 

 

the internal revenue service issued revenue procedure 200868 which provided temporary relief to publicly traded reits seeking to preserve liquidity by electing cashstock dividends under revenue procedure 200868 a reit may treat the entire dividend including the stock portion as a taxable dividend distribution thereby qualifying for the dividendspaid deduction provided certain requirements are satisfied the cash portion of the dividend may be as low as 10 revenue procedure 200868 as amplified by revenue procedure 201012 applies to dividends declared on or before december 31 2012 and with respect to a taxable year ending on or before december 31 2011 

 

failure to qualify as a reit 

 

if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates distributions to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify as a reit will not be deductible nor will any particular amount of distributions be required to be made in any year all distributions to stockholders will be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these distributions and subject to certain limitations will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporate stockholders unless entitled 

to relief under specific statutory provisions we also will be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to statutory relief failure to qualify for even one year could result in our need to incur indebtedness or liquidate investments in order to pay potentially significant resulting tax liabilities 

 

in addition to the relief described above under “— income tests” and “— asset tests” relief is available in the event that we violate a provision of the internal revenue code that would result in our failure to qualify as a reit if 1 the violation is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect 2 we pay a penalty of 50000 for each failure to satisfy the provision and 3 the violation does not include a violation described under “— income tests” or “— asset tests” above it is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions 

 

federal income taxation of holders of our stock 

 

treatment of taxable us stockholders the following summary applies to you only if you are a “us stockholder” a “us stockholder” is a holder of shares of stock who for united states federal income tax purposes is 

 

  

so long as we qualify for taxation as a reit distributions on shares of our stock made out of the current or accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these distributions and not designated as capital gain dividends will be includable as ordinary income for federal income tax purposes none of these distributions will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for us corporate stockholders 

 

generally for taxable years ending after may 6 2003 through december 31 2012 the maximum marginal rate of tax payable by individuals on dividends received from corporations that are subject to a corporate level of tax is 15 except in limited circumstances this tax rate will not apply to dividends paid to you by us on our shares because generally we are not subject to federal income tax on the portion of our reit taxable income or capital gains distributed to our stockholders the reduced maximum federal income tax rate will apply to that portion if any of dividends received by you with respect to our shares that are attributable to 1 dividends received by us from nonreit corporations or other taxable reit subsidiaries 2 income from the prior year with respect to which we were required to pay federal corporate income tax during the prior year if for example we did not distribute 100 of our reit taxable income for the prior year or 3 the amount of any earnings and profits that were distributed by us and accumulated in a nonreit year 

 

distributions that are designated as capital gain dividends will be taxed as longterm capital gains to the extent they do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year without regard to the period for which you held our stock however if you are a corporation you may be required to treat a portion of some capital gain dividends as ordinary income 

 

if we elect to retain and pay income tax on any net longterm capital gain you would include in income as longterm capital gain your proportionate share of this net longterm capital gain you would also receive a refundable tax credit for your proportionate share of the tax paid by us on such retained capital gains and you would have an increase in the basis of your shares of our stock in an amount equal to your includable capital gains less your share of the tax deemed paid 

you may not include in your federal income tax return any of our net operating losses or capital losses federal income tax rules may also require that certain minimum tax adjustments and preferences be apportioned to you in addition any distribution declared by us in october november or december of any year on a specified date in any such month shall be treated as both paid by us and received by you on december 31 of that year provided that the distribution is actually paid by us no later than january 31 of the following year 

 

we will be treated as having sufficient earnings and profits to treat as a dividend any distribution up to the amount required to be distributed in order to avoid imposition of the 4 excise tax discussed under “— general” and “— qualification as a reit — annual distribution requirements” above as a result you may be required to treat as taxable dividends certain distributions that would otherwise result in a taxfree return of capital moreover any “deficiency dividend” will be treated as a dividend an ordinary dividend or a capital gain dividend as the case may be regardless of our earnings and profits any other distributions in excess of current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to you to the extent these distributions do not exceed the adjusted tax basis of your shares of our stock you will be required to reduce the tax basis of your shares of our stock by the amount of these distributions until the basis has been reduced to zero after which these distributions will be taxable as capital gain if the shares of our stock are held as capital assets the tax basis as so reduced will be used in computing the capital gain or loss if any realized upon sale of the shares of our stock any loss upon a sale or exchange of shares of our stock which were held for six months or less after application of certain holding period rules will generally be treated as a longterm capital loss to the extent you previously received capital gain distributions with respect to these shares of our stock 

 

upon the sale or exchange of any shares of our stock to or with a person other than us or a sale or exchange of all shares of our stock whether actually or constructively owned with us you will generally recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your adjusted tax basis in these shares of our stock this gain will be capital gain if you held these shares of our stock as a capital asset 

 

if we redeem any of your shares in us the treatment can only be determined on the basis of particular facts at the time of redemption in general you will recognize gain or loss as opposed to dividend income equal to the difference between the amount received by you in the redemption and your adjusted tax basis in your shares redeemed if such redemption 1 results in a “complete termination” of your interest in all classes of our equity securities 2 is a “substantially disproportionate redemption” or 3 is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” with respect to you in applying these tests you must take into account your ownership of all classes of our equity securities eg common stock preferred stock depositary shares and warrants you also must take into account any equity securities that are considered to be constructively owned by you 

 

if as a result of a redemption by us of your shares you no longer own either actually or constructively any of our equity securities or only own actually and constructively an insubstantial percentage of our equity securities then it is probable that the redemption of your shares would be considered “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” and thus would result in gain or loss to you however whether a distribution is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” depends on all of the facts and circumstances and if you rely on any of these tests at the time of redemption you should consult your tax advisor to determine their application to the particular situation 

 

generally if the redemption does not meet the tests described above then the proceeds received by you from the redemption of your shares will be treated as a distribution taxable as a dividend to the extent of the allocable portion of current or accumulated earnings and profits if the redemption is taxed as a dividend your adjusted tax basis in the redeemed shares will be transferred to any other shareholdings in us that you own if you own no other shareholdings in us under certain circumstances such basis may be transferred to a related person or it may be lost entirely 

 

gain from the sale or exchange of our shares held for more than one year is taxed at a maximum longterm capital gain rate which is currently 15 pursuant to internal revenue service guidance we may classify portions of our capital gain dividends as gains eligible for the longterm capital gains rate or as gain taxable to individual stockholders at a maximum rate of 25 

 

on march 30 2010 the president signed into law the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 which requires us stockholders who meet certain requirements and are individuals estates or certain trusts to pay 

an additional 38 tax on among other things dividends on and capital gains from the sale or other disposition of stock for taxable years beginning after december 31 2012 us stockholders should consult their tax advisors regarding the effect if any of this legislation on their ownership and disposition of shares of our stock 

 

treatment of taxexempt us stockholders taxexempt entities including qualified employee pension and profit sharing trusts and individual retirement accounts “exempt organizations” generally are exempt from federal income taxation however they are subject to taxation on their unrelated business taxable income “ubti” the internal revenue service has issued a published revenue ruling that dividend distributions from a reit to an exempt employee pension trust do not constitute ubti provided that the shares of the reit are not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business of the exempt employee pension trust based on this ruling amounts distributed by us to exempt organizations generally should not constitute ubti however if an exempt organization finances its acquisition of the shares of our stock with debt a portion of its income from us will constitute ubti pursuant to the “debt financed property” rules likewise a portion of the exempt organization’s income from us would constitute ubti if we held a residual interest in a real estate mortgage investment conduit 

 

in addition in certain circumstances a pension trust that owns more than 10 of our stock is required to treat a percentage of our dividends as ubti this rule applies to a pension trust holding more than 10 of our stock only if 1 the percentage of our income that is ubti determined as if we were a pension trust is at least 5 2 we qualify as a reit by reason of the modification of the five or fewer requirement that allows beneficiaries of the pension trust to be treated as holding shares in proportion to their actuarial interests in the pension trust and 3 either i one pension trust owns more than 25 of the value of our stock or ii a group of pension trusts individually holding more than 10 of the value of our stock collectively own more than 50 of the value of our stock 

 

backup withholding and information reporting under certain circumstances you may be subject to backup withholding at applicable rates on payments made with respect to or cash proceeds of a sale or exchange of shares of our stock backup withholding will apply only if you 1 fail to provide a correct taxpayer identification number which if you are an individual is ordinarily your social security number 2 furnish an incorrect taxpayer identification number 3 are notified by the internal revenue service that you have failed to properly report payments of interest or dividends or 4 fail to certify under penalties of perjury that you have furnished a correct taxpayer identification number and that the internal revenue service has not notified you that you are subject to backup withholding 

 

backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients such as corporations and taxexempt organizations you should consult with a tax advisor regarding qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining an exemption backup withholding is not an additional tax rather the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a stockholder will be allowed as a credit against such stockholder’s united states federal income tax liability and may entitle such stockholder to a refund provided that the required information is provided to the internal revenue service in addition withholding a portion of capital gain distributions made to stockholders may be required for stockholders who fail to certify their nonforeign status 

 

taxation of foreign stockholders the following summary applies to you only if you are a foreign person the federal taxation of foreign persons is a highly complex matter that may be affected by many considerations 

 

except as discussed below distributions to you of cash generated by our real estate operations in the form of ordinary dividends but not by the sale or exchange of our capital assets generally will be subject to us withholding tax at a rate of 30 unless an applicable tax treaty reduces that tax and you file with us the required form evidencing the lower rate 

 

in general you will be subject to united states federal income tax on a graduated rate basis rather than withholding with respect to your investment in our stock if such investment is “effectively connected” with your conduct of a trade or business in the united states a corporate foreign stockholder that receives income that is or is treated as effectively connected with a united states trade or business may also be subject to the branch profits tax which is payable in addition to regular united states corporate income tax the following discussion will apply to foreign stockholders whose investment in us is not so effectively connected we expect to withhold united states 

income tax as described below on the gross amount of any distributions paid to you unless 1 you file an internal revenue service form w8eci with us claiming that the distribution is “effectively connected” or 2 certain other exceptions apply 

 

distributions by us that are attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a united states real property interest will be taxed to you under the foreign investment in real property tax act of 1980 “firpta” as if these distributions were gains “effectively connected” with a united states trade or business accordingly you will be taxed at the normal capital gain rates applicable to a us stockholder on these amounts subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals distributions subject to firpta may also be subject to a branch profits tax in the hands of a corporate foreign stockholder that is not entitled to treaty exemption 

 

we will be required to withhold from distributions subject to firpta and remit to the internal revenue service 35 of designated capital gain dividends or if greater 35 of the amount of any distributions that could be designated as capital gain dividends in addition if we designate prior distributions as capital gain dividends subsequent distributions up to the amount of the prior distributions not withheld against will be treated as capital gain dividends for purposes of withholding 

 

for taxable years beginning after october 22 2004 any capital gain dividend with respect to any class of stock that is “regularly traded” on an established securities market will be treated as an ordinary dividend if the foreign stockholder did not own more than 5 of such class of stock at any time during the taxable year once this provision takes effect foreign stockholders generally will not be required to report distributions received from us on us federal income tax returns and all distributions treated as dividends for us federal income tax purposes including any capital gain dividend will be subject to a 30 us withholding tax unless reduced under an applicable income tax treaty as discussed above in addition the branch profits tax will no longer apply to such distributions 

 

unless our shares constitute a “united states real property interest” within the meaning of firpta or are effectively connected with a us trade or business a sale of our shares by you generally will not be subject to united states taxation our shares will not constitute a united states real property interest if we qualify as a “domestically controlled reit” we believe that we and expect to continue to qualify as a domestically controlled reit a domestically controlled reit is a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50 in value of its shares is held directly or indirectly by foreign stockholders however if you are a nonresident alien individual who is present in the united states for 183 days or more during the taxable year and certain other conditions apply you will be subject to a 30 tax on such capital gains in any event a purchaser of our shares from you will not be required under firpta to withhold on the purchase price if the purchased shares are “regularly traded” on an established securities market or if we are a domestically controlled reit otherwise under firpta the purchaser may be required to withhold 10 of the purchase price and remit such amount to the internal revenue service 

 

backup withholding tax and information reporting will generally not apply to distributions paid to you outside the united states that are treated as 1 dividends to which the 30 or lower treaty rate withholding tax discussed above applies 2 capital gains dividends or 3 distributions attributable to gain from the sale or exchange by us of us real property interests payment of the proceeds of a sale of stock within the united states or conducted through certain us related financial intermediaries is subject to both backup withholding and information reporting unless the beneficial owner certifies under penalties of perjury that he or she is not a us person and the payor does not have actual knowledge that the beneficial owner is a us person or otherwise established an exemption you may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for refund with the internal revenue service 

 

recently enacted legislation will require after december 31 2012 withholding at a rate of 30 on dividends in respect of and gross proceeds from the sale of shares of our stock held by or through certain foreign financial institutions including investment funds unless such institution enters into an agreement with the secretary of the treasury to report on an annual basis information with respect to shares in the institution held by certain us persons and by certain nonus entities that are wholly or partially owned by us persons and to withhold on certain payments accordingly the entity through which shares of stock is held will affect the determination of 

whether such withholding is required similarly dividends in respect of and gross proceeds from the sale of shares of our stock held by an investor that is a nonfinancial nonus entity will be subject to withholding at a rate of 30 unless such entity either i certifies to us that such entity does not have any “substantial united states owners” or ii provides certain information regarding the entity’s “substantial united states owners” which we will in turn provide to the secretary of the treasury we will not pay any additional amounts to any stockholders in respect of any amounts withheld foreign persons are encouraged to consult with their tax advisors regarding the possible implications of the legislation on their investment in shares of our stock

forwardlooking statements and risk factors 

 

this section discusses the most significant factors that affect our business operations and financial condition it does not describe all risks and uncertainties applicable to us our industry or ownership of our securities if any of the following risks as well as other risks and uncertainties that are not yet identified or that we currently think are not material actually occur we could be materially adversely affected in that event the value of our securities could decline 

 

this annual report on form 10k and the documents incorporated by reference contain statements that constitute “forwardlooking statements” as that term is defined in the federal securities laws these forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to those regarding 

 

  

when we use words such as “may” “will” “intend” “should” “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “project” “estimate” or similar expressions we are making forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties our expected results may not be achieved and 

actual results may differ materially from our expectations this may be a result of various factors including but not limited to 

 

  

risk factors related to our operators’ revenues and expenses 

 

our investment property operators’ revenues are primarily driven by occupancy medicare and medicaid reimbursement if applicable and private pay rates expenses for these facilities are primarily driven by the costs of labor food utilities taxes insurance and rent or debt service revenues from government reimbursement have and may continue to come under pressure due to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls liability insurance and staffing costs continue to increase for our operators to the extent that any decrease in revenues andor any increase in operating expenses result in a property not generating enough cash to make payments to us the credit of our operator and the value of other collateral would have to be relied upon 

 

the recent credit and liquidity crisis and the weakened economy may have a lingering adverse effect on our operators and tenants including their ability to access credit or maintain occupancy rates if the operations cash flows or financial condition of our operators are materially adversely impacted by economic conditions our revenue and operations may be adversely affected 

increased competition may affect our operators’ ability to meet their obligations to us 

 

the operators of our properties compete on a local and regional basis with operators of properties and other health care providers that provide comparable services we cannot be certain that the operators of all of our facilities will be able to achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us our operators are expected to encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to attract residents or expand their businesses 

 

risk factors related to obligor bankruptcies 

 

we are exposed to the risk that our obligors may not be able to meet the rent principal and interest or other payments due us which may result in an obligor bankruptcy or insolvency or that an obligor might become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings for other reasons although our operating lease agreements provide us with the right to evict a tenant demand immediate payment of rent and exercise other remedies and our loans provide us with the right to terminate any funding obligation demand immediate repayment of principal and unpaid interest foreclose on the collateral and exercise other remedies the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization an obligor in bankruptcy or subject to insolvency proceedings may be able to limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent in the case of a lease or to receive unpaid principal and interest in the case of a loan and to exercise other rights and remedies 

 

we may be required to fund certain expenses eg real estate taxes and maintenance to preserve the value of an investment property avoid the imposition of liens on a property andor transition a property to a new tenant in some instances we have terminated our lease with a tenant and relet the property to another tenant in some of those situations we have provided working capital loans to and limited indemnification of the new obligor if we cannot transition a leased property to a new tenant we may take possession of that property which may expose us to certain successor liabilities should such events occur our revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely affected 

 

transfers of health care facilities may require regulatory approvals and these facilities may not have efficient alternative uses 

 

transfers of health care facilities to successor operators frequently are subject to regulatory approvals or notifications including but not limited to change of ownership approvals under certificate of need “con” laws state licensure laws and medicare and medicaid provider arrangements that are not required for transfers of other types of real estate the replacement of a health care facility operator could be delayed by the approval process of any federal state or local agency necessary for the transfer of the facility or the replacement of the operator licensed to manage the facility alternatively given the specialized nature of our facilities we may be required to spend substantial time and funds to adapt these properties to other uses if we are unable to timely transfer properties to successor operators or find efficient alternative uses our revenue and operations may be adversely affected 

 

risk factors related to government regulations 

 

our obligors’ businesses are affected by government reimbursement and private payor rates to the extent that an operatortenant receives a significant portion of its revenues from government payors primarily medicare and medicaid such revenues may be subject to statutory and regulatory changes retroactive rate adjustments recovery of program overpayments or setoffs administrative rulings policy interpretations payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers government funding restrictions at a program level or with respect to specific facilities and interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing government investigations and audits at such property in recent years government payors have frozen or reduced payments to health care providers due to budgetary pressures health care reimbursement will likely continue to be of paramount importance to federal and state authorities we cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or effect any future legislative reforms may have on the financial condition of our obligors and properties there can be no assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will be available for services provided by any property operator whether the property receives reimbursement from medicare medicaid or private payors significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on an obligor’s liquidity financial 

condition and results of operations which could adversely affect the ability of an obligor to meet its obligations to us see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — reimbursement” above 

 

our operators and tenants generally are subject to extensive federal state local and industryregulated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with any of these laws regulations or standards could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension or decertification from federal and state health care programs loss of license or closure of the facility such actions may have an effect on our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make lease payments to us and therefore adversely impact us see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — other related laws” above 

 

many of our properties may require a license registration andor con to operate failure to obtain a license registration or con or loss of a required license registration or con would prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by the operators or tenants these events could materially adversely affect our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make rent payments to us state and local laws also may regulate the expansion including the addition of new beds or services or acquisition of medical equipment and the construction or renovation of health care facilities by requiring a con or other similar approval from a state agency see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — licensing and certification” above 

 

the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 “arra” which was signed into law on february 17 2009 provides 87 billion in additional federal medicaid funding for states’ medicaid expenditures between october 1 2008 and december 31 2010 on august 10 2010 the president signed into law hr 1586 which mandates a sixmonth extension of the increase in federal medicaid funding for states through june 30 2011 although the enhanced federal medicaid funding is scaled back for the first two quarters of 2011 under both the arra and hr 1586 states meeting certain eligibility requirements will temporarily receive additional money in the form of an increase in the federal medical assistance percentage “fmap” thus for a limited period of time the share of medicaid costs that are paid for by the federal government will go up and each state’s share will go down we cannot predict whether states are or will remain eligible to receive the additional federal medicaid funding or whether the states will have sufficient funds for their medicaid programs we also cannot predict the impact that such broadbased farreaching legislation will have on the us economy or our business 

 

risk factors related to liability claims and insurance costs 

 

in recent years skilled nursing and seniors housing operators have experienced substantial increases in both the number and size of patient care liability claims as a result general and professional liability costs have increased in some markets however a recent report and state survey found that the liability insurance market is beginning to stabilize in most markets in 2008 national average liability loss costs were stable for the first time in nearly a decade stateled tort reform efforts have greatly contributed to decreasing costs in some markets general and professional liability insurance coverage continues to be restricted or very costly which in some cases has caused operators to selfinsure these developments may adversely affect the property operators’ future operations cash flows and financial condition and may have a material adverse effect on the property operators’ ability to meet their obligations to us 

 

risk factors related to acquisitions 

 

we are exposed to the risk that some of our acquisitions may not prove to be successful we could encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired properties including contingent liabilities and acquired properties might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business if we agree to provide construction funding to an operatortenant and the project is not completed we may need to take steps to ensure completion of the project moreover if we issue equity securities or incur additional debt or both to finance future acquisitions it may reduce our per share financial results these costs may negatively affect our results of operations 

risk factors related to joint ventures 

 

we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into partnerships or joint ventures with other persons or entities joint venture investments involve risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership including the possibility that our partner might become insolvent refuse to make capital contributions when due or otherwise fail to meet its obligations which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments that our partner might at any time have economic or other business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our interests or goals that we could become engaged in a dispute with our partner which could require us to expend additional resources to resolve such disputes and could have an adverse impact on the operations and profitability of the joint venture and that our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests in addition our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted in some instances we andor our partner may have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partner’s interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction our ability to acquire our partner’s interest may be limited if we do not have sufficient cash available borrowing capacity or other capital resources in such event we may be forced to sell our interest in the joint venture when we would otherwise prefer to retain it joint ventures may require us to share decisionmaking authority with our partners which could limit our ability to control the properties in the joint ventures even when we have a controlling interest certain major decisions may require partner approval such as the sale acquisition or financing of a property 

 

risk factors related to life sciences facilities 

 

our tenants in the life sciences industry face high levels of regulation expense and uncertainty that may adversely affect their ability to make payments to us research development and clinical testing of products and technologies can be very expensive and sources of funds may not be available to our life sciences tenants in the future the products and technologies that are developed and manufactured by our life sciences tenants may require regulatory approval prior to being made marketed sold and used the regulatory process can be costly long and unpredictable even after a tenant gains regulatory approval and market acceptance the product still presents regulatory and liability risks such as safety concerns competition from new products and eventually the expiration of patent protection these factors may affect the ability of our life sciences tenants to make timely payments to us which may adversely affect our revenue and operations 

 

risk factors related to indebtedness 

 

permanent financing for our investments is typically provided through a combination of public and private offerings of debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt the incurrence or assumption of indebtedness may cause us to become more leveraged which could 1 require us to dedicate a greater portion of our cash flow to the payment of debt service 2 make us more vulnerable to a downturn in the economy 3 limit our ability to obtain additional financing or 4 negatively affect our credit ratings or outlook by one or more of the noted rating agencies 

 

our debt agreements contain various covenants restrictions and events of default among other things these provisions require us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness create liens and make investments or acquisitions breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness in addition to any other indebtedness crossdefaulted against such instruments these defaults could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

risk factors related to our credit ratings 

 

we plan to manage the company to maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile but there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the noted rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity andor financial condition 

risk factors related to interest rate swaps 

 

we enter into interest rate swap agreements from time to time to manage some of our exposure to interest rate volatility these swap agreements involve risks such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements in addition these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates when we use forwardstarting interest rate swaps there is a risk that we will not complete the longterm borrowing against which the swap is intended to hedge if such events occur our results of operations may be adversely affected 

 

risk factors related to environmental laws 

 

under various federal and state laws owners or operators of real estate may be required to respond to the presence or release of hazardous substances on the property and may be held liable for property damage personal injuries or penalties that result from environmental contamination or exposure to hazardous substances we may become liable to reimburse the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination generally such liability attaches to a person based on the person’s relationship to the property our tenants or borrowers are primarily responsible for the condition of the property moreover we review environmental site assessments of the properties that we own or encumber prior to taking an interest in them those assessments are designed to meet the “all appropriate inquiry” standard which we believe qualifies us for the innocent purchaser defense if environmental liabilities arise based upon such assessments we do not believe that any of our properties are subject to material environmental contamination however environmental liabilities may be present in our properties and we may incur costs to remediate contamination which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition or the business or financial condition of our obligors 

 

risk factors related to facilities that require entrance fees 

 

certain of our senior housing facilities require the payment of an upfront entrance fee by the resident a portion of which may be refundable by the operator some of these facilities are subject to substantial oversight by state regulators relating to these funds as a result of this oversight residents of these facilities may have a variety of rights including for example the right to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time and certain lien rights the oversight and rights of residents within these facilities may have an effect on the revenue or operations of the operators of such facilities and therefore may negatively impact us 

 

risk factors related to facilities under construction or development 

 

at any given time we may be in the process of constructing one or more new facilities that ultimately will require a con and license before they can be utilized by the operator for their intended use the operator also may need to obtain medicare and medicaid certification and enter into medicare and medicaid provider agreements andor third party payor contracts in the event that the operator is unable to obtain the necessary con licensure certification provider agreements or contracts after the completion of construction there is a risk that we will not be able to earn any revenues on the facility until either the initial operator obtains a license or certification to operate the new facility and the necessary provider agreements or contracts or we can find and contract with a new operator that is able to obtain a license to operate the facility for its intended use and the necessary provider agreements or contracts 

 

in connection with our renovation redevelopment development and related construction activities we may be unable to obtain or suffer delays in obtaining necessary zoning landuse building occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations these factors could result in increased costs or our abandonment of these projects in addition we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms which may render us unable to proceed with our development activities and we may not be able to complete construction and leaseup of a property on schedule which could result in increased debt service expense or construction costs 

 

additionally the time frame required for development construction and leaseup of these properties means that we may have to wait years for significant cash returns because we are required to make cash distributions to our stockholders if the cash flow from operations or refinancing is not sufficient we may be forced to borrow 

additional money to fund such distributions newly developed and acquired properties may not produce the cash flow that we expect which could adversely affect our overall financial performance 

 

in deciding whether to acquire or develop a particular property we make assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property in particular we estimate the return on our investment based on expected occupancy and rental rates if our financial projections with respect to a new property are inaccurate and the property is unable to achieve the expected occupancy and rental rates it may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment our estimate of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove to be inaccurate which may result in our failure to meet our profitability goals additionally we may acquire new properties that are not fully leased and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with that property 

 

we do not know if our tenants will renew their existing leases and if they do not we may be unable to lease the properties on as favorable terms or at all 

 

we cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases at the end of their lease terms which expire at various times if these leases are not renewed we would be required to find other tenants to occupy those properties or sell them there can be no assurance that we would be able to identify suitable replacement tenants or enter into leases with new tenants on terms as favorable to us as the current leases or that we would be able to lease those properties at all 

 

our ownership of properties through ground leases exposes us to the loss of such properties upon breach or termination of the ground leases 

 

we have acquired an interest in certain of our properties by acquiring a leasehold interest in the property on which the building is located and we may acquire additional properties in the future through the purchase of interests in ground leases as the lessee under a ground lease we are exposed to the possibility of losing the property upon termination of the ground lease or an earlier breach of the ground lease by us 

 

illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties 

 

real estate investments are relatively illiquid our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in economic and other conditions will be limited no assurances can be given that we will recognize full value for any property that we are required to sell for liquidity reasons our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition we are exposed to the risks inherent in concentrating investments in real estate and in particular the seniors housing and health care industries a downturn in the real estate industry could adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to sell properties for a price or on terms acceptable to us 

 

risk factors related to reinvestment of sale proceeds 

 

from time to time we will have cash available from 1 the proceeds of sales of our securities 2 principal payments on our loans receivable and 3 the sale of properties including nonelective dispositions under the terms of master leases or similar financial support arrangements in order to maintain current revenues and continue generating attractive returns we expect to reinvest these proceeds in a timely manner we compete for real estate investments with a broad variety of potential investors this competition for attractive investments may negatively affect our ability to make timely investments on terms acceptable to us 

 

failure to properly manage our rapid growth could distract our management or increase our expenses 

 

we have experienced rapid growth and development in a relatively short period of time and expect to continue this rapid growth in the future this growth has resulted in increased levels of responsibility for our management future property acquisitions could place significant additional demands on and require us to expand our management resources and personnel our failure to manage any such rapid growth effectively could harm our business and in particular our financial condition results of operations and cash flows which could negatively 

affect our ability to make distributions to stockholders our growth could also increase our capital requirements which may require us to issue potentially dilutive equity securities and incur additional debt 

 

we might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

 

we intend to operate as a reit under the internal revenue code and believe we have and will continue to operate in such a manner if we lose our status as a reit we will face serious income tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for satisfying our obligations and for distribution to our stockholders because 

 

  

since reit qualification requires us to meet a number of complex requirements it is possible that we may fail to fulfill them and if we do our earnings will be reduced by the amount of us federal and other income taxes owed a reduction in our earnings would affect the amount we could distribute to our stockholders if we do not qualify as a reit we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders since a nonreit is not required in order to maintain reit status or avoid an excise tax to pay dividends to stockholders see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations” for a discussion of the provisions of the internal revenue code that apply to us and the effects of failure to qualify as a reit 

 

in addition if we fail to qualify as a reit all distributions to stockholders would continue to be treated as dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits although corporate stockholders may be eligible for the dividends received deduction and individual stockholders may be eligible for taxation at the rates generally applicable to longterm capital gains currently at a maximum rate of 15 with respect to distributions 

 

as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to implement our business strategy and would adversely affect the value of our common stock 

 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to remain qualified as a reit although we believe that we qualify as a reit we cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify or remain qualified as a reit for us federal income tax purposes see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations” included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

the 90 annual distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions 

 

to comply with the 90 distribution requirement applicable to reits and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax we must make distributions to our stockholders see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations — qualification as a reit — annual distribution requirements” included in this annual report on form 10k although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the reit distribution requirement it is possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90 distribution requirement or we may decide to retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation this may be due to timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses on the one hand and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income on the other hand in addition nondeductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of noncash deductions may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90 distribution requirement in the event that timing differences occur or we deem it appropriate to retain cash we may borrow funds issue additional equity securities although we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so pay taxable 

stock dividends if possible distribute other property or securities or engage in another transaction intended to enable us to meet the reit distribution requirements this may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations 

 

the amount of additional indebtedness we may incur is limited by the terms of our line of credit arrangement and the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes in addition adverse economic conditions may impact the availability of additional funds or could cause the terms on which we are able to borrow additional funds to become unfavorable in those circumstances we may be required to raise additional equity in the capital markets our access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control including rising interest rates inflation and other general market conditions and the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of the shares of our capital stock we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the capital necessary to make future investments or to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature 

 

the lease of qualified health care properties to a taxable reit subsidiary is subject to special requirements 

 

we intend to lease certain qualified health care properties we acquire from operators to a taxable reit subsidiary or a limited liability company of which the taxable reit subsidiary is a member which lessee will contract with such operators or a related party to operate the health care operations at these properties the rents from this taxable reit subsidiary lessee structure will be treated as qualifying rents from real property if 1 they are paid pursuant to an armslength lease of a qualified health care property with a taxable reit subsidiary and 2 the operator qualifies as an eligible independent contractor if any of these conditions are not satisfied then the rents will not be qualifying rents see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations — qualification as a reit — income tests” 

 

if certain saleleaseback transactions are not characterized by the irs as “true leases” we may be subject to adverse tax consequences 

 

we may purchase properties and lease them back to the sellers of such properties we intend for any such saleleaseback transaction to be structured in such a manner that the lease will be characterized as a “true lease” thereby allowing us to be treated as the owner of the property for us federal income tax purposes however depending on the terms of any specific transaction the irs might take the position that the transaction is not a “true lease” but is more properly treated in some other manner in the event any saleleaseback transaction is challenged and successfully recharacterized by the irs we would not be entitled to claim the deductions for depreciation and cost recovery generally available to an owner of property furthermore if a saleleaseback transaction were so recharacterized we might fail to satisfy the reit asset tests or income tests and consequently could lose our reit status effective with the year of recharacterization see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations — qualification as a reit — asset tests” and “— income tests” alternatively the amount of our reit taxable income could be recalculated which may cause us to fail to meet the reit annual distribution requirements for a taxable year see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations — qualification as a reit — annual distribution requirements” 

 

other risk factors 

 

we are also subject to other risks first our second restated certificate of incorporation and second amended and restated bylaws contain antitakeover provisions staggered board provisions restrictions on share ownership and transfer and super majority stockholder approval requirements for business combinations that could make it more difficult for or even prevent a third party from acquiring us without the approval of our incumbent board of directors provisions and agreements that inhibit or discourage takeover attempts could reduce the market value of our common stock 

 

additionally we are dependent on key personnel although we have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers losing any one of them could at least temporarily have an adverse impact on our operations we believe that losing more than one could have a material adverse impact on our business

executive summary 

 

company overview 

 

health care reit inc is a real estate investment trust “reit” that has been at the forefront of senior housing and health care real estate since the company was founded in 1970 we are an sp 500 company headquartered in toledo ohio and our portfolio spans the full spectrum of senior housing and health care real estate including senior housing communities skilled nursing facilities medical office buildings inpatient and outpatient medical centers and life science facilities our capital programs when combined with comprehensive planning development and property management services make us a singlesource solution for acquiring planning developing managing repositioning and monetizing real estate assets the following table summarizes our portfolio as of december 31 2010 

 

 

 

 

  

health care industry 

 

the demand for health care services and consequently health care properties is projected to reach unprecedented levels in the near future the centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” projects that national health expenditures will rise to 35 trillion in 2015 or 182 of gross domestic product “gdp” the average annual growth in national health expenditures for 2009 through 2019 is expected to be 63 which is 02 faster than prehealth care reform estimates 

 

while demographics are the primary driver of demand economic conditions and availability of services contribute to health care service utilization rates we believe the health care property market may be less susceptible to fluctuations and economic downturns relative to other property sectors investor interest in the market remains strong especially in specific sectors such as medical office buildings regardless of the current stringent lending environment as a reit we believe we are situated to benefit from any turbulence in the capital markets due to our access to capital 

 

the total us population is projected to increase by 204 through 2030 the elderly population aged 65 and over is projected to increase by 792 through 2030 the elderly are an important component of health care 

utilization especially independent living services assisted living services skilled nursing services inpatient and outpatient hospital services and physician ambulatory care most health care services are provided within a health care facility such as a hospital a physician’s office or a senior housing facility therefore we believe there will be continued demand for companies such as ours with expertise in health care real estate 

 

the following chart illustrates the projected increase in the elderly population aged 65 and over 

 

 

source us census bureau 

 

health care real estate investment opportunities tend to increase as demand for health care services increases we recognize the need for health care real estate as it correlates to health care service demand health care providers require real estate to house their businesses and expand their services we believe that investment opportunities in health care real estate will continue to be present due to 

 

  

health reform laws 

 

on march 23 2010 the president signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act “ppaca” and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 which amends the ppaca collectively the “health reform laws” the health reform laws contain various provisions that may directly impact us or the operators and tenants of our properties some provisions of the health reform laws may have a positive impact on our operators’ or tenants’ revenues by for example increasing coverage of uninsured individuals while others may have a negative impact on the reimbursement of our operators or tenants by for example altering the market basket adjustments for certain types of health care facilities the health reform laws also enhance certain fraud and abuse penalty provisions that could apply to our operators and tenants in the event of one or more violations of the federal health care regulatory laws in addition there are provisions that impact the health coverage that we and our operators and tenants provide to our respective employees we cannot predict whether the existing health reform laws or future health care reform legislation or regulatory changes will have a material impact on our operators’ or tenants’ property or business if the operations cash flows or financial condition of our operators and tenants are materially adversely impacted by the health reform laws or future legislation our revenue and operations may be adversely affected as well further on february 2 2011 the us senate refused to pass an overhaul repeal of the health reform laws and the focus has now shifted to attempts to repeal or amend individual sections of the health reform laws further federal courts are also considering and in some cases have ruled on the legality of the health reform laws we cannot predict whether any of these attempts to repeal or amend the health reform laws will be successful nor can we predict the impact that such a repeal or amendment would have on our operators and tenants 

impact to reimbursement of the operators and tenants of our properties the health reform laws provide for various changes to the reimbursement that our operators and tenants may receive one such change is a reduction to the market basket adjustments for inpatient acute hospitals longterm care hospitals inpatient rehabilitation facilities home health agencies psychiatric hospitals hospice care and outpatient hospitals beginning in 2010 the otherwise applicable percentage increase to the market basket for inpatient acute hospitals will decrease beginning in 2012 inpatient acute hospitals will also face a downward adjustment of the annual percentage increase to the market basket rate by a “productivity adjustment” the productivity adjustment may cause the annual percentage increase to be less than zero which would mean that inpatient acute hospitals could face payment rates for a fiscal year that are less than the payment rates for the preceding year 

 

a similar productivity adjustment also applies to skilled nursing facilities beginning in 2012 which means that the payment rates for skilled nursing facilities may decrease from one year to the next longterm care hospitals will face a specified percentage decrease in their annual update for discharges beginning in 2010 additionally beginning in 2012 longterm care hospitals will be subject to the productivity adjustments which may decrease the federal payment rates for longterm care hospitals similar productivity adjustments and other adjustments to payment rates will apply to inpatient rehabilitation facilities psychiatric hospitals and outpatient hospitals beginning in 2010 

 

the health reform laws revise other reimbursement provisions that may affect our business for example the health reform laws mandate a oneyear extension of the exceptions for medical therapy caps which will be applicable though december 31 2010 the health reform laws also reduce states’ medicaid disproportionate share hospital “dsh” allotments starting in 2014 through 2020 these allotments would have provided additional funding for dsh hospitals that are operators or tenants of our properties and thus any reduction might negatively impact these operators or tenants 

 

additionally beginning in fiscal year 2015 medicare payments will decrease to hospitals for treatment associated with hospital acquired conditions this decreased payment rate may negatively impact our operators or tenants the health reform laws also call for reductions in payments for discharges beginning october 1 2012 in order to account for excess readmissions while the exact amount of the reduction is not yet known a reduction in payments to our operators or tenants may affect their ability to make payments to us 

 

ppaca additionally calls for the creation of the independent payment advisory board the “board” which will be responsible for establishing payment polices including recommendations in the event that medicare costs exceed a certain threshold proposals for recommendations submitted by the board prior to december 31 2018 may not include recommendations that would reduce payments for hospitals skilled nursing facilities and physicians among other providers prior to december 31 2019 the health reform laws also create other mechanisms that could permit significant changes to payment for example ppaca establishes the center for medicare and medicaid innovation to test innovative payment and service delivery models to reduce program expenditures through the use of demonstration programs that can waive existing reimbursement methodologies the health reform laws also provide additional medicaid funding to allow states to carry out mandated expansion of medicaid coverage to certain financiallyeligible individuals beginning in 2014 and also permits states to expand their medicaid coverage to these individuals as early as april 1 2010 if certain conditions are met 

 

additionally although the health reform laws delayed until at least october 1 2011 the implementation of the resource utilization group version four “rugiv” which revises the payment classification system for skilled nursing facilities the recently enacted medicare and medicaid extenders act of 2010 repealed this delay retroactively to october 1 2010 the health reform laws also extend certain payment rules related to longterm acute care hospitals found in the medicare medicaid and schip extension act of 2007 

 

finally many other changes resulting from the health reform laws or implementing regulations or guidance may negatively impact our operators and tenants we will continue to monitor and evaluate the health reform laws and implementing regulations and guidance to determine other potential effects of the reform 

 

impact of fraud and abuse provisions the health reform laws revise health care fraud and abuse provisions that will affect our operators and tenants specifically ppaca allows for up to treble damages under the federal false claims act for violations related to statebased health insurance exchanges authorized by the health 

reform laws which will be implemented beginning in 2014 the health reform laws also impose new civil monetary penalties for false statements or actions that lead to delayed inspections with penalties of up to 15000 per day for failure to grant timely access and up to 50000 for a knowing violation the health reform laws also provide for additional funding to investigate and prosecute health care fraud and abuse accordingly the increased penalties under ppaca for fraud and abuse violations may have a negative impact on our operators and tenants in the event that the government brings an enforcement action or subjects them to penalties 

 

further as recently as february 2 2011 cms published final rulemaking to implement the enhanced provider and supplier screening provisions called for in the health reform laws under the final rule beginning march 25 2011 all enrolling and participating providers and suppliers will be assessed an annual administrative fee and be placed in one of three risk levels limited moderate and high based on an assessment of the individual’s or entity’s overall risk of fraud waste and abuse this rule also allows for the temporary suspension of medicare payments to providers or suppliers in the event cms receives credible information that an overpayment fraud or willful misrepresentation has occurred the health reform laws granted the secretary of the department of health and human services significant discretionary authority to suspend exclude or impose fines on providers and suppliers based on the agency’s determination that such a provider or supplier is “highrisk” and as a result this final rulemaking has the potential to materially adversely affect our operators and tenants who may be evaluated under the enhanced screening process 

 

additionally provisions of title vi of ppaca are designed to increase transparency and program integrity by skilled nursing facilities other nursing facilities and similar providers specifically skilled nursing facilities and other providers and suppliers will be required to institute compliance and ethics programs additionally ppaca makes it easier for consumers to file complaints against nursing homes by mandating that states establish complaint websites the provisions calling for enhanced transparency will increase the administrative burden and costs on these providers 

 

impact to the health care plans offered to our employees the health reform laws will affect employers that provide health plans to their employees the new laws will change the tax treatment of the medicare part d retiree drug subsidy and extend dependent coverage for dependents up to age 26 among other changes we are evaluating our health care plans in light of these changes these changes may affect our operators and tenants as well 

 

medicare program reimbursement changes 

 

in recent months cms released a number of rulemakings that may potentially increase or decrease the government reimbursement of our operators and tenants to the extent that any of these rulemakings decrease government reimbursement to our operators and tenants our revenue and operations may be indirectly adversely affected 

 

on august 16 2010 cms issued a final rule updating the longterm acute care hospital prospective payment system for fiscal year 2011 among other things the final rule updates payment rates for acute care and longterm care hospitals and implements certain provisions of the health reform laws in the rule cms finalized an update of 25 for inflation with a cut of 05 as required by the health reform laws and a negative 25 documentation and coding adjustment for longterm care hospitals cms also released a notice and comment rulemaking for the prospective payment system and consolidated billing for skilled nursing facilities for fiscal year 2011 on july 22 2010 cms adjusts the nursing home payment rates for fiscal year 2011 by including a market basket increase factor of 23 and a negative 06 percentage point forecast error adjustment which would result in a net increase update of 17 for nursing home rates 

 

cms annually adjusts the medicare physician fee schedule payment rates based on an update formula that includes application of the sustainable growth rate “sgr” on november 29 2010 cms published the calendar year 2011 physician fee schedule final rule among other things cms preliminary estimates in the final rule that the calendar year 2011 sgr formula will be negative 134 this measure is a significant change from the figure provided in the proposed rule and will replace the 213 reduction in physician medicare reimbursement in 2010 required by the sgr formula additionally in the final rule cms has eliminated certain cpt consultation codes which could negatively impact the reimbursement levels received by our operators and tenants 

finally on november 24 2010 cms published the calendar year 2011 hospital outpatient prospective payment system “opps” final rule cms estimates that the cumulative effect of all changes to payment rates for calendar year 2011 will have a positive effect resulting in a 25 estimated increase in medicare payments to providers paid under the hopps 

 

economic outlook 

 

the serious economic recession affecting the national and global economy has continued to impact all sectors including to a somewhat lesser degree health care continuing mixed economic signals have made it difficult to predict when there might be a return to more normal and stable growth rates employment levels and overall economic performance 

 

banks have remained cautious in their lending but significant liquidity has been injected into the senior housing and care markets by various governmentsponsored enterprises in addition there is significant equity investment capital available for certain health care sectors particularly medical office buildings this has had the effect of keeping capitalization rates in these segments generally in line with or even below historic rates debt costs for reits have generally declined over the past 12 months and equity markets for health care reits have remained open for the most part 

 

as a consequence while liquidity remained an important consideration in 2010 we have been more aggressive in pursuing attractive investment opportunities that meet our strategic and underwriting criteria we have also been more active in accessing capital markets during this time we believe the markets in which we invest will continue to offer stable returns during the economic downturn and significant growth potential as and when the economy begins to rebound 

 

business strategy 

 

our primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and enhance stockholder value we seek to pay consistent cash dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual increases in rental and interest income and portfolio growth to meet these objectives we invest across the full spectrum of senior housing and health care real estate and diversify our investment portfolio by property type customer and geographic location 

 

substantially all of our revenues and sources of cash flows from operations are derived from operating lease rentals and interest earned on outstanding loans receivable these items represent our primary source of liquidity to fund distributions and are dependent upon our obligors’ continued ability to make contractual rent and interest payments to us to the extent that our obligors experience operating difficulties and are unable to generate sufficient cash to make payments to us there could be a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity andor financial condition to mitigate this risk we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property and operatortenant our asset management process includes review of monthly financial statements for each property periodic review of obligor credit periodic property inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure real estate taxes letters of credit and other collateral in monitoring our portfolio our personnel use a proprietary database to collect and analyze propertyspecific data additionally we conduct extensive research to ascertain industry trends and risks through these asset management and research efforts we are typically able to intervene at an early stage to address payment risk and in so doing support both the collectability of revenue and the value of our investment 

 

in addition to our asset management and research efforts we also structure our investments to help mitigate payment risk operating leases and loans are normally credit enhanced by guaranties andor letters of credit in addition operating leases are typically structured as master leases and loans are generally crossdefaulted and crosscollateralized with other loans operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its affiliates 

 

for the year ended december 31 2010 rental income and interest income represented 86 and 6 respectively of total gross revenues including revenues from discontinued operations substantially all of our operating leases are designed with either fixed or contingent escalating rent structures leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straightline basis over the initial lease period subject to a 

collectability assessment rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period our yield on loans receivable depends upon a number of factors including the stated interest rate the average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments 

 

depending upon the availability and cost of external capital we believe our liquidity is sufficient to fund operations meet debt service obligations both principal and interest make dividend distributions and complete construction projects in process we also anticipate evaluating opportunities to finance future investments new investments are generally funded from temporary borrowings under our unsecured line of credit arrangement internally generated cash and the proceeds from sales of real property our investments generate cash from rent and interest receipts and principal payments on loans receivable permanent capital for future investments which replaces funds drawn under the unsecured line of credit arrangement has historically been provided through a combination of public and private offerings of debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt 

 

depending upon market conditions we believe that new investments will be available in the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to our stockholders we expect to complete gross new investments of approximately 15 billion in 2011 comprised of acquisitionsjoint ventures totaling 13 billion and funded new development of 212 million we anticipate the sale of real property and the repayment of loans receivable totaling 300 million during 2011 it is possible that additional loan repayments or sales of real property may occur in the future to the extent that loan repayments and real property sales exceed new investments our revenues and cash flows from operations could be adversely affected we expect to reinvest the proceeds from any loan repayments and real property sales in new investments to the extent that new investment requirements exceed our available cash onhand we expect to borrow under our unsecured line of credit arrangement at december 31 2010 we had 131570000 of cash and cash equivalents 79069000 of restricted cash and 850000000 of available borrowing capacity under our unsecured line of credit arrangement

key performance indicators trends and uncertainties 

 

we utilize several key performance indicators to evaluate the various aspects of our business these indicators are discussed below and relate to operating performance concentration risk and credit strength management uses these key performance indicators to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results in making operating decisions and for budget planning purposes

credit strength we measure our credit strength both in terms of leverage ratios and coverage ratios our leverage ratios include debt to book capitalization and debt to market capitalization the leverage ratios indicate how much of our balance sheet capitalization is related to longterm debt the coverage ratios indicate our ability to service interest and fixed charges interest secured debt principal amortization and preferred dividends we expect to maintain capitalization ratios and coverage ratios sufficient to maintain compliance with our debt covenants the coverage ratios are based on adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “adjusted ebitda” which is discussed in further detail and reconciled to net income below in “nongaap financial measures” leverage ratios and coverage ratios are widely used by investors analysts and rating agencies in the valuation comparison investment recommendations and rating of companies the following table reflects the recent historical trends for our credit strength measures for the periods presented 

 

 

 

concentration risk we evaluate our concentration risk in terms of asset mix investment mix customer mix and geographic mix concentration risk is a valuable measure in understanding what portion of our investments could be at risk if certain sectors were to experience downturns asset mix measures the portion of our investments that are real property in order to qualify as an equity reit at least 75 of our real estate investments must be real property whereby each property which includes the land buildings improvements intangibles and related rights is owned by us and leased to a tenant pursuant to a longterm operating lease investment mix measures the portion of our investments that relate to our various property types customer mix measures the portion of our investments that 

relate to our top five customers geographic mix measures the portion of our investments that relate to our top five states the following table reflects our recent historical trends of concentration risk for the periods presented 

 

 

 

 

  

we evaluate our key performance indicators in conjunction with current expectations to determine if historical trends are indicative of future results our expected results may not be achieved and actual results may differ materially from our expectations factors that may cause actual results to differ from expected results are described in more detail in “forwardlooking statements and risk factors” and other sections of this annual report on form 10k management regularly monitors economic and other factors to develop strategic and tactical plans designed to improve performance and maximize our competitive position our ability to achieve our financial objectives is dependent upon our ability to effectively execute these plans and to appropriately respond to emerging economic and companyspecific trends please refer to “business” “risk factors” and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for further discussion of these risk factors

senior housing and care properties 

 

the following is a summary of our results of operations for the senior housing and care properties segment dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

the increase in rental income is primarily attributable to the acquisitions of new properties and the conversion of newly constructed senior housing and care properties from which we receive rent certain of our leases contain annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the consumer price index andor changes in the gross operating revenues of the tenant’s properties these escalators are not fixed so no straightline rent is recorded however rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period if gross operating revenues at our facilities andor the consumer price index do not increase a portion of our revenues may not continue to increase sales of real property would offset revenue increases and to the extent that they exceed new acquisitions could result in decreased revenues our leases could renew above or below current rent rates resulting in an increase or decrease in rental income 

 

as discussed in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements we completed two senior housing operating partnerships in 2010 the results of operations for these partnerships have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the dates of acquisition and represent the sole component of resident fees and services property operating expenses and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for this segment

depreciation and amortization increased primarily as a result of new property acquisitions and the conversions of newly constructed investment properties to the extent that we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future our provision for depreciation and amortization will change accordingly

medical facilities 

 

the following is a summary of our results of operations for the medical facilities segment dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

the increase in rental income is primarily attributable to the acquisitions of new properties and the construction conversions of medical facilities from which we receive rent certain of our leases contain annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the consumer price index these escalators are not fixed so no straightline rent is recorded however rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period if the consumer price index does not increase a portion of our revenues may not continue to increase sales of real property would offset revenue increases and to the extent that they exceed new acquisitions 

could result in decreased revenues our leases could renew above or below current rent rates resulting in an increase or decrease in rental income interest income decreased from the prior period primarily due to a decline in outstanding balances for medical facility real estate loans other income is attributable to third party management fee income 

 

interest expense for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 represents 24926000 20584000 and 21828000 respectively of secured debt interest expense offset by interest allocated to discontinued operations the change in secured debt interest expense is primarily due to the net effect and timing of assumptions extinguishments and principal amortizations the following is a summary of our medical facilities secured debt principal activity dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

the increase in property operating expenses and depreciation and amortization is primarily attributable to acquisitions and construction conversions of new medical facilities for which we incur certain property operating expenses offset by property operating expenses associated with discontinued operations

please see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our interest rate swap agreements and their impact on interest expense loan expense represents the amortization of deferred loan costs incurred in connection with the issuance and amendments of debt loan expense is consistent for all years presented

general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues including revenues from discontinued operations for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 were 778 833 and 824 respectively the change from prior year is primarily related to i the recognition of 2853000 of expenses in connection with a performancebased stock grant ii the recognition of 1000000 for the immediate vesting of a stock grant in conjunction with the ceo’s new employment agreement and iii additional salary and benefits to attract and retain appropriate personnel to support our business growth this was partially offset by 3909000 of nonrecurring expenses recognized during the year ended december 31 2009 in connection with the departure of raymond w braun who formerly served as president of the company 

 

the change in preferred dividends is primarily attributable to preferred stock conversions into common stock the following is a summary of our preferred stock activity dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

nongaap financial measures 

 

we believe that net income as defined by us gaap is the most appropriate earnings measurement however we consider ffo to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with us gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation however since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient in response the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” created ffo as a supplemental measure of operating performance for reits that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income ffo as defined by nareit means net income computed in accordance with us gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 

 

net operating income “noi” is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties we define noi as total revenues including tenant reimbursements less property level operating expenses which exclude depreciation and amortization general and administrative expenses impairments and interest expense we believe noi provides investors relevant and useful information because it measures the operating performance of our properties at the property level on an unleveraged basis we use noi to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess the property level performance of our properties 

 

ebitda stands for earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization we believe that ebitda along with net income and cash flow provided from operating activities is an important supplemental measure because it provides additional information to assess and evaluate the performance of our operations a covenant in our line of credit arrangement contains a financial ratio based on a definition of ebitda that is specific to that agreement failure to satisfy this covenant could result in an event of default that could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity andor financial condition due to the materiality of this debt agreement and the financial covenant we have disclosed adjusted ebitda which represents ebitda as defined above and 

adjusted for stockbased compensation expense provision for loan losses and gainloss on extinguishment of debt we primarily utilize adjusted ebitda to measure our adjusted interest coverage ratio which represents adjusted ebitda divided by total interest and our adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio which represents adjusted ebitda divided by fixed charges fixed charges include total interest secured debt principal amortization and preferred dividends our covenant requires an adjusted fixed charge ratio of at least 175 times 

 

other than adjusted ebitda our supplemental reporting measures and similarly entitled financial measures are widely used by investors equity and debt analysts and rating agencies in the valuation comparison rating and investment recommendations of companies management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results and in making operating decisions additionally these measures are utilized by the board of directors to evaluate management adjusted ebitda is used solely to determine our compliance with a financial covenant of our line of credit arrangement and is not being presented for use by investors for any other purpose none of our supplemental measures represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with us gaap and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity finally the supplemental measures as defined by us may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies 

 

the tables below reflect the reconciliation of ffo to net income attributable to common stockholders the most directly comparable us gaap measure for the periods presented the provisions for depreciation and amortization include provisions for depreciation and amortization from discontinued operations noncontrolling interest amounts represent the noncontrolling interests’ share of transaction costs and depreciation and amortization unconsolidated joint venture amounts represent our share of unconsolidated joint ventures’ depreciation and amortization amounts are in thousands except for per share data

critical accounting policies 

 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap which requires us to make estimates and assumptions management considers accounting estimates or assumptions critical if

management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate and are not reasonably likely to change in the future however since these estimates require assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made they bear the risk of change if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations liquidity andor financial condition please refer to note 1 of our audited consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact us there were no material changes to these policies in 2010 

 

the following table presents information about our critical accounting policies as well as the material assumptions used to develop each estimate

impact of inflation 

 

during the past three years inflation has not significantly affected our earnings because of the moderate inflation rate additionally our earnings are primarily longterm investments with fixed rates of return these investments are mainly financed with a combination of equity senior unsecured notes and borrowings under our unsecured line of credit arrangement during inflationary periods which generally are accompanied by rising interest rates our ability to grow may be adversely affected because the yield on new investments may increase at a slower rate than new borrowing costs presuming the current inflation rate remains moderate and longterm interest rates do not increase significantly we believe that inflation will not impact the availability of equity and debt financing for us

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

we are exposed to various market risks including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates we seek to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates by matching the terms of new investments with new longterm fixed rate borrowings to the extent possible we may or may not elect to use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate exposure these decisions are principally based on our policy to match our variable rate investments with comparable borrowings but are also based on the general trend in interest rates at the applicable dates and our perception of the future volatility of interest rates this section is presented to provide a discussion of the risks associated with potential fluctuations in interest rates 

 

we historically borrow on our unsecured line of credit arrangement to acquire construct or make loans relating to health care and senior housing properties then as market conditions dictate we will issue equity or longterm fixed rate debt to repay the borrowings under the unsecured line of credit arrangement 

 

a change in interest rates will not affect the interest expense associated with our fixed rate debt interest rate changes however will affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt changes in the interest rate environment upon maturity of this fixed rate debt could have an effect on our future cash flows and earnings depending on whether the debt is replaced with other fixed rate debt variable rate debt or equity or repaid by the sale of assets to illustrate the impact of changes in the interest rate markets we performed a sensitivity analysis on our fixed rate debt instruments whereby we modeled the change in net present values arising from a hypothetical 1 increase in interest rates to determine the instruments’ change in fair value the following table summarizes the analysis performed as of the dates indicated in thousands 

 

 

 

on december 31 2010 we assumed an interest rate swap the “december 2010 swap” for a total notional amount of 12650000 to hedge interest payments associated with longterm libor based borrowings the december 2010 swap has an effective date of december 31 2010 and a maturity date of december 31 2013 the december 2010 swap has the economic effect of fixing 12650000 at 550 plus a credit spread through the swap’s maturity in january 2011 the december 2010 swap was designated as a cash flow hedge and we expect it to be highly effective at offsetting changes in cash flows of interest payments on 12650000 of longterm debt due to changes in the libor swap rate 

 

our variable rate debt including our unsecured line of credit arrangement is reflected at fair value at december 31 2010 we had 300000000 outstanding related to our variable rate line of credit and 103645000 outstanding related to our variable rate secured debt assuming no changes in outstanding balances a 1 increase in interest rates would result in increased annual interest expense of 4036000 at december 31 2009 we had 140000000 outstanding related to our variable rate line of credit and 131952000 outstanding related to our 

variable rate secured debt assuming no changes in outstanding balances a 1 increase in interest rates would have resulted in increased annual interest expense of 2720000 

 

we are subject to risks associated with debt financing including the risk that existing indebtedness may not be refinanced or that the terms of refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of current indebtedness the majority of our borrowings were completed under indentures or contractual agreements that limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur accordingly in the event that we are unable to raise additional equity or borrow money because of these limitations our ability to acquire additional properties may be limited

report of independent registered public accounting firm on internal control over financial reporting 

 

the board of directors and shareholders of health care reit inc 

 

we have audited health care reit inc’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria health care reit inc’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

 

as indicated in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of the merrill gardens partnership the senior star partnership or the strategic medical office partnership which are included in the 2010 consolidated financial statements of health care reit inc and cumulatively constitute 15 of total assets at december 31 2010 and 7 and −2 of revenues and net income respectively for the year then ended our audit of the internal control over financial reporting of health care reit inc also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of the aforementioned partnerships because they were acquired in business combinations on september 1 2010 december 30 2010 and december 31 2010 respectively

continuing care retirement communities assisted living facilities skilled nursing facilities and hospitals the medical office building segment is primarily selfmanaged and consists of health care related properties acquired or developed for the medical profession the medical office building leases have lease terms that typically include fixed increasers and operating expense reimbursement our properties include standalone facilities that provide one level of service combination facilities that provide multiple levels of service and communities or campuses that provide a wide range of services the following is a summary of our various property types 

 

independent livingcontinuing care retirement communities 

 

these communities may include one or more of the following property types 

 

independent living facilities independent living facilities are agerestricted multifamily properties with central dining facilities that provide residents access to meals and other services such as housekeeping linen service transportation and social and recreational activities 

 

continuing care retirement communities continuing care retirement communities include a combination of detached homes an independent living facility an assisted living facility andor a skilled nursing facility on one campus these communities are appealing to residents because there is no need for relocating when health and medical needs change resident payment plans vary but can include entrance fees condominium fees and rental fees many of these communities also charge monthly maintenance fees in exchange for a living unit meals and some health services 

 

early stage senior housing early stage senior housing communities contain primarily forsale singlefamily homes townhomes cluster homes mobile homes andor condominiums with no specialized services these communities are typically restricted or targeted to adults at least 55 years of age or older residents generally lead an independent lifestyle communities may include amenities such as a clubhouse golf course and recreational spaces 

 

assisted living facilities 

 

assisted living facilities are state regulated rental properties that provide the same services as independent living facilities but also provide supportive care from trained employees to residents who require assistance with activities of daily living including management of medications bathing dressing toileting ambulating and eating 

 

alzheimer’sdementia care facilities certain assisted living facilities may include state licensed settings that specialize in caring for those afflicted with alzheimer’s disease andor similar forms of dementia

hospitals 

 

our hospitals generally include acute care hospitals inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and longterm acute care hospitals acute care hospitals provide a wide range of inpatient and outpatient services including but not limited to surgery rehabilitation therapy and clinical laboratories inpatient rehabilitation hospitals provide inpatient services for patients with intensive rehabilitation needs longterm acute care hospitals provide inpatient services for patients with complex medical conditions that require more intensive care monitoring or emergency support than is available in most skilled nursing facilities 

 

medical office buildings 

 

the medical office building portfolio consists of health care related buildings that include physician offices ambulatory surgery centers diagnostic facilities or labs our portfolio has a strong affiliation with health systems 

approximately 75 of the buildings are either located on campus or affiliated with hospitals through a satellite location 

 

investments 

 

we invest in senior housing and health care real estate we diversify our investment portfolio by property type operatortenant and geographic location in determining whether to invest in a property we focus on the following 1 the experience of the obligor’s management team 2 the historical and projected financial and operational performance of the property 3 the credit of the obligor 4 the security for the lease or loan and 5 the capital committed to the property by the obligor we conduct market research and analysis for all potential investments in addition we review the value of all properties the interest rates and covenant requirements of any debt to be assumed and the anticipated sources of repayment of any existing debt that is not to be assumed 

 

we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property our asset management process for investment properties generally includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each property periodic review of obligor creditworthiness periodic property inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure real estate taxes letters of credit and other collateral our internal property management division actively manages and monitors the medical office building portfolio with a comprehensive process including tenant relations tenant lease expirations the mix of health service providers hospitalhealth system relationships property performance capital improvement needs and market conditions among other things in monitoring our portfolio our personnel use a proprietary database to collect and analyze propertyspecific data additionally we conduct extensive research to ascertain industry trends and risks 

 

through asset management and research we evaluate the operating environment in each property’s market to determine whether payment risk is likely to increase when we identify unacceptable levels of payment risk we seek to mitigate eliminate or transfer the risk we categorize the risk as obligor property or market risk for obligor risk we typically find a substitute operatortenant to run the property for property risk we usually work with the operatortenant to institute propertylevel management changes to address the risk finally for market risk we often encourage an obligor to change its capital structure including refinancing the property or raising additional equity through these asset management and research efforts we are generally able to intervene at an early stage to address payment risk and in so doing support both the collectability of revenue and the value of our investment 

 

depending upon market conditions we believe that new investments will be available in the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to our stockholders 

 

segment reporting 

 

our business consists of two business segments — investment properties and medical office buildings for additional information regarding business segments see note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements

real property our investment properties are those in which we do not participate in the management of the property and are primarily land building improvements and related rights that are leased to operators under longterm operating leases the net value of our investment properties excluding construction in progress aggregated approximately 3795765000 at december 31 2009 the leases generally have a fixed contractual term of 12 to 15 years and contain one or more five to 15year renewal options most of our rents are received under triplenet leases requiring the operator to pay rent and all additional charges incurred in the operation of the leased property the tenants are required to repair rebuild and maintain the leased properties substantially all of these operating leases are designed with either fixed or contingent escalating rent structures leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straightline basis over the initial lease period subject to a collectability assessment rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period 

 

at december 31 2009 84 of our investment properties was subject to master leases a master lease is a lease of multiple properties to one tenant entity under a single lease agreement from time to time we may acquire 

additional properties that are then leased to the tenant under the master lease the tenant is required to make one monthly payment that represents rent on all the properties that are subject to the master lease typically the master lease tenant can exercise its right to purchase the properties or to renew the master lease only with respect to all leased properties at the same time this bundling feature benefits us because the tenant cannot limit the purchase or renewal to the better performing properties and terminate the leasing arrangement with respect to the poorer performing properties this spreads our risk among the entire group of properties within the master lease the bundling feature may provide a similar advantage if the master lease tenant is in bankruptcy subject to certain restrictions a debtor in bankruptcy has the right to assume or reject each of its leases it is our intent that a tenant in bankruptcy would be required to assume or reject the master lease as a whole rather than deciding on a property by property basis 

 

construction we currently provide for the construction of properties for tenants as part of longterm operating leases we capitalize certain interest costs associated with funds used to pay for the construction of properties owned by us the amount capitalized is based upon the amount advanced during the construction period using the rate of interest that approximates our cost of financing our interest expense is reduced by the amount capitalized we also typically charge a transaction fee at the commencement of construction which we defer and amortize to income over the term of the resulting lease the construction period commences upon funding and terminates upon the earlier of the completion of the applicable property or the end of a specified period during the construction period we advance funds to the tenants in accordance with agreed upon terms and conditions which require among other things periodic site visits by a company representative during the construction period we generally require an additional credit enhancement in the form of payment and performance bonds andor completion guaranties at december 31 2009 we had outstanding construction investments of 435334000 and were committed to providing additional funds of approximately 184848000 to complete construction for investment properties 

 

real estate loans our real estate loans are typically structured to provide us with interest income principal amortization and transaction fees and are generally secured by a first second or third mortgage lien leasehold mortgage corporate guaranties andor personal guaranties at december 31 2009 we had outstanding real estate loans of 427363000 the interest yield averaged approximately 796 per annum on our outstanding real estate loan balances our yield on real estate loans depends upon a number of factors including the stated interest rate average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments the real estate loans outstanding at december 31 2009 are generally subject to three to 20year terms with principal amortization schedules andor balloon payments of the outstanding principal balances at the end of the term typically real estate loans are crossdefaulted and crosscollateralized with other real estate loans operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its affiliates 

 

medical office buildings 

 

our medical office building portfolio is primarily selfmanaged and consists principally of multitenant properties leased to health care providers our leases have favorable lease terms that typically include fixed increasers and some form of operating expense reimbursement by the tenant as of december 31 2009 87 of our portfolio included leases with full pass thru 10 with a partial expense reimbursement modified gross and 3 with no expense reimbursement gross our medical office building leases are noncancellable operating leases that have a weighted average remaining term of six years at december 31 2009 and are normally credit enhanced by guaranties andor letters of credit the net value of our medical office buildings excluding construction in progress aggregated approximately 1405843000 at december 31 2009 we also had outstanding construction investments of 21498000 and expected to provide additional funds of approximately 29097000 to complete construction for medical office buildings 

 

development services group 

 

through our subsidiary hcn development services group inc “dsg” we provide services such as property development facility and medical equipment planning and implementation services to health care systems physician groups and third party medical property owners formerly known as hospital affiliates development corporation or “hadc” dsg develops and constructs new “buildtosuit” and multitenant facilities 

for us and in some instances for third parties who are expected to develop longterm relationships with the company 

 

equity investments 

 

equity investments at december 31 2009 and 2008 include an investment in a public company that has a readily determinable fair market value we classify this equity investment as availableforsale and accordingly record this investment at its fair market value with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income a separate component of stockholders’ equity equity investments at december 31 2009 and 2008 also include an investment in a private company we do not have the ability to exercise influence over the company so the investment is accounted for under the cost method under the cost method of accounting investments in private companies are carried at cost and are adjusted only for otherthantemporary declines in fair value return of capital and additional investments these equity investments represented a minimal ownership interest in these companies additionally equity investments at december 31 2009 include an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture 

 

investments in unconsolidated joint ventures investments in entities which we do not consolidate but for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are reported under the equity method of accounting under the equity method of accounting our share of the investee’s earnings or losses is included in our consolidated results of operations the initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is based on the amount paid to purchase the joint venture interest or the estimated fair value of the assets prior to the sale of interests in the joint venture we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the equity method investment to its carrying value when we determine a decline in the estimated fair value of such an investment below its carrying value is otherthantemporary an impairment is recorded 

 

borrowing policies 

 

we utilize a combination of debt and equity to fund the purchase of new properties and to provide loan financing our debt and equity levels are determined by management to maintain a conservative credit profile generally we intend to issue unsecured fixed rate public debt with longterm maturities to approximate the maturities on our leases and loans for shortterm purposes we may borrow on our unsecured line of credit arrangement we replace these borrowings with longterm capital such as senior unsecured notes common stock or preferred stock when terms are deemed favorable we may invest in properties subject to existing mortgage indebtedness in addition we may obtain secured financing for unleveraged properties in which we have invested or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis it is our intent to limit secured indebtedness in our agreements with our lenders we are subject to restrictions with respect to secured and unsecured indebtedness 

 

competition 

 

we compete with other real estate investment trusts real estate partnerships private equity and hedge fund investors banks insurance companies financeinvestment companies governmentsponsored agencies taxable and taxexempt bond funds health care operators developers and other investors in the acquisition development leasing and financing of health care and senior housing properties some of our competitors are larger with greater resources and lower costs of capital than us increased competition inhibits our ability to identify and successfully complete investments we compete for investments based on a number of factors including rates financings offered underwriting criteria and reputation our ability to successfully compete is also impacted by economic and population trends availability of acceptable investment opportunities our ability to negotiate beneficial investment terms availability and cost of capital construction and renovation costs and new and existing laws and regulations 

 

the operatorstenants of our properties compete on a local and regional basis with operatorstenants of properties that provide comparable services operatorstenants compete for patients and residents based on a number of factors including quality of care reputation physical appearance of properties services offered family preferences physicians staff and price we also face competition from other health care facilities for tenants such as physicians and other health care providers that provide comparable facilities and services

certain government regulations 

 

health law matters — generally 

 

typically operators of assisted living and independent living facilities do not receive significant funding from governmental programs and are regulated by the applicable state not the federal government operators of skilled nursing facilities and hospitals do receive significant funding from governmental programs and are subject to federal and state laws that regulate the type and quality of the medical andor nursing care provided ancillary services eg respiratory occupational physical and infusion therapies qualifications of the administrative personnel and nursing staff the adequacy of the physical plant and equipment reimbursement and rate setting and operating policies in addition as described below operators are subject to extensive laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including kickbacks physician selfreferrals and false claims hospitals physician group practice clinics and other health care providers that operate in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal state and local licensure certification and inspection laws and regulations our tenants’ failure to comply with any of these laws could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension or decertification or exclusion from federal and state health care programs loss of license or closure of the facility 

 

licensing and certification 

 

the primary regulations that affect assisted living facilities are state licensing laws in granting and renewing these licenses the regulatory authorities consider numerous factors relating to a property’s physical plant and operations including but not limited to admission and discharge standards and staffing and training a decision to grant or renew a license is also affected by a property’s record with respect to patient and consumer rights and medication guidelines and rules certain of the senior housing facilities mortgaged to or owned by us may require the resident to pay an entrance or upfront fee a portion of which may be refundable these entrance fee communities are subject to significant state regulatory oversight including for example oversight of each facility’s financial condition establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial restrictions the right of residents to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time lien rights in favor of residents restrictions on change of ownership and similar matters such oversight and the rights of residents within these 

entrance fee communities may have an effect on the revenue or operations of the operators of such facilities and therefore may adversely affect us 

 

skilled nursing facilities are subject to a variety of licensure and certificate of need “con” laws and regulations con laws in those states that have them generally require a facility to demonstrate the need for constructing a new facility adding beds or expanding an existing facility investing in major capital equipment or adding new services changing the ownership or control of an existing licensed facility or terminating services that have been previously approved through the con process the con laws and regulations may restrict the ability of operators to add new properties or expand an existing facility’s size or services in addition con laws may constrain the ability of an operator to transfer responsibility for operating a particular facility to a new operator if we have to replace a barred property operator as discussed below our ability to replace the operator may be affected by con rules and policies governing changes in control 

 

with respect to licensure generally our skilled nursing facilities and hospitals are required to be licensed and certified for participation in the medicare medicaid and other federal health care programs this generally requires license renewals and compliance surveys on an annual or biannual basis the failure of our operators to maintain or renew any required license or regulatory approval or the failure to correct serious survey deficiencies identified in compliance surveys could prevent them from continuing operations at a property in addition if a property is found out of compliance with the conditions of participation in medicare medicaid or other health care programs the property may be barred from participation in government reimbursement programs any of these occurrences may impair the ability of our operators to meet their obligations to us if we have to replace a barred property operator our ability to replace the operator may be affected by federal and state rules and policies governing changes in control this may result in payment delays an inability to find a replacement operator a significant working capital commitment from us to a new operator or other difficulties 

 

reimbursement 

 

assisted living facilities approximately 21 of our rental revenues for the year ended december 31 2009 were attributable to assisted living facilities the majority of the revenues received by the operators of our assisted living facilities are from private pay sources the remaining revenue source is primarily medicaid under certain waiver programs as a part of the omnibus budget reconciliation act “obra” of 1981 congress established a waiver program enabling some states to offer medicaid reimbursement to assisted living facilities as an alternative to institutional longterm care services the provisions of obra and the subsequent obra acts of 1987 and 1990 permit states to seek a waiver from typical medicaid requirements to develop costeffective alternatives to longterm care including medicaid payments for assisted living and home health at december 31 2009 four of our 22 assisted living operators received medicaid reimbursement pursuant to medicaid waiver programs for the twelve months ended september 30 2009 approximately 9 of the revenues at our assisted living facilities were from medicaid reimbursement there can be no guarantee that a state medicaid program operating pursuant to a waiver will be able to maintain its waiver status 

 

rates paid by selfpay residents are set by the facilities and are largely determined by local market conditions and operating costs generally facilities receive a higher payment per day for a private pay resident than for a medicaid beneficiary who requires a comparable level of care the level of medicaid reimbursement varies from state to state thus the revenues generated by operators of our assisted living facilities may be adversely affected by payor mix acuity level and changes in medicaid eligibility and reimbursement levels in addition a state could lose its medicaid waiver and no longer be permitted to utilize medicaid dollars to reimburse for assisted living services changes in revenues could in turn have a material adverse effect on an operator’s ability to meet its obligations to us 

 

skilled nursing facilities and hospitals skilled nursing facilities and hospitals typically receive most of their revenues from medicare and medicaid with the balance representing private pay including private insurance consequently changes in federal or state reimbursement policies may also adversely affect an operator’s ability to cover its expenses including our rent or debt service skilled nursing facilities and hospitals are subject to periodic pre and postpayment reviews and other audits by federal and state authorities a review or audit of claims of a property operator could result in recoupments denials or delays of payments in the future which could have a material adverse effect on the operator’s ability to meet its obligations to us due to the significant judgments and 

estimates inherent in payor settlement accounting no assurance can be given as to the adequacy of any reserves maintained by our property operators for potential adjustments to reimbursements for payor settlements due to budgetary constraints governmental payors may limit or reduce payments to skilled nursing facilities and hospitals as a result of government reimbursement programs being subject to such budgetary pressures and legislative and administrative actions an operator’s ability to meet its obligations to us may be significantly impaired 

 

medicare reimbursement and skilled nursing facilities for the twelve months ended september 30 2009 approximately 30 of the revenues at our skilled nursing facilities which comprised 31 of our rental revenues for the year ended december 31 2009 were from medicare reimbursement skilled nursing facilities are reimbursed under the skilled nursing facility prospective payment system this type of reimbursement program puts facilities at risk to the extent that their costs exceed the fixed payments under the prospective payment system in addition there is a risk that payments under the prospective payment system may be set too low which could result in immediate financial difficulties for skilled nursing facilities and cause operators to seek bankruptcy protection skilled nursing facilities have had these types of difficulties since the implementation of the prospective payment system 

 

skilled nursing facilities received a full medicare market basket update of 34 for federal fiscal year 2009 the centers for medicare  medicaid services “cms” an agency of the us department of health and human services has announced that skilled nursing facilities will receive an additional 11 net decrease in medicare payments for fiscal year 2010 this 11 net decrease is the result of a 33 decrease in payments due to recalibration of the casemix indexes combined with a 22 increase in payments through “market basket” changes for fiscal year 2010 section 5008 of the deficit reduction act of 2005 directs the secretary as defined in that statute to conduct a demonstration program beginning january 1 2008 assessing the costs and outcomes of patients discharged from hospitals in a variety of postacute care settings including skilled nursing facilities the outcome of that demonstration program could lead to changes in medicare coverage and reimbursement for postacute care it is not known how either the demonstration program or any other changes in medicare reimbursement or regulatory obligations that might be proposed might impact tenants of the company’s properties 

 

the balanced budget act of 1997 mandated caps on medicare reimbursement for certain therapy services however congress imposed various moratoriums on the implementation of those caps for 2010 the annual payment cap of 1860 per patient applies to occupational therapy and a separate 1860 cap applies to speech and physical therapy congress has permitted patients exceeding the cap to obtain additional medicare coverage through a waiver program if the therapy is deemed medically necessary the waiver program was historically extended most recently by the medicare improvements for patients and providers act of 2008 through december 31 2009 health care reform bills considered by congress in 2009 would have extended this waiver program through at least 2010 but due to congressional inactivity these provisions were not passed before the waiver expired on december 31 2009 patients will therefore need to use private funds to pay for the cost of therapy above the caps if patients are unable to satisfy their outofpocket cost responsibility to reimburse an operator for services rendered the operator’s ability to meet its obligations to us could be adversely impacted 

 

medicare reimbursement and hospitals for the twelve months ended september 30 2009 approximately 53 of the revenues at our hospitals which comprised 8 of our rental revenues for the year ended december 31 2009 were from medicare hospitals generally are reimbursed by medicare under the diagnosis related group prospective payment system reimbursement methodology for inpatient hospitals the longterm acute care hospital prospective payment system for longterm acute care hospitals or the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system acute care hospitals provide a wide range of inpatient and outpatient services including but not limited to surgery rehabilitation therapy and clinical laboratories longterm acute care hospitals provide inpatient services for patients with complex medical conditions that require more intensive care monitoring or emergency support than that available in most skilled nursing facilities inpatient rehabilitation facilities provide intensive rehabilitation services in an inpatient setting for patients requiring at least three hours of rehabilitation services a day 

 

with respect to medicare’s diagnosis related groupoutpatient prospective payment system methodology for regular hospitals reimbursement for inpatient services is made on the basis of a fixed prospective rate based on the principal diagnosis of the patient hospitals are at risk to the extent that their costs in treating a specific case exceed the fixed payment the diagnosis related group reimbursement system was changed in 2008 with the expansion of 

diagnosis groups from 538 to 745 diagnosis related groups to greater reflect severity one additional diagnosis related group was added in 2009 for a new total of 746 it is possible that this change in the drg system will adversely impact reimbursement for some of our hospitals in some cases a hospital might be able to qualify for an outlier payment if the hospital’s losses exceed a threshold 

 

medicaid reimbursement medicaid is a major payor source for residents in our skilled nursing facilities and hospitals for the twelve months ended september 30 2009 approximately 50 of the revenues of our skilled nursing facilities and 3 of the revenues of our hospitals were attributable to medicaid payments the federal government and the states share responsibility for financing medicaid the federal matching rate known as the federal medical assistance percentage varies by state based on relative per capita income but is at least 50 in all states on average medicaid is the largest component of total state spending representing approximately 21 of total state spending the percentage of medicaid dollars used for longterm care varies from state to state due in part to different ratios of elderly population and eligibility requirements within certain federal guidelines states have a wide range of discretion to determine eligibility and reimbursement methodology many states reimburse longterm care facilities using fixed daily rates which are applied prospectively based on patient acuity and the historical costs incurred in providing patient care reasonable costs typically include allowances for staffing administrative and general and property and equipment eg real estate taxes depreciation and fair rental 

 

in most states medicaid does not fully reimburse the cost of providing skilled nursing services certain states are attempting to slow the rate of growth in medicaid expenditures by freezing rates or restricting eligibility and benefits at the beginning of state fiscal year 2010 states in which we have skilled nursing property investments held rates flat on average for fiscal year 2010 our skilled nursing portfolio’s average medicaid rate will likely vary throughout the year as states continue to make interim changes to their budgets and medicaid funding in addition medicaid rates may decline if revenues in a particular state are not sufficient to fund budgeted expenditures 

 

the medicare part d drug benefit became effective january 1 2006 nursing home residents dually eligible for medicare and enrolled in one of the new part d plans and medicaid may now enroll and receive reimbursement for drugs through medicare part d rather than through medicaid part d will result in increased administrative responsibilities for nursing home operators because enrollment in part d is voluntary and residents have the choice of multiple prescription drug plans operators may also experience increased expenses to the extent that patients’ specific prescribed drugs may not be on the part d drug plan formulary for the plan in which specific patients are enrolled 

 

the reimbursement methodologies applied to health care facilities continue to evolve federal and state authorities have considered and may seek to implement new or modified reimbursement methodologies that may negatively impact health care property operations the impact of any such change if implemented may result in a material adverse effect on our skilled nursing and hospital property operations no assurance can be given that current revenue sources or levels will be maintained accordingly there can be no assurance that payments under a government reimbursement program are currently or will be in the future sufficient to fully reimburse the property operators for their operating and capital expenses as a result an operator’s ability to meet its obligations to us could be adversely impacted 

 

finally federal legislative efforts to reform the health care industry may have a significant impact on medicare medicaid and private insurance coverage and reimbursement for services provided by skilled nursing facilities and other health care providers any such health care reform could have a substantial and material adverse effect on all parties directly or indirectly involved in the health care system 

 

other related laws 

 

skilled nursing facilities and hospitals and assisted living or ccrc facilities that receive medicaid payments are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations that govern the operations and financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by health care providers certain of these laws prohibit direct or indirect payments of any kind for the purpose of inducing or encouraging the referral of patients for medical products or services reimbursable by governmental programs other laws require providers to furnish only medically necessary services and submit to the government valid and accurate statements for each service still other laws require providers to comply with a variety of safety health and other requirements relating to the condition of the licensed 

property and the quality of care provided sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations may include but are not limited to criminal andor civil penalties and fines and a loss of licensure immediate termination of governmental payments and exclusion from eligibility for any governmental reimbursement in certain circumstances violation of these rules such as those prohibiting abusive and fraudulent behavior with respect to one property may subject other facilities under common control or ownership to sanctions including exclusion from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs in the ordinary course of its business a property operator is regularly subjected to inquiries investigations and audits by federal and state agencies that oversee these laws and regulations 

 

each skilled nursing and hospital property and any assisted living or ccrc property that receives medicaid payments is subject to the federal antikickback statute that generally prohibits persons from offering providing soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing of a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal health care program such as the medicare and medicaid programs skilled nursing facilities and hospitals are also subject to the federal ethics in patient referral act of 1989 commonly referred to as the stark law the stark law generally prohibits the submission of claims to medicare for payment if the claim results from a physician referral for certain designated services and the physician has a financial relationship with the health service provider that does not qualify under one of the exceptions for a financial relationship under the stark law similar prohibitions on physician selfreferrals and submission of claims apply to state medicaid programs further skilled nursing facilities and hospitals and assisted living or ccrc facilities that receive medicaid payments are subject to substantial financial penalties under the civil monetary penalties act and the false claims act and in particular actions under the false claims act’s “whistleblower” provisions private enforcement of health care fraud has increased due in large part to amendments to the false claims act that encourage private individuals to sue on behalf of the government these whistleblower suits by private individuals known as qui tam actions may be filed by almost anyone including present and former patients nurses and other employees some cases have been brought under the federal false claims act asserting claims for treble damages and up to 11000 per claim on the basis of the alleged failure of a nursing facility to meet applicable regulations relating to the operation of the nursing facility prosecutions investigations or whistleblower actions could have a material adverse effect on a property operator’s liquidity financial condition and results of operations which could adversely affect the ability of the operator to meet its obligations to us finally various state false claim and antikickback laws also may apply to each property operator violation of any of the foregoing statutes can result in criminal andor civil penalties that could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its obligations to us 

 

other legislative developments over the past several years including the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” have greatly expanded the definition of health care fraud and related offenses and broadened its scope to include private health care plans in addition to government payors congress also has greatly increased funding for the department of justice federal bureau of investigation and the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services to audit investigate and prosecute suspected health care fraud moreover a significant portion of the billions in health care fraud recoveries over the past several years has also been returned to government agencies to further fund their fraud investigation and prosecution efforts 

 

additionally other hipaa provisions and regulations provide for communication of health information through standard electronic transaction formats and for the privacy and security of health information in order to comply with the regulations health care providers must undergo significant operational and technical changes operators also face significant financial exposure if they fail to maintain the privacy and security of medical records and personal identifiable health information about individuals the health information technology for economic and clinical health “hitech” act passed in february 2009 modified the secretary of health and human services’ authority to impose civil money penalties for hipaa violations occurring after february 18 2009 hitech directs the hhs secretary to provide for periodic audits to ensure covered entities and their business associates as that term is defined under hipaa comply with applicable hitech requirements increasing the likelihood that a hipaa violation will result in an enforcement action cms issued an interim final rule effective november 2009 which conforms hipaa enforcement regulations to the hitech act increasing the maximum penalty to 15 million for certain types of violations 

in november 2002 cms began a national nursing home quality initiative nhqi under this initiative historical survey information the nhqi pilot evaluation report and the nhqi overview is made available to the public online the nhqi website provides consumer and provider information regarding the quality of care in nursing homes the data allows consumers providers states and researchers to compare quality information that shows how well nursing homes are caring for their residents’ physical and clinical needs the posted nursing home quality measures come from resident assessment data that nursing homes routinely collect on the residents at specified intervals during their stay if the operators of nursing facilities are unable to achieve quality of care ratings that are comparable or superior to those of their competitors they may lose market share to other facilities reducing their revenues and adversely impacting their ability to make rental payments 

 

finally government investigation and enforcement of health care laws has increased dramatically over the past several years and is expected to continue some of these enforcement actions represent novel legal theories and expansions in the application of false claims laws the costs for an operator of a health care property associated with both defending such enforcement actions and the undertakings in settlement agreements can be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its obligations to us 

 

environmental laws 

 

a wide variety of federal state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect health care facility operations or special medical properties under various federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations an owner of real property or a secured lender such as the company may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at under or disposed of in connection with such property as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property the cost of any required remediation removal fines or personal or property damages and the owner’s or secured lender’s liability for such costs could exceed the value of the property andor the assets of the owner or secured lender in addition the presence of such substances or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which in turn would reduce revenues

general 

 

we elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust a “reit” commencing with our first taxable year we intend to continue to operate in such a manner as to qualify as a reit but there is no guarantee that we will qualify or remain qualified as a reit for subsequent years qualification and taxation as a reit depends upon our ability to 

meet a variety of qualification tests imposed under federal income tax law with respect to income assets distribution level and diversity of share ownership as discussed below under “— qualification as a reit” there can be no assurance that we will be owned and organized and will operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified 

 

in any year in which we qualify as a reit in general we will not be subject to federal income tax on that portion of our reit taxable income or capital gain that is distributed to stockholders we may however be subject to tax at normal corporate rates on any taxable income or capital gain not distributed if we elect to retain and pay income tax on our net longterm capital gain stockholders are required to include their proportionate share of our undistributed longterm capital gain in income but they will receive a refundable credit for their share of any taxes paid by us on such gain 

 

despite the reit election we may be subject to federal income and excise tax as follows 

 

  

if we acquire any assets from a corporation which is or has been a “c” corporation in a carryover basis transaction we could be liable for specified liabilities that are inherited from the “c” corporation a “c” corporation is generally defined as a corporation that is required to pay full corporate level federal income tax if we recognize gain on the disposition of the assets during the tenyear period beginning on the date on which the assets were acquired by us then to the extent of the assets’ “builtin gain” ie the excess of the fair market value of the asset over the adjusted tax basis in the asset in each case determined as of the beginning of the tenyear period we will be subject to tax on the gain at the highest regular corporate rate applicable the results described in this paragraph with respect to the recognition of builtin gain assume that the builtin gain assets at the time the builtin gain assets were subject to a conversion transaction either where a “c” corporation elected reit status or a reit acquired the assets from a “c” corporation were not treated as sold to an unrelated party and gain recognized 

qualification as a reit 

 

a reit is defined as a corporation trust or association 

 

  

conditions 1 to 4 inclusive must be met during the entire taxable year and condition 5 must be met during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months for purposes of conditions 5 and 6 pension funds and certain other taxexempt entities are treated as individuals subject to a “lookthrough” exception in the case of condition 6 

 

based on publicly available information we believe we have satisfied the share ownership requirements set forth in 5 and 6 above in addition article vi of our amended and restated bylaws provides for restrictions regarding ownership and transfer of shares these restrictions are intended to assist us in continuing to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in 5 and 6 above these restrictions however may not ensure that we will in all cases be able to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in 5 and 6 above 

 

we have complied with and will continue to comply with regulatory rules to send annual letters to certain of our stockholders requesting information regarding the actual ownership of our stock if despite sending the annual letters we do not know or after exercising reasonable diligence would not have known whether we failed to meet the five or fewer requirement we will be treated as having met the five or fewer requirement if we fail to comply with these regulatory rules we will be subject to a monetary penalty if our failure to comply was due to intentional disregard of the requirement the penalty would be increased however if our failure to comply were due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect no penalty would be imposed 

 

we may own a number of properties through wholly owned subsidiaries a corporation will qualify as a “qualified reit subsidiary” if 100 of its stock is owned by a reit and the reit does not elect to treat the subsidiary as a taxable reit subsidiary a “qualified reit subsidiary” will not be treated as a separate corporation and all assets liabilities and items of income deductions and credits of a “qualified reit subsidiary” will be treated as assets liabilities and items as the case may be of the reit a “qualified reit subsidiary” is not subject to federal income tax and our ownership of the voting stock of a qualified reit subsidiary will not violate the restrictions against ownership of securities of any one issuer which constitute more than 10 of the value or total voting power of such issuer or more than 5 of the value of our total assets as described below under “— asset tests” 

 

if we invest in a partnership a limited liability company or a trust taxed as a partnership or as a disregarded entity we will be deemed to own a proportionate share of the partnership’s limited liability company’s or trust’s assets likewise we will be treated as receiving our share of the income and loss of the partnership limited liability company or trust and the gross income will retain the same character in our hands as it has in the hands of the 

partnership limited liability company or trust these “lookthrough” rules apply for purposes of the income tests and assets tests described below 

 

income tests there are two separate percentage tests relating to our sources of gross income that we must satisfy for each taxable year 

 

  

for taxable years beginning on or before october 22 2004 1 payments to us under an interest rate swap or cap agreement option futures contract forward rate agreement or any similar financial instrument entered into by us to reduce interest rate risk on indebtedness incurred or to be incurred and 2 gain from the sale or other disposition of any such investment are treated as income qualifying under the 95 gross income test as to transactions entered into in taxable years beginning after october 22 2004 any of our income from a “clearly identified” hedging transaction that is entered into by us in the normal course of business directly or indirectly to manage the risk of interest rate movements price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings or obligations incurred or to be incurred by us or such other risks that are prescribed by the internal revenue service is excluded from the 95 gross income test 

 

for transactions entered into after july 30 2008 any of our income from a “clearly identified” hedging transaction that is entered into by us in the normal course of business directly or indirectly to manage the risk of interest rate movements price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings or obligations incurred or to be incurred by us is excluded from the 95 and 75 gross income tests 

 

for transactions entered into after july 30 2008 any of our income from a “clearly identified” hedging transaction entered into by us primarily to manage risk of currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain that is included in gross income in the 95 and 75 gross income tests is excluded from the 95 and 75 gross income tests 

 

in general a hedging transaction is “clearly identified” if 1 the transaction is identified as a hedging transaction before the end of the day on which it is entered into and 2 the items or risks being hedged are identified “substantially contemporaneously” with the hedging transaction an identification is not substantially contemporaneous if it is made more than 35 days after entering into the hedging transaction 

 

as to gains and items of income recognized after july 30 2008 “passive foreign exchange gain” for any taxable year will not constitute gross income for purposes of the 95 gross income test and “real estate foreign exchange gain” for any taxable year will not constitute gross income for purposes of the 75 gross income test real estate foreign exchange gain is foreign currency gain as defined in internal revenue code section 988b1 which is attributable to i any qualifying item of income or gain for purposes of the 75 gross income test ii the acquisition or ownership of obligations secured by mortgages on real property or interests in real property or iii becoming or being the obligor under obligations secured by mortgages on real property or on interests in real property real estate foreign exchange gain also includes internal revenue code section 987 gain attributable to a qualified business unit a “qbu” of a reit if the qbu itself meets the 75 income test for the taxable year and the 75 asset test at the close of each quarter that the reit has directly or indirectly held the qbu real estate foreign exchange gain also includes any other foreign currency gain as determined by the secretary of the treasury passive foreign exchange gain includes all real estate foreign exchange gain and foreign currency gain which is attributable to i any qualifying item of income or gain for purposes of the 95 gross income test ii the acquisition or ownership of obligations iii becoming or being the obligor under obligations and iv any other foreign currency gain as determined by the secretary of the treasury 

generally other than income from “clearly identified” hedging transactions entered into by us in the normal course of business any foreign currency gain derived by us from dealing or engaging in substantial and regular trading in securities will constitute gross income which does not qualify under the 95 or 75 gross income tests 

 

rents received by us will qualify as “rents from real property” for purposes of satisfying the gross income tests for a reit only if several conditions are met 

 

  

for taxable years beginning after august 5 1997 a reit has been permitted to render a de minimis amount of impermissible services to tenants and still treat amounts received with respect to that property as rent from real property the amount received or accrued by the reit during the taxable year for the impermissible services with respect to a property may not exceed 1 of all amounts received or accrued by the reit directly or indirectly from the property the amount received for any service or management operation for this purpose shall be deemed to be not less than 150 of the direct cost of the reit in furnishing or rendering the service or providing the management or operation furthermore impermissible services may be furnished to tenants by a taxable reit subsidiary subject to certain conditions and we may still treat rents received with respect to the property as rent from real property 

 

the term “interest” generally does not include any amount if the determination of the amount depends in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person although an amount generally will not be excluded from the term “interest” solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage of receipts or sales 

 

if we fail to satisfy one or both of the 75 or 95 gross income tests for any taxable year we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for such year if we are eligible for relief for taxable years beginning on or before october 22 2004 these relief provisions generally will be available if 1 our failure to meet such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect 2 we attach a schedule of the sources of our income to our return and 3 any incorrect information on the schedule was not due to fraud with intent to evade tax for taxable years beginning after october 22 2004 these relief provisions generally will be available if 1 following our identification of the failure we file a schedule for such taxable year describing each item of our gross income and 2 the failure to meet such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect 

 

it is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions if these relief provisions apply a 100 tax is imposed on an amount equal to a the gross income attributable to 1 75 of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75 income test and 2 95 of our gross income 90 of our gross income for taxable years beginning on or before 

october 22 2004 over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 95 income test multiplied by b a fraction intended to reflect our profitability 

 

the secretary of the treasury is given broad authority to determine whether particular items of income or gain qualify or not under the 75 and 95 gross income tests or are to be excluded from the measure of gross income for such purposes 

 

asset tests within 30 days after the close of each quarter of our taxable year we must also satisfy several tests relating to the nature and diversification of our assets determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles at least 75 of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets cash cash items including receivables arising in the ordinary course of our operation government securities and qualified temporary investments although the remaining 25 of our assets generally may be invested without restriction we are prohibited from owning securities representing more than 10 of either the vote the “10 vote test” or value the “10 value test” of the outstanding securities of any issuer other than a qualified reit subsidiary another reit or a taxable reit subsidiary further no more than 25 of the total assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries the “25 asset test” and no more than 5 of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities of any nongovernmental issuer other than a qualified reit subsidiary the “5 asset test” another reit or a taxable reit subsidiary each of the 10 vote test the 10 value test and the 25 and 5 asset tests must be satisfied at the end of each quarter there are special rules which provide relief if the value related tests are not satisfied due to changes in the value of the assets of a reit 

 

for taxable years beginning after december 31 2000 certain items are excluded from the 10 value test including 1 straight debt securities of an issuer including straight debt that provides certain contingent payments 2 any loan to an individual or an estate 3 any rental agreement described in section 467 of the internal revenue code other than with a “related person” 4 any obligation to pay rents from real property 5 certain securities issued by a state or any subdivision thereof the district of columbia a foreign government or any political subdivision thereof or the commonwealth of puerto rico 6 any security issued by a reit and 7 any other arrangement that as determined by the secretary of the treasury is excepted from the definition of security “excluded securities” special rules apply to straight debt securities issued by corporations and entities taxable as partnerships for federal income tax purposes if a reit or its taxable reit subsidiary holds 1 straight debt securities of a corporate or partnership issuer and 2 securities of such issuer that are not excluded securities and have an aggregate value greater than 1 of such issuer’s outstanding securities the straight debt securities will be included in the 10 value test 

 

for taxable years beginning after december 31 2000 a reit’s interest as a partner in a partnership is not treated as a security for purposes of applying the 10 value test to securities issued by the partnership further any debt instrument issued by a partnership will not be a security for purposes of applying the 10 value test 1 to the extent of the reit’s interest as a partner in the partnership and 2 if at least 75 of the partnership’s gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions would qualify for the 75 gross income test for taxable years beginning after october 22 2004 for purposes of the 10 value test a reit’s interest in a partnership’s assets is determined by the reit’s proportionate interest in any securities issued by the partnership other than the excluded securities described in the preceding paragraph 

 

for taxable years beginning after july 30 2008 if the reit or its qbu uses a foreign currency as its functional currency the term “cash” includes such foreign currency but only to the extent such foreign currency is i held for use in the normal course of the activities of the reit or qbu which give rise to items of income or gain that are included in the 95 and 75 gross income tests or are directly related to acquiring or holding assets qualifying under the 75 asset test and ii not held in connection with dealing or engaging in substantial and regular trading in securities 

 

with respect to corrections of failures for which the requirements for corrections are satisfied after october 22 2004 regardless of whether such failures occurred in taxable years beginning on before or after such date as to violations of the 10 vote test the 10 value test or the 5 asset test a reit may avoid disqualification as a reit by disposing of sufficient assets to cure a violation that does not exceed the lesser of 1 of the reit’s assets at the end of the relevant quarter or 10000000 provided that the disposition occurs within six months following the last day of the quarter in which the reit first identified the assets for violations of any of the reit asset tests due to 

reasonable cause and not willful neglect that exceed the thresholds described in the preceding sentence a reit can avoid disqualification as a reit after the close of a taxable quarter by taking certain steps including disposition of sufficient assets within the six month period described above to meet the applicable asset test paying a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets during the period of time that the assets were held as nonqualifying assets and filing a schedule with the internal revenue service that describes the nonqualifying assets 

 

investments in taxable reit subsidiaries for taxable years beginning after december 31 2000 reits may own more than 10 of the voting power and value of securities in taxable reit subsidiaries we and any taxable corporate entity in which we own an interest are allowed to jointly elect to treat such entity as a “taxable reit subsidiary” 

 

certain of our subsidiaries have elected to be treated as a taxable reit subsidiary taxable reit subsidiaries are subject to full corporate level federal taxation on their earnings but are permitted to engage in certain types of activities that cannot be performed directly by reits without jeopardizing their reit status our taxable reit subsidiaries will attempt to minimize the amount of these taxes but there can be no assurance whether or the extent to which measures taken to minimize taxes will be successful to the extent our taxable reit subsidiaries are required to pay federal state or local taxes the cash available for distribution as dividends to us from our taxable reit subsidiaries will be reduced 

 

the amount of interest on relatedparty debt that a taxable reit subsidiary may deduct is limited further a 100 tax applies to any interest payments by a taxable reit subsidiary to its affiliated reit to the extent the interest rate is not commercially reasonable a taxable reit subsidiary is permitted to deduct interest payments to unrelated parties without any of these restrictions 

 

the internal revenue service may reallocate costs between a reit and its taxable reit subsidiary where there is a lack of arm’slength dealing between the parties any deductible expenses allocated away from a taxable reit subsidiary would increase its tax liability further any amount by which a reit understates its deductions and overstates those of its taxable reit subsidiary will subject to certain exceptions be subject to a 100 tax additional taxable reit subsidiary elections may be made in the future for additional entities in which we own an interest 

 

annual distribution requirements in order to avoid being taxed as a regular corporation we are required to make distributions other than capital gain distributions to our stockholders which qualify for the dividends paid deduction in an amount at least equal to 1 the sum of i 90 of our “reit taxable income” computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain and ii 90 of the aftertax net income if any from foreclosure property minus 2 a portion of certain items of noncash income these distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for that year and if paid on or before the first regular distribution payment after such declaration the amount distributed must not be preferential this means that every stockholder of the class of stock to which a distribution is made must be treated the same as every other stockholder of that class and no class of stock may be treated otherwise than in accordance with its dividend rights as a class to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our “reit taxable income” as adjusted we will be subject to tax on the undistributed amount at regular corporate tax rates finally as discussed above we may be subject to an excise tax if we fail to meet certain other distribution requirements we intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy these annual distribution requirements 

 

it is possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90 distribution requirement or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation due to among other things 1 timing differences between i the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses and ii the inclusion of income and deduction of expenses in arriving at our taxable income or 2 the payment of severance benefits that may not be deductible to us in the event that timing differences occur we may find it necessary to arrange for borrowings or if possible pay dividends in the form of taxable stock dividends in order to meet the distribution requirement 

under certain circumstances in the event of a deficiency determined by the internal revenue service we may be able to rectify a resulting failure to meet the distribution requirement for a year by paying “deficiency dividends” to stockholders in a later year which may be included in our deduction for distributions paid for the earlier year thus we may be able to avoid being taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends however we will be required to pay applicable penalties and interest based upon the amount of any deduction taken for deficiency dividend distributions 

 

the internal revenue service issued revenue procedure 200868 which provided temporary relief to publicly traded reits seeking to preserve liquidity by electing cashstock dividends under revenue procedure 200868 a reit may treat the entire dividend including the stock portion as a taxable dividend distribution thereby qualifying for the dividendspaid deduction provided certain requirements are satisfied the cash portion of the dividend may be as low as 10 the revenue procedure as amplified by revenue procedure 201012 applies to dividends declared on or before december 31 2012 and with respect to a taxable year ending on or before december 31 2011 

 

failure to qualify as a reit 

 

if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates distributions to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify as a reit will not be deductible nor will any particular amount of distributions be required to be made in any year all distributions to stockholders will be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these distributions and subject to certain limitations will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporate stockholders unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions we also will be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to statutory relief failure to qualify for even one year could result in our need to incur indebtedness or liquidate investments in order to pay potentially significant resulting tax liabilities 

 

in addition to the relief described above under “— income tests” and “— asset tests” relief is available in the event that we violate a provision of the internal revenue code that would result in our failure to qualify as a reit if 1 the violation is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect 2 we pay a penalty of 50000 for each failure to satisfy the provision and 3 the violation does not include a violation described under “— income tests” or “— asset tests” above it is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions 

 

federal income taxation of holders of our stock 

 

treatment of taxable us stockholders the following summary applies to you only if you are a “us stockholder” a “us stockholder” is a holder of shares of stock who for united states federal income tax purposes is 

 

  

so long as we qualify for taxation as a reit distributions on shares of our stock made out of the current or accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these distributions and not designated as capital gain dividends will be includable as ordinary income for federal income tax purposes none of these distributions will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for us corporate stockholders 

generally for taxable years ending after may 6 2003 through december 31 2010 the maximum marginal rate of tax payable by individuals on dividends received from corporations that are subject to a corporate level of tax is 15 except in limited circumstances this tax rate will not apply to dividends paid to you by us on our shares because generally we are not subject to federal income tax on the portion of our reit taxable income or capital gains distributed to our stockholders the reduced maximum federal income tax rate will apply to that portion if any of dividends received by you with respect to our shares that are attributable to 1 dividends received by us from nonreit corporations or other taxable reit subsidiaries 2 income from the prior year with respect to which we were required to pay federal corporate income tax during the prior year if for example we did not distribute 100 of our reit taxable income for the prior year or 3 the amount of any earnings and profits that were distributed by us and accumulated in a nonreit year 

 

distributions that are designated as capital gain dividends will be taxed as longterm capital gains to the extent they do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year without regard to the period for which you held our stock however if you are a corporation you may be required to treat a portion of some capital gain dividends as ordinary income 

 

if we elect to retain and pay income tax on any net longterm capital gain you would include in income as longterm capital gain your proportionate share of this net longterm capital gain you would also receive a refundable tax credit for your proportionate share of the tax paid by us on such retained capital gains and you would have an increase in the basis of your shares of our stock in an amount equal to your includable capital gains less your share of the tax deemed paid 

 

you may not include in your federal income tax return any of our net operating losses or capital losses federal income tax rules may also require that certain minimum tax adjustments and preferences be apportioned to you in addition any distribution declared by us in october november or december of any year on a specified date in any such month shall be treated as both paid by us and received by you on december 31 of that year provided that the distribution is actually paid by us no later than january 31 of the following year 

 

we will be treated as having sufficient earnings and profits to treat as a dividend any distribution up to the amount required to be distributed in order to avoid imposition of the 4 excise tax discussed under “— general” and “— qualification as a reit — annual distribution requirements” above as a result you may be required to treat as taxable dividends certain distributions that would otherwise result in a taxfree return of capital moreover any “deficiency dividend” will be treated as a dividend an ordinary dividend or a capital gain dividend as the case may be regardless of our earnings and profits any other distributions in excess of current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to you to the extent these distributions do not exceed the adjusted tax basis of your shares of our stock you will be required to reduce the tax basis of your shares of our stock by the amount of these distributions until the basis has been reduced to zero after which these distributions will be taxable as capital gain if the shares of our stock are held as capital assets the tax basis as so reduced will be used in computing the capital gain or loss if any realized upon sale of the shares of our stock any loss upon a sale or exchange of shares of our stock which were held for six months or less after application of certain holding period rules will generally be treated as a longterm capital loss to the extent you previously received capital gain distributions with respect to these shares of our stock 

 

upon the sale or exchange of any shares of our stock to or with a person other than us or a sale or exchange of all shares of our stock whether actually or constructively owned with us you will generally recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your adjusted tax basis in these shares of our stock this gain will be capital gain if you held these shares of our stock as a capital asset 

 

if we redeem any of your shares in us the treatment can only be determined on the basis of particular facts at the time of redemption in general you will recognize gain or loss as opposed to dividend income equal to the difference between the amount received by you in the redemption and your adjusted tax basis in your shares redeemed if such redemption 1 results in a “complete termination” of your interest in all classes of our equity securities 2 is a “substantially disproportionate redemption” or 3 is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” with respect to you in applying these tests you must take into account your ownership of all classes of our equity securities eg common stock preferred stock depositary shares and warrants you also must take into account any equity securities that are considered to be constructively owned by you 

if as a result of a redemption by us of your shares you no longer own either actually or constructively any of our equity securities or only own actually and constructively an insubstantial percentage of our equity securities then it is probable that the redemption of your shares would be considered “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” and thus would result in gain or loss to you however whether a distribution is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” depends on all of the facts and circumstances and if you rely on any of these tests at the time of redemption you should consult your tax advisor to determine their application to the particular situation 

 

generally if the redemption does not meet the tests described above then the proceeds received by you from the redemption of your shares will be treated as a distribution taxable as a dividend to the extent of the allocable portion of current or accumulated earnings and profits if the redemption is taxed as a dividend your adjusted tax basis in the redeemed shares will be transferred to any other shareholdings in us that you own if you own no other shareholdings in us under certain circumstances such basis may be transferred to a related person or it may be lost entirely 

 

gain from the sale or exchange of our shares held for more than one year is taxed at a maximum longterm capital gain rate which is currently 15 pursuant to internal revenue service guidance we may classify portions of our capital gain dividends as gains eligible for the longterm capital gains rate or as gain taxable to individual stockholders at a maximum rate of 25 

 

treatment of taxexempt us stockholders taxexempt entities including qualified employee pension and profit sharing trusts and individual retirement accounts “exempt organizations” generally are exempt from federal income taxation however they are subject to taxation on their unrelated business taxable income “ubti” the internal revenue service has issued a published revenue ruling that dividend distributions from a reit to an exempt employee pension trust do not constitute ubti provided that the shares of the reit are not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business of the exempt employee pension trust based on this ruling amounts distributed by us to exempt organizations generally should not constitute ubti however if an exempt organization finances its acquisition of the shares of our stock with debt a portion of its income from us will constitute ubti pursuant to the “debt financed property” rules likewise a portion of the exempt organization’s income from us would constitute ubti if we held a residual interest in a real estate mortgage investment conduit 

 

in addition in certain circumstances a pension trust that owns more than 10 of our stock is required to treat a percentage of our dividends as ubti this rule applies to a pension trust holding more than 10 of our stock only if 1 the percentage of our income that is ubti determined as if we were a pension trust is at least 5 2 we qualify as a reit by reason of the modification of the five or fewer requirement that allows beneficiaries of the pension trust to be treated as holding shares in proportion to their actuarial interests in the pension trust and 3 either i one pension trust owns more than 25 of the value of our stock or ii a group of pension trusts individually holding more than 10 of the value of our stock collectively own more than 50 of the value of our stock 

 

backup withholding and information reporting under certain circumstances you may be subject to backup withholding at applicable rates on payments made with respect to or cash proceeds of a sale or exchange of shares of our stock backup withholding will apply only if you 1 fail to provide a correct taxpayer identification number which if you are an individual is ordinarily your social security number 2 furnish an incorrect taxpayer identification number 3 are notified by the internal revenue service that you have failed to properly report payments of interest or dividends or 4 fail to certify under penalties of perjury that you have furnished a correct taxpayer identification number and that the internal revenue service has not notified you that you are subject to backup withholding 

 

backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients such as corporations and taxexempt organizations you should consult with a tax advisor regarding qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining an exemption backup withholding is not an additional tax rather the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a stockholder will be allowed as a credit against such stockholder’s united states federal income tax liability and may entitle such stockholder to a refund provided that the required information is provided to the internal revenue service in addition withholding a portion of capital gain distributions made to stockholders may be required for stockholders who fail to certify their nonforeign status 

taxation of foreign stockholders the following summary applies to you only if you are a foreign person the federal taxation of foreign persons is a highly complex matter that may be affected by many considerations 

 

except as discussed below distributions to you of cash generated by our real estate operations in the form of ordinary dividends but not by the sale or exchange of our capital assets generally will be subject to us withholding tax at a rate of 30 unless an applicable tax treaty reduces that tax and you file with us the required form evidencing the lower rate 

 

in general you will be subject to united states federal income tax on a graduated rate basis rather than withholding with respect to your investment in our stock if such investment is “effectively connected” with your conduct of a trade or business in the united states a corporate foreign stockholder that receives income that is or is treated as effectively connected with a united states trade or business may also be subject to the branch profits tax which is payable in addition to regular united states corporate income tax the following discussion will apply to foreign stockholders whose investment in us is not so effectively connected we expect to withhold united states income tax as described below on the gross amount of any distributions paid to you unless 1 you file an internal revenue service form w8eci with us claiming that the distribution is “effectively connected” or 2 certain other exceptions apply 

 

distributions by us that are attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a united states real property interest will be taxed to you under the foreign investment in real property tax act of 1980 “firpta” as if these distributions were gains “effectively connected” with a united states trade or business accordingly you will be taxed at the normal capital gain rates applicable to a us stockholder on these amounts subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals distributions subject to firpta may also be subject to a branch profits tax in the hands of a corporate foreign stockholder that is not entitled to treaty exemption 

 

we will be required to withhold from distributions subject to firpta and remit to the internal revenue service 35 of designated capital gain dividends or if greater 35 of the amount of any distributions that could be designated as capital gain dividends in addition if we designate prior distributions as capital gain dividends subsequent distributions up to the amount of the prior distributions not withheld against will be treated as capital gain dividends for purposes of withholding 

 

for taxable years beginning after october 22 2004 any capital gain dividend with respect to any class of stock that is “regularly traded” on an established securities market will be treated as an ordinary dividend if the foreign stockholder did not own more than 5 of such class of stock at any time during the taxable year once this provision takes effect foreign stockholders generally will not be required to report distributions received from us on us federal income tax returns and all distributions treated as dividends for us federal income tax purposes including any capital gain dividend will be subject to a 30 us withholding tax unless reduced under an applicable income tax treaty as discussed above in addition the branch profits tax will no longer apply to such distributions 

 

unless our shares constitute a “united states real property interest” within the meaning of firpta or are effectively connected with a us trade or business a sale of our shares by you generally will not be subject to united states taxation our shares will not constitute a united states real property interest if we qualify as a “domestically controlled reit” we believe that we and expect to continue to qualify as a domestically controlled reit a domestically controlled reit is a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50 in value of its shares is held directly or indirectly by foreign stockholders however if you are a nonresident alien individual who is present in the united states for 183 days or more during the taxable year and certain other conditions apply you will be subject to a 30 tax on such capital gains in any event a purchaser of our shares from you will not be required under firpta to withhold on the purchase price if the purchased shares are “regularly traded” on an established securities market or if we are a domestically controlled reit otherwise under firpta the purchaser may be required to withhold 10 of the purchase price and remit such amount to the internal revenue service 

 

backup withholding tax and information reporting will generally not apply to distributions paid to you outside the united states that are treated as 1 dividends to which the 30 or lower treaty rate withholding tax discussed 

above applies 2 capital gains dividends or 3 distributions attributable to gain from the sale or exchange by us of us real property interests payment of the proceeds of a sale of stock within the united states or conducted through certain us related financial intermediaries is subject to both backup withholding and information reporting unless the beneficial owner certifies under penalties of perjury that he or she is not a us person and the payor does not have actual knowledge that the beneficial owner is a us person or otherwise established an exemption you may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for refund with the internal revenue service 

 

us federal income taxation of holders of depositary shares 

 

owners of our depositary shares will be treated as if you were owners of the series of preferred stock represented by the depositary shares thus you will be required to take into account the income and deductions to which you would be entitled if you were a holder of the underlying series of preferred stock 

 

conversion or exchange of shares for preferred stock no gain or loss will be recognized upon the withdrawal of preferred stock in exchange for depositary shares and the tax basis of each share of preferred stock will upon exchange be the same as the aggregate tax basis of the depositary shares exchanged if you held your depositary shares as a capital asset at the time of the exchange for shares of preferred stock the holding period for your shares of preferred stock will include the period during which you owned the depositary shares

forwardlooking statements and risk factors 

 

this section discusses the most significant factors that affect our business operations and financial condition it does not describe all risks and uncertainties applicable to us our industry or ownership of our securities if any of the following risks as well as other risks and uncertainties that are not yet identified or that we currently think are not material actually occur we could be materially adversely affected in that event the value of our securities could decline 

 

this annual report on form 10k and the documents incorporated by reference contain statements that constitute “forwardlooking statements” as that term is defined in the federal securities laws these forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to those regarding 

 

  

when we use words such as “may” “will” “intend” “should” “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “project” “estimate” or similar expressions we are making forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties our expected results may not be achieved and actual results may differ materially from our expectations this may be a result of various factors including but not limited to

risk factors related to our operators’ revenues and expenses 

 

our investment property operators’ revenues are primarily driven by occupancy medicare and medicaid reimbursement if applicable and private pay rates expenses for these facilities are primarily driven by the costs of labor food utilities taxes insurance and rent or debt service revenues from government reimbursement have and may continue to come under pressure due to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls liability insurance and staffing costs continue to increase for our operators to the extent that any decrease in revenues andor any increase in operating expenses result in a property not generating enough cash to make payments to us the credit of our operator and the value of other collateral would have to be relied upon 

 

the ongoing credit and liquidity crisis and the weakening economy may have an adverse effect on our operators and tenants including their ability to access credit or maintain occupancy rates if the operations cash flows or financial condition of our operators are materially adversely impacted by the current economic conditions our revenue and operations may be adversely affected 

 

increased competition may affect our operators’ ability to meet their obligations to us 

 

the operators of our properties compete on a local and regional basis with operators of properties and other health care providers that provide comparable services we cannot be certain that the operators of all of our facilities will be able to achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us our operators are expected to encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to attract residents or expand their businesses 

 

risk factors related to obligor bankruptcies 

 

we are exposed to the risk that our obligors may not be able to meet the rent principal and interest or other payments due us which may result in an obligor bankruptcy or insolvency or that an obligor might become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings for other reasons although our operating lease agreements provide us with the right to evict a tenant demand immediate payment of rent and exercise other remedies and our loans 

provide us with the right to terminate any funding obligation demand immediate repayment of principal and unpaid interest foreclose on the collateral and exercise other remedies the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization an obligor in bankruptcy or subject to insolvency proceedings may be able to limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent in the case of a lease or to receive unpaid principal and interest in the case of a loan and to exercise other rights and remedies 

 

we may be required to fund certain expenses eg real estate taxes and maintenance to preserve the value of an investment property avoid the imposition of liens on a property andor transition a property to a new tenant in some instances we have terminated our lease with a tenant and relet the property to another tenant in some of those situations we have provided working capital loans to and limited indemnification of the new obligor if we cannot transition a leased property to a new tenant we may take possession of that property which may expose us to certain successor liabilities should such events occur our revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely affected 

 

transfers of health care facilities may require regulatory approvals and these facilities may not have efficient alternative uses 

 

transfers of health care facilities to successor operators frequently are subject to regulatory approvals including change of ownership approvals under certificate of need “con” laws state licensure laws and medicare and medicaid provider arrangements that are not required for transfers of other types of real estate the replacement of an operator could be delayed by the approval process of any federal state or local agency necessary for the transfer of the facility or the replacement of the operator licensed to manage the facility alternatively given the specialized nature of our facilities we may be required to spend substantial time and funds to adapt these properties to other uses if we are unable to timely transfer properties to successor operators or find efficient alternative uses our revenue and operations may be adversely affected 

 

risk factors related to government regulations 

 

our obligors’ businesses are affected by government reimbursement and private payor rates to the extent that an operatortenant receives a significant portion of its revenues from governmental payors primarily medicare and medicaid such revenues may be subject to statutory and regulatory changes retroactive rate adjustments recovery of program overpayments or setoffs administrative rulings policy interpretations payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers government funding restrictions at a program level or with respect to specific facilities and interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing governmental investigations and audits at such property in recent years governmental payors have frozen or reduced payments to health care providers due to budgetary pressures health care reimbursement will likely continue to be of paramount importance to federal and state authorities we cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or effect any future legislative reforms may have on the financial condition of our obligors and properties there can be no assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will be available for services provided by any property operator whether the property receives reimbursement from medicare medicaid or private payors significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on an obligor’s liquidity financial condition and results of operations which could adversely affect the ability of an obligor to meet its obligations to us see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — reimbursement” above 

 

our operators and tenants generally are subject to extensive federal state and local licensure certification and inspection laws and regulations our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with any of these laws could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension or decertification from federal and state health care programs loss of license or closure of the facility such actions may have an effect on our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make lease payments to us and therefore adversely impact us see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — other related laws” above 

 

many of our properties may require a license andor con to operate failure to obtain a license or con or loss of a required license or con would prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by the operators or tenants these events could materially adversely affect our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make rent payments to us state and local laws also may regulate expansion including the addition of new beds or services or acquisition of 

medical equipment and the construction of health care facilities by requiring a con or other similar approval see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — licensing and certification” above 

 

the american reinvestment and recovery act of 2009 which was signed into law on february 17 2009 provides 87 billion in additional federal medicaid funding for states’ medicaid expenditures between october 1 2008 and december 31 2010 under this act states meeting certain eligibility requirements will temporarily receive additional money in the form of an increase in the federal medical assistance percentage fmap thus for a limited period of time the share of medicaid costs that are paid for by the federal government will go up and each state’s share will go down we cannot predict whether states are or will remain eligible to receive the additional federal medicaid funding or whether the states will have sufficient funds for their medicaid programs we also cannot predict the impact that this broadbased farreaching legislation will have on the us economy or our business 

 

risk factors related to liability claims and insurance costs 

 

in recent years skilled nursing and seniors housing operators have experienced substantial increases in both the number and size of patient care liability claims as a result general and professional liability costs have increased in some markets however a recent report and state survey found that the liability insurance market is beginning to stabilize in most markets in 2008 national average liability loss costs were stable for the first time in nearly a decade stateled tort reform efforts have greatly contributed to decreasing costs in some markets general and professional liability insurance coverage continues to be restricted or very costly which may adversely affect the property operators’ future operations cash flows and financial condition and may have a material adverse effect on the property operators’ ability to meet their obligations to us 

 

risk factors related to acquisitions 

 

we are exposed to the risk that some of our acquisitions may not prove to be successful we could encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired properties including contingent liabilities and acquired properties might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business if we agree to provide construction funding to an operatortenant and the project is not completed we may need to take steps to ensure completion of the project moreover if we issue equity securities or incur additional debt or both to finance future acquisitions it may reduce our per share financial results these costs may negatively affect our results of operations 

 

risk factors related to joint ventures 

 

we have entered into and may continue in the future to enter into partnerships or joint ventures with other persons or entities joint venture investments involve risks including the possibility that our partner might become insolvent or otherwise refuse to make capital contributions when due that our partner might at any time have investment goals which are inconsistent with ours that we could become engaged in a dispute with our partner which could require us to expend additional resources to resolve such disputes and that our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests in addition our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted in some instances we and our partner may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partner’s interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction joint ventures require us to share decisionmaking authority with our partners which limits our ability to control the properties in the joint ventures even when we have a controlling interest certain major decisions may require partner approval 

 

risk factors related to life sciences facilities 

 

our tenants in the life sciences industry face high levels of regulation expense and uncertainty that may adversely affect their ability to make payments to us research development and clinical testing of products and technologies can be very expensive and sources of funds may not be available to our life sciences tenants in the future the products and technologies that are developed and manufactured by our life sciences tenants may require regulatory approval prior to being made marketed sold and used the regulatory process can be costly long and 

unpredictable even after a tenant gains regulatory approval and market acceptance the product still presents regulatory and liability risks such as safety concerns competition from new products and eventually the expiration of patent protection these factors may affect the ability of our life sciences tenants to make timely payments to us which may adversely affect our revenue and operations 

 

risk factors related to indebtedness 

 

permanent financing for our investments is typically provided through a combination of public and private offerings of debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt the incurrence or assumption of indebtedness may cause us to become more leveraged which could 1 require us to dedicate a greater portion of our cash flow to the payment of debt service 2 make us more vulnerable to a downturn in the economy 3 limit our ability to obtain additional financing or 4 negatively affect our credit ratings or outlook by one or more of the noted rating agencies 

 

our debt agreements contain various covenants restrictions and events of default among other things these provisions require us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness create liens and make investments or acquisitions breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness in addition to any other indebtedness crossdefaulted against such instruments these defaults could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

risk factors related to our credit ratings 

 

as of february 12 2010 our senior unsecured notes were rated baa2 stable bbb positive and bbb stable by moody’s investors service standard  poor’s ratings services and fitch ratings respectively we plan to manage the company to maintain investment grade status with a capital structure consistent with our current profile but there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the noted rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity andor financial condition 

 

risk factors related to interest rate swaps 

 

we enter into interest rate swap agreements from time to time to manage some of our exposure to interest rate volatility these swap agreements involve risks such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements in addition these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates when we use forwardstarting interest rate swaps there is a risk that we will not complete the longterm borrowing against which the swap is intended to hedge if such events occur our results of operations may be adversely affected 

 

risk factors related to environmental laws 

 

under various federal and state laws owners or operators of real estate may be required to respond to the presence or release of hazardous substances on the property and may be held liable for property damage personal injuries or penalties that result from environmental contamination or exposure to hazardous substances we may become liable to reimburse the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination generally such liability attaches to a person based on the person’s relationship to the property our tenants or borrowers are primarily responsible for the condition of the property moreover we review environmental site assessments of the properties that we own or encumber prior to taking an interest in them those assessments are designed to meet the “all appropriate inquiry” standard which we believe qualifies us for the innocent purchaser defense if environmental liabilities arise based upon such assessments we do not believe that any of our properties are subject to material environmental contamination however environmental liabilities may be present in our properties and we may incur costs to remediate contamination which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition or the business or financial condition of our obligors 

 

risk factors related to facilities that require entrance fees 

 

certain of our senior housing facilities require the payment of an upfront entrance fee by the resident a portion of which may be refundable by the operator some of these facilities are subject to substantial oversight by state regulators relating to these funds as a result of this oversight residents of these facilities may have a variety of rights including for example the right to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time and certain lien rights the oversight and rights of residents within these facilities may have an effect on the revenue or operations of the operators of such facilities and therefore may negatively impact us 

 

risk factors related to facilities under construction or development 

 

at any given time we may be in the process of constructing one or more new facilities that ultimately will require a con and license before they can be utilized by the operator for their intended use the operator also may need to obtain medicare and medicaid certification and enter into medicare and medicaid provider agreements andor third party payor contracts in the event that the operator is unable to obtain the necessary con licensure certification provider agreements or contracts after the completion of construction there is a risk that we will not be able to earn any revenues on the facility until either the initial operator obtains a license or certification to operate the new facility and the necessary provider agreements or contracts or we can find and contract with a new operator that is able to obtain a license to operate the facility for its intended use and the necessary provider agreements or contracts 

 

in connection with our renovation redevelopment development and related construction activities we may be unable to obtain or suffer delays in obtaining necessary zoning landuse building occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations these factors could result in increased costs or our abandonment of these projects in addition we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms which may render us unable to proceed with our development activities and we may not be able to complete construction and leaseup of a property on schedule which could result in increased debt service expense or construction costs 

 

additionally the time frame required for development construction and leaseup of these properties means that we may have to wait years for significant cash returns because we are required to make cash distributions to our stockholders if the cash flow from operations or refinancing is not sufficient we may be forced to borrow additional money to fund such distributions newly developed and acquired properties may not produce the cash flow that we expect which could adversely affect our overall financial performance 

 

in deciding whether to acquire or develop a particular property we make assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property in particular we estimate the return on our investment based on expected occupancy and rental rates if our financial projections with respect to a new property are inaccurate and the property is unable to achieve the expected occupancy and rental rates it may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment our estimate of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove to be inaccurate which may result in our failure to meet our profitability goals additionally we may acquire new properties that are not fully leased and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with that property 

 

we do not know if our tenants will renew their existing leases and if they do not we may be unable to lease the properties on as favorable terms or at all 

 

we cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases at the end of their lease terms which expire at various times through 2079 if these leases are not renewed we would be required to find other tenants to occupy those properties or sell them there can be no assurance that we would be able to identify suitable replacement tenants or enter into leases with new tenants on terms as favorable to us as the current leases or that we would be able to lease those properties at all 

 

our ownership of properties through ground leases exposes us to the loss of such properties upon breach or termination of the ground leases 

 

we have acquired an interest in certain of our properties by acquiring a leasehold interest in the property on which the building is located and we may acquire additional properties in the future through the purchase of interests in ground leases as the lessee under a ground lease we are exposed to the possibility of losing the property upon termination of the ground lease or an earlier breach of the ground lease by us 

illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties 

 

real estate investments are relatively illiquid our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in economic and other conditions will be limited no assurances can be given that we will recognize full value for any property that we are required to sell for liquidity reasons our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition we are exposed to the risks inherent in concentrating investments in real estate and in particular the seniors housing and health care industries a downturn in the real estate industry could adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to sell properties for a price or on terms acceptable to us 

 

risk factors related to reinvestment of sale proceeds 

 

from time to time we will have cash available from 1 the proceeds of sales of our securities 2 principal payments on our loans receivable and 3 the sale of properties including nonelective dispositions under the terms of master leases or similar financial support arrangements in order to maintain current revenues and continue generating attractive returns we expect to reinvest these proceeds in a timely manner we compete for real estate investments with a broad variety of potential investors this competition for attractive investments may negatively affect our ability to make timely investments on terms acceptable to us 

 

failure to properly manage our rapid growth could distract our management or increase our expenses 

 

we have experienced rapid growth and development in a relatively short period of time and expect to continue this rapid growth in the future this growth has resulted in increased levels of responsibility for our management future property acquisitions could place significant additional demands on and require us to expand our management resources and personnel our failure to manage any such rapid growth effectively could harm our business and in particular our financial condition results of operations and cash flows which could negatively affect our ability to make distributions to stockholders our growth could also increase our capital requirements which may require us to issue potentially dilutive equity securities and incur additional debt 

 

we might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

 

we intend to operate as a reit under the internal revenue code and believe we have and will continue to operate in such a manner if we lose our status as a reit we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for satisfying our obligations and for distribution to our stockholders for each of the years involved because 

 

  

since reit qualification requires us to meet a number of complex requirements it is possible that we may fail to fulfill them and if we do our earnings will be reduced by the amount of federal taxes owed a reduction in our earnings would affect the amount we could distribute to our stockholders if we do not qualify as a reit we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders since a nonreit is not required in order to maintain reit status or avoid an excise tax to pay dividends to stockholders see “item 1 — business — federal income tax considerations” for a discussion of the provisions of the internal revenue code that apply to us and the effects of nonqualification 

 

in addition if we fail to qualify as a reit all distributions to stockholders would continue to be treated as dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits although corporate stockholders may be eligible for the dividends received deduction and individual stockholders may be eligible for taxation at the rates generally applicable to longterm capital gains currently at a maximum rate of 15 with respect to distributions 

 

as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to implement our business strategy and would adversely affect the value of our common stock 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to remain qualified as a reit although we believe that we qualify as a reit we cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify or remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations” included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

the 90 annual distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions 

 

to comply with the 90 distribution requirement applicable to reits and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax we must make distributions to our stockholders see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations — qualification as a reit — annual distribution requirements” included in this annual report on form 10k although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the reit distribution requirement it is possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90 distribution requirement or we may decide to retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation this may be due to timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses on the one hand and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income on the other hand in addition nondeductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of noncash deductions may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90 distribution requirement in the event that timing differences occur or we deem it appropriate to retain cash we may borrow funds issue additional equity securities although we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so pay taxable stock dividends if possible distribute other property or securities or engage in a transaction intended to enable us to meet the reit distribution requirements this may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations 

 

the amount of additional indebtedness we may incur is limited by the terms of our line of credit arrangement and the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes in addition adverse economic conditions may impact the availability of additional funds or could cause the terms on which we are able to borrow additional funds to become unfavorable in those circumstances we may be required to raise additional equity in the capital markets our access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control including rising interest rates inflation and other general market conditions and the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of the shares of our capital stock we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the capital necessary to make future investments or to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature 

 

other risk factors 

 

we are also subject to other risks first our second restated certificate of incorporation and second amended and restated bylaws contain antitakeover provisions staggered board provisions restrictions on share ownership and transfer and super majority stockholder approval requirements for business combinations that could make it more difficult for or even prevent a third party from acquiring us without the approval of our incumbent board of directors provisions and agreements that inhibit or discourage takeover attempts could reduce the market value of our common stock 

 

additionally we are dependent on key personnel although we have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers losing any one of them could at least temporarily have an adverse impact on our operations we believe that losing more than one could have a material adverse impact on our business

the demand for health care services and consequently health care properties is projected to reach unprecedented levels in the near future the centers for medicare and medicaid services projects that national health expenditures will rise to 34 trillion in 2015 or 177 of gross domestic product “gdp” this is up from 2 trillion or 159 of gdp in 2005 health expenditures per capita are projected to rise approximately 47 per year from 2005 to 2015 while demographics are the primary driver of demand economic conditions and availability of services contribute to health care service utilization rates we believe the health care property market is less susceptible to fluctuations and economic downturns relative to other property sectors investor interest in the market remains strong especially in specific sectors such as medical office buildings regardless of the current stringent lending environment as a reit we believe we are situated to benefit from any turbulence in the capital markets due to our access to capital 

 

the total us population is projected to increase by 164 through 2030 the elderly are an important component of health care utilization especially independent living services assisted living services skilled nursing services inpatient and outpatient hospital services and physician ambulatory care the elderly population aged 65 and over is projected to increase by 766 through 2030 most health care services are provided within a health care facility such as a hospital a physician’s office or a senior housing facility therefore we believe there will be continued demand for companies such as ours with expertise in health care real estate 

the following chart illustrates the projected increase in the elderly population aged 65 and over

health care real estate investment opportunities tend to increase as demand for health care services increases we recognize the need for health care real estate as it correlates to health care service demand health care providers require real estate to house their businesses and expand their services we believe that investment opportunities in health care real estate will continue to be present due to the 

 

  

recent developments both the senate and house of representatives have passed legislation to reform the us health care system by the time this report is released final reform legislation may already have been passed the legislation involves the expansion of insurance coverage primarily through reform of the private insurance market as well as changes to existing government programs the reform efforts are intended to lead to more efficient effective care reduce waste and benefit the most efficient qualityconscious providers as a company we are wellsituated to respond to any changes in health care delivery and organization resulting from this legislation future reform broadened insurance coverage changes in medicare and medicaid changes in provider reimbursement and changes in health care sector funding could have a significant impact on our operators’ financial situation and strategy which we will continue to monitor 

 

economic outlook 

 

beginning in late 2007 the us and global economy entered a serious recession the current economic environment is characterized by a severe residential housing slump depressed commercial real estate valuations weakened consumer confidence rising unemployment and concerns regarding inflation deflation and stagflation numerous financial systems around the globe have become illiquid and banks have become less willing to lend to other banks and borrowers further capital markets have become and remain volatile as risk is repriced and investments are revalued uncertainty remains in terms of the depth and duration of these adverse economic conditions 

 

the conditions described above have created an environment of limited capital availability and increasing capital costs this was most evident in the credit markets where lending institutions cut back on loans tightened credit standards and significantly increased interest rate spreads the equity markets were characterized by sporadic accessibility until late 2008 when share prices in most sectors declined significantly continued volatility in the capital markets could limit our ability to access debt or equity funds which in turn could impact our ability to finance future investments and react to changing economic and business conditions this difficult operating environment also may make it more difficult for some of our operatorstenants to meet their obligations to us 

during 2008 our focus gradually shifted from investment to capital preservation to that end our efforts in 2009 were directed towards liquidity portfolio management and investment strategy 

 

  

business strategy 

 

our primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and enhance stockholder value we seek to pay consistent cash dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual increases in rental and interest income and portfolio growth to meet these objectives we invest across the full spectrum of senior housing and health care real estate and diversify our investment portfolio by property type operatortenant and geographic location 

 

substantially all of our revenues and sources of cash flows from operations are derived from operating lease rentals and interest earned on outstanding loans receivable these items represent our primary source of liquidity to fund distributions and are dependent upon our obligors’ continued ability to make contractual rent and interest payments to us to the extent that our obligors experience operating difficulties and are unable to generate sufficient cash to make payments to us there could be a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity andor financial condition to mitigate this risk we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property and operatortenant our asset management process includes review of monthly financial statements for each property periodic review of obligor credit periodic property inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure real estate taxes letters of credit and other collateral in monitoring our portfolio our personnel use a proprietary database to collect and analyze propertyspecific data additionally we conduct extensive research to ascertain industry trends and risks through these asset management and research efforts we are typically able to intervene at an early stage to address payment risk and in so doing support both the collectability of revenue and the value of our investment 

 

in addition to our asset management and research efforts we also structure our investments to help mitigate payment risk operating leases and loans are normally credit enhanced by guaranties andor letters of credit in addition operating leases are typically structured as master leases and loans are generally crossdefaulted and crosscollateralized with other loans operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its affiliates 

 

for the year ended december 31 2009 rental income and interest income represented 90 and 7 respectively of total gross revenues including discontinued operations substantially all of our operating leases are designed with either fixed or contingent escalating rent structures leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straightline basis over the initial lease period subject to a collectability assessment rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period our yield on loans receivable depends upon a number of factors including the stated interest rate the average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments 

depending upon the availability and cost of external capital we believe our liquidity is sufficient to fund operations meet debt service obligations both principal and interest make dividend distributions and complete construction projects in process we also anticipate evaluating opportunities to finance future investments new investments are generally funded from temporary borrowings under our unsecured line of credit arrangement internally generated cash and the proceeds from sales of real property our investments generate internal cash from rent and interest receipts and principal payments on loans receivable permanent financing for future investments which replaces funds drawn under the unsecured line of credit arrangement has historically been provided through a combination of public and private offerings of debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt 

 

depending upon market conditions we believe that new investments will be available in the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to our stockholders we expect to complete gross new investments of 10 to 12 billion in 2010 comprised of new investments totaling 700000000 to 800000000 and funded new development of 300000000 to 400000000 we anticipate the sale of real property and the repayment of loans receivable totaling approximately 300000000 during 2010 it is possible that additional loan repayments or sales of real property may occur in the future to the extent that loan repayments and real property sales exceed new investments our revenues and cash flows from operations could be adversely affected we expect to reinvest the proceeds from any loan repayments and real property sales in new investments to the extent that new investment requirements exceed our available cash onhand we expect to borrow under our unsecured line of credit arrangement at december 31 2009 we had 35476000 of cash and cash equivalents 23237000 of restricted cash and 1010000000 of available borrowing capacity under our unsecured line of credit arrangement our investment activity may exceed our borrowing capacity under our unsecured line of credit to the extent that we are unable to issue equity or debt securities to provide additional capital we may not be able to fund all of our potential investments which could have an adverse effect on our revenues and cash flows from operations

key performance indicators trends and uncertainties 

 

we utilize several key performance indicators to evaluate the various aspects of our business these indicators are discussed below and relate to operating performance credit strength and concentration risk management uses these key performance indicators to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results and in making operating decisions 

 

operating performance we believe that net income attributable to common stockholders “nics” is the most appropriate earnings measure other useful supplemental measures of our operating performance include funds from operations “ffo” and net operating income “noi” however these supplemental measures are not defined by us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” please refer to the section entitled “nongaap financial measures” for further discussion of ffo and noi and for reconciliations of ffo and noi these earnings measures and their relative per share amounts are widely used by investors and analysts in the valuation comparison and investment recommendations of reits the following table reflects the recent historical trends of our operating performance measures in thousands except per share data 

 

 

 

credit strength we measure our credit strength both in terms of leverage ratios and coverage ratios our leverage ratios include debt to book capitalization debt to undepreciated book capitalization and debt to market capitalization the leverage ratios indicate how much of our balance sheet capitalization is related to total debt our coverage ratios include interest coverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio the coverage ratios indicate our ability to service interest and fixed charges interest plus preferred dividends and secured debt principal amortizations we expect to maintain capitalization ratios and coverage ratios sufficient to maintain investment grade ratings with moody’s investors service standard  poor’s ratings services and fitch ratings the coverage ratios are based on adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “adjusted ebitda” which is discussed in further detail and reconciled to net income below in “nongaap financial measures” leverage ratios and coverage ratios are widely used by investors analysts and rating agencies in the valuation comparison 

investment recommendations and rating of companies the following table reflects the recent historical trends for our credit strength measures 

 

 

 

concentration risk we evaluate our concentration risk in terms of asset mix investment mix customer mix and geographic mix concentration risk is a valuable measure in understanding what portion of our investments could be at risk if certain sectors were to experience downturns asset mix measures the portion of our investments that are real property in order to qualify as an equity reit at least 75 of our real estate investments must be real property whereby each property which includes the land buildings improvements intangibles and related rights is owned by us and leased to an operator pursuant to a longterm operating lease investment mix measures the portion of our investments that relate to our various property types customer mix measures the portion of our investments that relate to our top five customers geographic mix measures the portion of our investments that relate to our top five states the following table reflects our recent historical trends of concentration risk 

 

 

 

we evaluate our key performance indicators in conjunction with current expectations to determine if historical trends are indicative of future results our expected results may not be achieved and actual results may differ 

materially from our expectations management regularly monitors various economic and other factors to develop strategic and tactical plans designed to improve performance and maximize our competitive position our ability to achieve our financial objectives is dependent upon our ability to effectively execute these plans and to appropriately respond to emerging economic and companyspecific trends please refer to “item 1a — risk factors” above for further discussion 

 

portfolio update 

 

net operating income the primary performance measure for our properties is net operating income “noi” as discussed below in “nongaap financial measures” the following table summarizes our net operating income for the periods indicated in thousands

the following is a summary of our straightline rent dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

gross straightline rental income represents the noncash difference between contractual cash rent due and the average rent recognized pursuant to us gaap for leases with fixed rental escalators net of collectability reserves if any this amount is positive in the first half of a lease term but declining every year due to annual increases in cash rent due and is negative in the second half of a lease term the fluctuation in cash receipts due to real property sales is attributable to a decline in straightline rent receivable balances on properties sold the change in prepaid rent cash receipts is due to the mix of real property acquisitions during the periods presented we typically receive prepaid rent in connection with investment property acquisitions 

investing activities the changes in net cash used in investing activities are primarily attributable to changes in loans receivable and real property investments the following is a summary of our investment and disposition activities dollars in thousands

investment properties 

 

the following is a summary of our results of operations for the investment properties segment dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

the increase in rental income is primarily attributable to the acquisitions of new investment properties from which we receive rent see the discussion of investing activities in “liquidity and capital resources” above for further information certain of our leases contain annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the consumer price index andor changes in the gross operating revenues of the tenant’s properties these escalators are not fixed so no straightline rent is recorded however rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period if gross operating revenues at our facilities andor the consumer price index do not increase a portion of our revenues may not continue to increase sales of real property would offset revenue increases and to the extent that they exceed new acquisitions could result in decreased revenues our leases could renew above or below current rent rates resulting in an increase or decrease in rental income interest income increased from 2007 primarily due to an increase in the balance of outstanding loans 

interest expense for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 represents 12229000 7176000 and 8763000 respectively of secured debt interest expense offset by interest allocated to discontinued operations the change in secured debt interest expense is due to the net effect and timing of assumptions extinguishments and principal amortizations during the year ended december 31 2009 we extinguished 12 investment property secured debt loans and recognized extinguishment losses of 2057000 during the year ended december 31 2008 we extinguished four investment property secured debt loans and recognized extinguishment gains of 808000 the following is a summary of our investment property secured debt principal activity dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

depreciation and amortization increased primarily as a result of additional investments in properties owned directly by us see the discussion of investing activities in “liquidity and capital resources” above for additional details to the extent that we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future our provision for depreciation and amortization will change accordingly 

 

at december 31 2009 we had two skilled nursing facilities and one hospital that satisfied the requirements for held for sale treatment we did not recognize an impairment loss on the skilled nursing facilities as the fair value less estimated costs to sell exceeded our carrying value in determining the fair value of the hospital we used a combination of third party appraisals based on market comparable transactions other market listings and asset quality management’s estimates projected that the carrying value of the asset was more than the estimated fair value and an impairment charge of 10266000 was recorded to reduce the property to its estimated fair value less costs to sell during the year ended december 31 2009 we sold 23 investment properties with carrying values of 141996000 for net gains of 46439000 the following illustrates the reclassification impact as a result of classifying investment properties as discontinued operations for the periods presented please refer to note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion

medical office buildings 

 

the following is a summary of our results of operations for the medical office building segment dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

in may 2007 we completed the acquisition of 17 medical office buildings and paramount real estate services a property management company from affiliates of rendina companies the results of operations for these properties and paramount have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition and represent the primary component of change in results of operations for this segment from 2007 to 2008 

 

the increase in rental income is primarily attributable to the acquisitions of medical office buildings from which we receive rent see the discussion of investing activities in “liquidity and capital resources” above for further information certain of our leases contain annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the consumer price index these escalators are not fixed so no straightline rent is recorded however rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period if the consumer price index does not increase a portion of our revenues may not continue to increase sales of real property would offset revenue 

increases and to the extent that they exceed new acquisitions could result in decreased revenues our leases could renew above or below current rent rates resulting in an increase or decrease in rental income the increase in other income is attributable to third party management fee income 

 

interest expense for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 represents 20584000 21828000 and 20174000 respectively of secured debt interest expense offset by interest allocated to discontinued operations interest expense for the year ended december 31 2007 also includes 3104000 of interest expense related to the trust preferred liability the change in secured debt interest expense is primarily due to the net effect and timing of assumptions extinguishments and principal amortizations during the year ended december 31 2009 we extinguished eight medical office building secured debt loans and recognized extinguishment losses of 3781000 during the year ended december 31 2008 we extinguished four medical office building secured debt loans and recognized extinguishment gains of 1286000 the following is a summary of our medical office building secured debt principal activity dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

at january 1 2007 we had 51000000 of trust preferred liability principal outstanding with a fixed annual interest rate of 722 on november 6 2007 we purchased all 50000000 of the outstanding trust preferred securities at par for the purpose of unwinding this financing arrangement and extinguishing the liability of the operating partnership to the subsidiary trust and recorded a 1081000 gain on extinguishment of debt 

 

the increase in property operating expenses is primarily attributable to the acquisition of new medical office buildings for which we incur certain property operating expenses offset by property operating expenses associated with discontinued operations 

 

depreciation and amortization increased primarily as a result of additional investments in properties owned directly by us see the discussion of investing activities in “liquidity and capital resources” above for additional details to the extent that we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future our provision for depreciation and amortization will change accordingly 

 

income tax expense is related to third party management fee income 

 

at december 31 2009 we had seven medical office buildings that satisfied the requirements for held for sale treatment in determining the fair value of the assets we used a combination of third party appraisals based on market comparable transactions other market listings and asset quality as well as management calculations based on projected net operating income and published capitalization rates management’s estimates projected that the carrying value of the assets was more than the estimated fair value and an impairment charge of 14957000 was recorded to reduce the properties to their estimated fair value during the year ended december 31 2009 we sold 13 medical office buildings with carrying values of 44717000 for a loss of 3045000 the following illustrates the 

reclassification impact as a result of classifying these medical office buildings as discontinued operations for the periods presented please refer to note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion

other income primarily represents income from nonreal estate activities such as interest earned on temporary investments of cash reserves 

the following is a summary of our nonsegmentcorporate interest expense dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

the change in interest expense on senior unsecured notes is due to the net effect and timing of issuances and extinguishments the following is a summary of our senior unsecured notes activity dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

the change in interest expense on unsecured lines of credit arrangements is due primarily to changes in average amounts outstanding and fluctuating variable interest rates the following is a summary of our unsecured lines of credit arrangements dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

we capitalize certain interest costs associated with funds used to finance the construction of properties owned directly by us the amount capitalized is based upon the borrowings outstanding during the construction period using the rate of interest that approximates our cost of financing our interest expense is reduced by the amount capitalized capitalized interest for the years ended december 31 2007 2008 and 2009 totaled 12526000 25029000 and 41170000 respectively 

 

please see note 9 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our interest rate swap agreements and their impact on interest expense 

 

loan expense represents the amortization of deferred loan costs incurred in connection with the issuance and amendments of debt the change in loan expense is primarily due to costs associated with the issuance of 400000000 of senior unsecured convertible notes in july 2007 and costs associated with the extension and expansion of our unsecured line of credit in august 2007 

 

general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues including revenues from discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2009 were 833 as compared with 824 and 764 for the same periods in 2008 and 2007 during the year ended december 31 2007 we recorded 1750000 of one 

time acquisition finders’ fees paid to former windrose management in connection with the closing of the rendinaparamount transaction these fees relate to services rendered prior to the consummation of the windrose merger in december 2006 due to the recipients’ then current employment status with the company the fees were expensed as compensation rather than included in the purchase price of the acquisition as is typical with such fees the increase from 2007 to 2008 is primarily due to 2291000 of nonrecurring terminated transaction costs and costs associated with our initiatives to attract and retain appropriate personnel to achieve our business objectives the terminated transaction costs primarily related to the termination of the arcapitasunrise agreement the increase from 2008 to 2009 is primarily due to 3909000 of nonrecurring expenses recognized in connection with the departure of raymond w braun who formerly served as president of the company 

 

the change in preferred dividends is primarily due to the change in average outstanding preferred shares the following is a summary of our preferred stock activity 

 

 

 

nongaap financial measures 

 

we believe that net income attributable to common stockholders as defined by us gaap is the most appropriate earnings measurement however we consider ffo to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with us gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation however since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient in response the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” created ffo as a supplemental measure of operating performance for reits that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income attributable to common stockholders ffo as defined by nareit means net income attributable to common stockholders computed in accordance with us gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 

 

net operating income “noi” is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties we define noi as total revenues including tenant reimbursements less property operating expenses which exclude depreciation and amortization general and administrative expenses impairments and interest expense we believe noi provides investors relevant and useful information because it measures the operating performance of our properties at the property level on an unleveraged basis we use noi to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess the property level performance of our properties 

 

ebitda stands for earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization a covenant in our line of credit arrangement contains a financial ratio based on a definition of ebitda that is specific to that agreement failure to satisfy this covenant could result in an event of default that could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity andor financial condition due to the materiality of this debt agreement and the financial covenant we have disclosed adjusted ebitda which represents ebitda as defined above and adjusted for stockbased compensation expense provision for loan losses and gainloss on extinguishment of debt we use adjusted ebitda to measure our adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio which represents adjusted ebitda divided by fixed charges on a trailing twelve months basis fixed charges include total interest excluding capitalized interest secured debt principal amortization and preferred dividends our covenant requires an adjusted fixed charge ratio of at least 175 times 

other than adjusted ebitda our supplemental reporting measures and similarly entitled financial measures are widely used by investors equity and debt analysts and rating agencies in the valuation comparison rating and investment recommendations of companies management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results and in making operating decisions additionally these measures are utilized by the board of directors to evaluate management adjusted ebitda is used solely to determine our compliance with a financial covenant of our line of credit arrangement and is not being presented for use by investors for any other purpose none of our supplemental measures represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with us gaap and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity finally the supplemental reporting measures as defined by us may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies multiperiod amounts may not equal the sum of the individual quarterly amounts due to rounding

critical accounting policies 

 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap which requires us to make estimates and assumptions management considers accounting estimates or assumptions critical if 

 

  

management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate and are not reasonably likely to change in the future however since these estimates require assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made they bear the risk of change if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations liquidity andor financial condition please refer to note 1 of our audited consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact us there were no material changes to these policies in 2009 

the following table presents information about our critical accounting policies as well as the material assumptions used to develop each estimate

impact of inflation 

 

during the past three years inflation has not significantly affected our earnings because of the moderate inflation rate additionally our earnings are primarily longterm investments with fixed rates of return these 

investments are mainly financed with a combination of equity senior unsecured notes and borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements during inflationary periods which generally are accompanied by rising interest rates our ability to grow may be adversely affected because the yield on new investments may increase at a slower rate than new borrowing costs presuming the current inflation rate remains moderate and longterm interest rates do not increase significantly we believe that inflation will not impact the availability of equity and debt financing for us

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

we are exposed to various market risks including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates we seek to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates by matching the terms of new investments with new longterm fixed rate borrowings to the extent possible we may or may not elect to use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate exposure these decisions are principally based on our policy to match our variable rate investments with comparable borrowings but are also based on the general trend in interest rates at the applicable dates and our perception of the future volatility of interest rates this section is presented to provide a discussion of the risks associated with potential fluctuations in interest rates 

 

we historically borrow on our unsecured line of credit arrangement to acquire construct or make loans relating to health care and senior housing properties then as market conditions dictate we will issue equity or longterm fixed rate debt to repay the borrowings under the unsecured line of credit arrangement 

 

a change in interest rates will not affect the interest expense associated with our fixed rate debt interest rate changes however will affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt changes in the interest rate environment upon maturity of this fixed rate debt could have an effect on our future cash flows and earnings depending on whether the debt is replaced with other fixed rate debt variable rate debt or equity or repaid by the sale of assets to illustrate the impact of changes in the interest rate markets we performed a sensitivity analysis on our fixed rate debt instruments whereby we modeled the change in net present values arising from a hypothetical 1 increase in interest rates to determine the instruments’ change in fair value the following table summarizes the analysis performed as of the dates indicated in thousands 

 

 

 

on august 7 2009 we entered into an interest rate swap the “august 2009 swap” for a total notional amount of 52198000 to hedge seven years of interest payments associated with longterm libor based borrowings the august 2009 swap has an effective date of august 12 2009 and a maturity date of september 1 2016 the august 2009 swap has the economic effect of fixing 52198000 at 393 plus a credit spread for seven years the august 2009 swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge and we expect it to be highly effective at offsetting changes in cash flows of interest payments on 52198000 of longterm debt due to changes in the libor swap rate 

 

on september 28 2009 we entered into an interest rate swap the “september 2009 swap” for a total notional amount of 48155000 to hedge seven years of interest payments associated with longterm libor based borrowings the september 2009 swap has an effective date of september 30 2009 and a maturity date of october 1 2016 the september 2009 swap has the economic effect of fixing 48155000 at 32675 plus a credit spread for seven years the september 2009 swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge and we expect it to be highly effective at offsetting changes in cash flows of interest payments on 48155000 of longterm debt due to changes in the libor swap rate 

 

our variable rate debt including our unsecured line of credit arrangement is reflected at fair value at december 31 2009 we had 140000000 outstanding related to our variable rate line of credit and 131952000 outstanding related to our variable rate secured debt assuming no changes in outstanding balances a 1 increase in interest rates would result in increased annual interest expense of 2720000 at december 31 2008 we had 

570000000 outstanding related to our variable rate debt and assuming no changes in outstanding balances a 1 increase in interest rates would have resulted in increased annual interest expense of 5700000 

 

we are subject to risks associated with debt financing including the risk that existing indebtedness may not be refinanced or that the terms of refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of current indebtedness the majority of our borrowings were completed under indentures or contractual agreements that limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur accordingly in the event that we are unable to raise additional equity or borrow money because of these limitations our ability to acquire additional properties may be limited

portfolio of properties 

 

the following table summarizes our portfolio as of december 31 2008 

 

 

 

 

  

property types 

 

our primary property types include investment properties and medical office buildings under the investment property segment we invest in senior housing and health care real estate through acquisition and financing of 

primarily single tenant properties properties acquired are primarily leased under triplenet leases we are not involved in the management of the property our primary investment property types include skilled nursing facilities assisted living facilities independent livingcontinuing care retirement communities and specialty care facilities under the medical office building segment our properties are typically leased to tenants under gross leases modified gross leases or triplenet leases to multiple tenants and generally require a certain level of property management our properties include standalone facilities that provide one level of service combination facilities that provide multiple levels of service and communities or campuses that provide a wide range of services the following is a summary of our various property types 

 

assisted living facilities 

 

assisted living facilities are state regulated rental properties that provide the same services as independent living facilities but also provide supportive care from trained employees to residents who require assistance with activities of daily living including management of medications bathing dressing toileting ambulating and eating 

 

alzheimer’sdementia care facilities certain assisted living facilities may include state licensed settings that specialize in caring for those afflicted with alzheimer’s disease andor similar forms of dementia 

 

skilled nursing facilities 

 

skilled nursing facilities are licensed daily rate or rental properties where the majority of individuals require 24hour nursing andor medical care generally these properties are licensed for medicaid andor medicare reimbursement 

 

independent livingcontinuing care retirement communities 

 

these communities may include one or more of the following property types 

 

continuing care retirement communities continuing care retirement communities include a combination of detached homes an independent living facility an assisted living facility andor a skilled nursing facility on one campus these communities are appealing to residents because there is no need for relocating when health and medical needs change resident payment plans vary but can include entrance fees condominium fees and rental fees many of these communities also charge monthly maintenance fees in exchange for a living unit meals and some health services 

 

active adult communities active adult communities contain primarily forsale singlefamily homes townhomes cluster homes mobile homes andor condominiums with no specialized services these communities are typically restricted or targeted to adults at least 55 years of age or older residents generally lead an independent lifestyle communities may include amenities such as a clubhouse golf course and recreational spaces 

 

independent living facilities independent living facilities are agerestricted multifamily properties with central dining facilities that provide residents access to meals and other services such as housekeeping linen service transportation and social and recreational activities 

 

specialty care facilities 

 

our specialty care facilities generally include acute care hospitals longterm acute care hospitals and other similar properties acute care hospitals provide a wide range of inpatient and outpatient services including but not limited to surgery rehabilitation therapy and clinical laboratories longterm acute care hospitals provide inpatient services for patients with complex medical conditions that require more intensive care monitoring or emergency support than that available in most skilled nursing facilities other specialty care facilities typically provide specialized inpatient and outpatient care for specific illnesses or diseases including among others orthopedic and neurologic care 

medical office buildings 

 

medical office buildings are office and clinic facilities often located near hospitals or on hospital campuses specifically constructed and designed for use by physicians and other health care personnel to provide services to their patients they may also include ambulatory surgery centers that are used for general or specialty surgical procedures not requiring an overnight stay in a hospital medical office buildings typically contain sole and group physician practices and may provide laboratory and other patient services 

 

investments 

 

we invest in senior housing and health care real estate we diversify our investment portfolio by property type operatortenant and geographic location in determining whether to invest in a property we focus on the following 1 the experience of the obligor’s management team 2 the historical and projected financial and operational performance of the property 3 the credit of the obligor 4 the security for the lease or loan and 5 the capital committed to the property by the obligor we conduct market research and analysis for all potential investments in addition we review the value of all properties the interest rates and covenant requirements of any debt to be assumed and the anticipated sources of repayment of any existing debt that is not to be assumed 

 

we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property and obligor our asset management process for investment properties generally includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each property periodic review of obligor creditworthiness periodic property inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure real estate taxes letters of credit and other collateral we actively manage and monitor substantially all of our medical office buildings’ performance with a comprehensive property management system including property management leasing and maintenance personnel employed by the company this property management system monitors tenant relations tenant expirations tenant mix of health service providers hospitalhealth system relationships property performance capital improvement needs and market conditions among other things in monitoring our portfolio our personnel use a proprietary database to collect and analyze propertyspecific data additionally we conduct extensive research to ascertain industry trends and risks 

 

through asset management and research we evaluate the operating environment in each property’s market to determine whether payment risk is likely to increase when we identify unacceptable levels of payment risk we seek to mitigate eliminate or transfer the risk we categorize the risk as obligor property or market risk for obligor risk we typically find a substitute operatortenant to run the property for property risk we usually work with the operatortenant to institute propertylevel management changes to address the risk finally for market risk we often encourage an obligor to change its capital structure including refinancing the property or raising additional equity through these asset management and research efforts we are generally able to intervene at an early stage to address payment risk and in so doing support both the collectability of revenue and the value of our investment 

 

depending upon market conditions we believe that new investments will be available in the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to our stockholders 

 

segment reporting 

 

our business consists of two business segments — investment properties and medical office buildings for additional information regarding business segments see note 19 to our audited consolidated financial statements 

 

investment properties 

 

real property our investment properties are those in which we do not participate in the management of the property and are primarily land building improvements and related rights that are leased to operators under longterm operating leases the net value of our investment properties excluding construction in progress aggregated approximately 3456430000 at december 31 2008 the leases generally have a fixed contractual term of 12 to 15 years and contain one or more five to 15year renewal options most of our rents are received under triplenet leases requiring the operator to pay rent and all additional charges incurred in the operation of the leased property the tenants are required to repair rebuild and maintain the leased properties substantially all of these operating 

leases are designed with either fixed or contingent escalating rent structures leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straightline basis over the initial lease period subject to a collectability assessment rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period 

 

at december 31 2008 85 of our investment properties were subject to master leases a master lease is a lease of multiple properties to one tenant entity under a single lease agreement from time to time we may acquire additional properties that are then leased to the tenant under the master lease the tenant is required to make one monthly payment that represents rent on all the properties that are subject to the master lease typically the master lease tenant can exercise its right to purchase the properties or to renew the master lease only with respect to all leased properties at the same time this bundling feature benefits us because the tenant cannot limit the purchase or renewal to the better performing properties and terminate the leasing arrangement with respect to the poorer performing properties this spreads our risk among the entire group of properties within the master lease the bundling feature may provide a similar advantage if the master lease tenant is in bankruptcy subject to certain restrictions a debtor in bankruptcy has the right to assume or reject each of its leases it is our intent that a tenant in bankruptcy would be required to assume or reject the master lease as a whole rather than deciding on a property by property basis 

 

construction we currently provide for the construction of properties for tenants as part of longterm operating leases we capitalize certain interest costs associated with funds used to pay for the construction of properties owned by us the amount capitalized is based upon the amount advanced during the construction period using the rate of interest that approximates our cost of financing our interest expense is reduced by the amount capitalized we also typically charge a transaction fee at the commencement of construction which we defer and amortize to income over the term of the resulting lease the construction period commences upon funding and terminates upon the earlier of the completion of the applicable property or the end of a specified period during the construction period we advance funds to the tenants in accordance with agreed upon terms and conditions which require among other things periodic site visits by a company representative during the construction period we generally require an additional credit enhancement in the form of payment and performance bonds andor completion guaranties at december 31 2008 we had outstanding construction investments of 542647000 and were committed to providing additional funds of approximately 617070000 to complete construction for investment properties 

 

real estate loans our real estate loans are typically structured to provide us with interest income principal amortization and transaction fees and are generally secured by a first second or third mortgage lien leasehold mortgage corporate guaranties andor personal guaranties at december 31 2008 we had outstanding real estate loans of 482885000 the interest yield averaged approximately 852 per annum on our outstanding real estate loan balances our yield on real estate loans depends upon a number of factors including the stated interest rate average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments the real estate loans outstanding at december 31 2008 are generally subject to three to 20year terms with principal amortization schedules andor balloon payments of the outstanding principal balances at the end of the term typically real estate loans are crossdefaulted and crosscollateralized with other real estate loans operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its affiliates 

 

medical office buildings 

 

our medical office buildings primarily consist of multitenant properties leased to health care providers management of these properties is provided by our management services group leases with our tenants are primarily triple net leases that require the tenants to pay their proportionate share of operating expenses other lease types with our tenants are gross or modified gross leases where all or a portion of our operating expenses are not reimbursed by tenants accordingly we incur certain property operating expenses such as real estate taxes repairs and maintenance utilities and insurance at december 31 2008 83 of our medical office building leases were triple net as compared to 4 gross and 13 modified gross leases substantially all of our leases at medical office buildings include annual base rent escalation clauses that are either predetermined fixed increases or are a function of an inflation index and typically have an initial term ranging from one to 20 years with a weighted average remaining term of approximately five years as of december 31 2008 operating property leases are normally credit 

enhanced by guaranties andor letters of credit the net value of our medical office buildings excluding construction in progress aggregated approximately 1282945000 at december 31 2008 we also had outstanding construction investments of 96772000 and expected to provide additional funds of approximately 112208000 to complete construction for medical office buildings 

 

development services group 

 

through our subsidiary hcn development services group inc “dsg” we develop quality specialty medical properties formerly known as hospital affiliates development corporation or “hadc” dsg develops and constructs new “buildtosuit” and multitenant facilities for us and in some instances for third parties who are expected to develop longterm relationships with the company dsg provides services such as property development facility and medical equipment planning and implementation services to healthcare services physician groups and third party medical property owners 

 

equity investments 

 

equity investments at december 31 2008 and 2007 include an investment in a public company that has a readily determinable fair market value we classify this equity investment as availableforsale and accordingly record this investment at its fair market value with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income a separate component of stockholders’ equity additionally equity investments at december 31 2008 include an investment in a private company we do not have the ability to exercise influence over the company so the investment was accounted for under the cost method under the cost method of accounting investments in private companies are carried at cost and are adjusted only for otherthantemporary declines in fair value return of capital and additional investments these equity investments represented a minimal ownership interest in these companies 

 

borrowing policies 

 

we utilize a combination of debt and equity to fund the purchase of new properties and to provide loan financing our debt and equity levels are determined by management to maintain a conservative credit profile generally we intend to issue unsecured fixed rate public debt with longterm maturities to approximate the maturities on our leases and loans for shortterm purposes we may borrow on our unsecured line of credit arrangement we replace these borrowings with longterm capital such as senior unsecured notes common stock or preferred stock when terms are deemed favorable we may invest in properties subject to existing mortgage indebtedness in addition we may obtain secured financing for unleveraged properties in which we have invested or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis it is our intent to limit secured indebtedness in our agreements with our lenders we are subject to restrictions with respect to secured and unsecured indebtedness 

 

competition 

 

we compete with other real estate investment trusts real estate partnerships private equity and hedge fund investors banks insurance companies financeinvestment companies governmentsponsored agencies taxable and taxexempt bond funds health care operators developers and other investors in the acquisition development leasing and financing of health care and senior housing properties some of our competitors are larger with greater resources and lower costs of capital than us increased competition inhibits our ability to identify and successfully complete investments we compete for investments based on a number of factors including rates financings offered underwriting criteria and reputation our ability to successfully compete is also impacted by economic and population trends availability of acceptable investment opportunities our ability to negotiate beneficial investment terms availability and cost of capital construction and renovation costs and new and existing laws and regulations 

 

the operatorstenants of our properties compete on a local and regional basis with operatorstenants of properties that provide comparable services operatorstenants compete for patients and residents based on a number of factors including quality of care reputation physical appearance of properties services offered family preferences physicians staff and price we also face competition from other health care facilities for tenants such as physicians and other health care providers that provide comparable facilities and services

we invest in assisted living skilled nursing independent livingcontinuing care retirement communities medical office buildings and specialty care facilities which represented approximately 20 27 19 23 and 11 respectively of our investments at december 31 2008 

 

typically operators of assisted living and independent living facilities do not receive significant funding from governmental programs and are regulated by the states not the federal government operators of skilled nursing and specialty care facilities do receive significant funding from governmental programs and are subject to federal and state laws that regulate the type and quality of the medical andor nursing care provided ancillary services eg respiratory occupational physical and infusion therapies qualifications of the administrative personnel and 

nursing staff the adequacy of the physical plant and equipment distribution of pharmaceuticals reimbursement and rate setting and operating policies in addition as described below a number of our property operators are subject to extensive laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including kickbacks physician selfreferrals and false claims hospitals physician group practice clinics and other health care facilities in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal state and local licensure certification and inspection laws and regulations our tenants’ failure to comply with any of these laws could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension or decertification or exclusion from federal and state health care programs loss of license or closure of the facility 

 

licensing and certification 

 

the primary regulations that affect assisted living facilities are the states’ licensing laws in granting and renewing these licenses the regulatory authorities consider numerous factors relating to a property’s physical plant and operations including but not limited to admission and discharge standards and staffing and training a decision to grant or renew a license is also affected by a property’s record with respect to patient and consumer rights and medication guidelines and rules certain of the senior housing facilities mortgaged to or owned by us may require the resident to pay an entrance or upfront fee a portion of which may be refundable these entrance fee communities are subject to significant state regulatory oversight including for example oversight of each facility’s financial condition establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial restrictions the right of residents to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time lien rights in favor of residents restrictions on change of ownership and similar matters such oversight and the rights of residents within these entrance fee communities may have an effect on the revenue or operations of the operators of such facilities and therefore may adversely affect us 

 

skilled nursing facilities are subject to a variety of licensure and certificate of need “con” laws and regulations con laws in those states that have them generally require a facility to demonstrate the need for constructing a new facility expanding an existing facility changing the ownership or control of an existing licensed facility or terminating services that have been approved through the con process cons where applicable generally are required before a covered facility can construct a new facility add beds or expand services invest in major capital equipment or add new services or terminate services for which the facility has previously been awarded a con and a license the con laws and regulations may restrict the ability of operators to add new properties or expand an existing facility’s size or services in addition con laws may constrain the ability of an operator to transfer responsibility for operating a particular facility to a new operator if we have to replace a barred property operator as discussed below our ability to replace the operator may be affected by con rules and policies governing changes in control 

 

with respect to licensure generally our skilled nursing and specialty care facilities are required to be licensed and certified for participation in the medicare and medicaid programs this generally requires license renewals and compliance surveys on an annual or biannual basis the failure of our operators to maintain or renew any required license or regulatory approval or the failure to correct serious survey deficiencies identified in compliance surveys could prevent them from continuing operations at a property in addition if a property is found out of compliance with the conditions of participation in medicare medicaid or other health care programs the property may be barred from participation in government reimbursement programs any of these occurrences may impair the ability of our operators to meet their obligations to us if we have to replace a barred property operator our ability to replace the operator may be affected by federal and state rules and policies governing changes in control this may result in payment delays an inability to find a replacement operator a significant working capital commitment from us to a new operator or other difficulties 

 

reimbursement 

 

assisted living facilities approximately 22 of our rental revenues for the year ended december 31 2008 were attributable to assisted living facilities the majority of the revenues received by the operators of our assisted living facilities are from private pay sources the remaining revenue source is primarily medicaid under certain waiver programs as a part of the omnibus budget reconciliation act “obra” of 1981 congress established a waiver program enabling some states to offer medicaid reimbursement to assisted living facilities as an alternative 

to institutional longterm care services the provisions of obra and the subsequent obra acts of 1987 and 1990 permit states to seek a waiver from typical medicaid requirements to develop costeffective alternatives to longterm care including medicaid payments for assisted living and home health at december 31 2008 six of our 23 assisted living operators received medicaid reimbursement pursuant to medicaid waiver programs for the twelve months ended september 30 2008 approximately 10 of the revenues at our assisted living facilities were from medicaid reimbursement there can be no guarantee that a state medicaid program operating pursuant to a waiver will be able to maintain its waiver status 

 

rates paid by selfpay residents are set by the facilities and are largely determined by local market conditions and operating costs generally facilities receive a higher payment per day for a private pay resident than for a medicaid beneficiary who requires a comparable level of care the level of medicaid reimbursement varies from state to state thus the revenues generated by operators of our assisted living facilities may be adversely affected by payor mix acuity level and changes in medicaid eligibility and reimbursement levels in addition a state could lose its medicaid waiver and no longer be permitted to utilize medicaid dollars to reimburse for assisted living services changes in revenues could in turn have a material adverse effect on an operator’s ability to meet its obligations to us 

 

skilled nursing facilities and specialty care facilities skilled nursing and specialty care facilities typically receive most of their revenues from medicare and medicaid with the balance representing private pay including private insurance consequently changes in federal or state reimbursement policies may also adversely affect an operator’s ability to cover its expenses including our rent or debt service skilled nursing and specialty care facilities are subject to periodic pre and postpayment reviews and other audits by federal and state authorities a review or audit of claims of a property operator could result in recoupments denials or delays of payments in the future which could have a material adverse effect on the operator’s ability to meet its obligations to us due to the significant judgments and estimates inherent in payor settlement accounting no assurance can be given as to the adequacy of any reserves maintained by our property operators for potential adjustments to reimbursements for payor settlements due to budgetary constraints governmental payors may limit or reduce payments to skilled nursing and specialty care facilities as a result of government reimbursement programs being subject to such budgetary pressures and legislative and administrative actions an operator’s ability to meet its obligations to us may be significantly impaired 

 

medicare reimbursement and skilled nursing facilities for the twelve months ended september 30 2008 approximately 30 of the revenues at our skilled nursing facilities which comprised 31 of our rental revenues for the year ended december 31 2008 were from medicare reimbursement skilled nursing facilities are reimbursed under the skilled nursing facility prospective payment system this type of reimbursement program puts facilities at risk to the extent that their costs exceed the fixed payments under the prospective payment system in addition there is a risk that payments under the prospective payment system may be set too low which could result in immediate financial difficulties for skilled nursing facilities and cause operators to seek bankruptcy protection skilled nursing facilities have had these types of difficulties since the implementation of the prospective payment system 

 

skilled nursing facilities received a 34 inflationary market basket increase in medicare payments for federal fiscal year 2009 which represents 780 million of additional medicare spending section 5008 of the deficit reduction act of 2005 directs the secretary as defined in that statute to conduct a demonstration program beginning january 1 2008 assessing the costs and outcomes of patients discharged from hospitals in a variety of postacute care settings including skilled nursing facilities the outcome of that demonstration program could lead to changes in medicare coverage and reimbursement for postacute care it is not known how either the demonstration program or any other changes in medicare reimbursement or regulatory obligations that might be proposed might impact tenants of the company’s properties 

 

the balanced budget act of 1997 mandated caps on medicare reimbursement for certain therapy services however congress imposed various moratoriums on the implementation of those caps the moratoriums on the therapy caps for part b outpatient rehabilitation services expired december 31 2005 the annual payment cap of 1810 per patient applies to occupational therapy and a separate 1810 cap applies to speech and physical therapy congress has permitted patients exceeding the cap to obtain additional medicare coverage through a waiver program if the therapy is deemed medically necessary the waiver program was most recently extended under the medicare improvements for patients and providers act of 2008 through december 31 2009 if the waiver is 

allowed to expire patients will need to use private funds to pay for the cost of therapy above the caps the waiver has historically been extended 

 

medicare reimbursement and specialty care facilities for the twelve months ended september 30 2008 approximately 43 of the revenues at our specialty care facilities which comprised 8 of our rental revenues for the year ended december 31 2008 were from medicare specialty care facilities generally are reimbursed by medicare under either the diagnosis related group prospective payment system reimbursement methodology for inpatient hospitals or the longterm acute care hospital prospective payment system for longterm acute care hospitals or the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system acute care hospitals provide a wide range of inpatient and outpatient services including but not limited to surgery rehabilitation therapy and clinical laboratories longterm acute care hospitals provide inpatient services for patients with complex medical conditions that require more intensive care monitoring or emergency support than that available in most skilled nursing facilities inpatient rehabilitation facilities provide intensive rehabilitation services in an inpatient setting for patients requiring at least three hours of rehabilitation services a day 

 

with respect to medicare’s diagnosis related groupoutpatient prospective payment system methodology for regular hospitals reimbursement for inpatient services is made on the basis of a fixed prospective rate based on the principal diagnosis of the patient hospitals are at risk to the extent that their costs in treating a specific case exceed the fixed payment the diagnosis related group reimbursement system was changed in 2008 with the expansion of diagnosis groups from 538 to 745 diagnosis related groups to greater reflect severity it is possible that this change in the drg system will adversely impact reimbursement for some of our hospitals in some cases a hospital might be able to qualify for an outlier payment if the hospital’s losses exceed a threshold 

 

medicaid reimbursement medicaid is a major payor source for residents in our skilled nursing and specialty care facilities for the twelve months ended september 30 2008 approximately 51 of the revenues of our skilled nursing facilities and 19 of the revenues of our specialty care facilities were attributable to medicaid payments the federal government and the states share responsibility for financing medicaid the federal matching rate known as the federal medical assistance percentage varies by state based on relative per capita income but is at least 50 in all states on average medicaid is the largest component of total state spending representing approximately 21 of total state spending the percentage of medicaid dollars used for longterm care varies from state to state due in part to different ratios of elderly population and eligibility requirements within certain federal guidelines states have a wide range of discretion to determine eligibility and reimbursement methodology many states reimburse longterm care facilities using fixed daily rates which are applied prospectively based on patient acuity and the historical costs incurred in providing patient care reasonable costs typically include allowances for staffing administrative and general and property and equipment eg real estate taxes depreciation and fair rental 

 

in most states medicaid does not fully reimburse the cost of providing skilled nursing services certain states are attempting to slow the rate of growth in medicaid expenditures by freezing rates or restricting eligibility and benefits at the beginning of their respective fiscal years states in which we have skilled nursing property investments increased their per diem medicaid rates roughly 17 on average for fiscal year 2009 and seven of our states effectively froze rates which will impact profitability to the extent that expenses continue to rise our skilled nursing portfolio’s average medicaid rate will likely vary throughout the year as states continue to make interim changes to their budgets and medicaid funding in addition medicaid rates may decline if revenues in a particular state are not sufficient to fund budgeted expenditures 

 

the medicare part d drug benefit became effective january 1 2006 nursing home residents dually eligible for medicare and enrolled in one of the new part d plans and medicaid may now enroll and receive reimbursement for drugs through medicare part d rather than through medicaid part d will result in increased administrative responsibilities for nursing home operators because enrollment in part d is voluntary and residents have the choice of multiple prescription drug plans operators may also experience increased expenses to the extent that patients’ specific prescribed drugs may not be on the part d drug plan formulary for the plan in which specific patients are enrolled 

 

the reimbursement methodologies applied to health care facilities continue to evolve federal and state authorities have considered and may seek to implement new or modified reimbursement methodologies that may 

negatively impact health care property operations the impact of any such change if implemented may result in a material adverse effect on our skilled nursing and specialty care property operations no assurance can be given that current revenue sources or levels will be maintained accordingly there can be no assurance that payments under a government reimbursement program are currently or will be in the future sufficient to fully reimburse the property operators for their operating and capital expenses as a result an operator’s ability to meet its obligations to us could be adversely impacted 

 

recent developments the american reinvestment and recovery act of 2009 was passed february 17 2009 between october 1 2008 and december 31 2010 the bill will provide nearly 87 billion in additional federal medicaid funding for states each state will receive a 62 percentage point increase in their federal medical assistance percentage fmap thus lowering the state’s share of the cost through 2010 the remaining 35 of the 87 billion will be allocated to states with higher unemployment rates in order to receive funding states must maintain eligibility levels for medicaid that were previously in place the passage of this bill and distribution of funds should relieve some of the budgetary pressures that many states currently face this increased federal funding should help prevent state cuts to provider medicaid rates 

 

other related laws 

 

skilled nursing and specialty care facilities and assisted living facilities that receive medicaid payments are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations that govern the operations and financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by health care providers certain of these laws prohibit direct or indirect payments of any kind for the purpose of inducing or encouraging the referral of patients for medical products or services reimbursable by governmental programs other laws require providers to furnish only medically necessary services and submit to the government valid and accurate statements for each service still other laws require providers to comply with a variety of safety health and other requirements relating to the condition of the licensed property and the quality of care provided sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations may include but are not limited to criminal andor civil penalties and fines and a loss of licensure immediate termination of governmental payments and exclusion from eligibility for any governmental reimbursement in certain circumstances violation of these rules such as those prohibiting abusive and fraudulent behavior with respect to one property may subject other facilities under common control or ownership to sanctions including exclusion from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs in the ordinary course of its business a property operator is regularly subjected to inquiries investigations and audits by federal and state agencies that oversee these laws and regulations 

 

each skilled nursing and specialty care property and any assisted living property that receives medicaid payments is subject to the federal antikickback statute that generally prohibits persons from offering providing soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing of a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal health care program such as the medicare and medicaid programs skilled nursing and specialty care facilities are also subject to the federal ethics in patient referral act of 1989 commonly referred to as the stark law the stark law generally prohibits the submission of claims to medicare for payment if the claim results from a physician referral for certain designated services and the physician has a financial relationship with the health service provider that does not qualify under one of the exceptions for a financial relationship under the stark law similar prohibitions on physician selfreferrals and submission of claims apply to state medicaid programs further skilled nursing and specialty care facilities and assisted living facilities that receive medicaid payments are subject to substantial financial penalties under the civil monetary penalties act and the false claims act and in particular actions under the false claims act’s “whistleblower” provisions private enforcement of health care fraud has increased due in large part to amendments to the false claims act that encourage private individuals to sue on behalf of the government these whistleblower suits by private individuals known as qui tam actions may be filed by almost anyone including present and former patients nurses and other employees some cases have been brought under the federal false claims act asserting claims for treble damages and up to 11000 per claim on the basis of the alleged failure of a nursing facility to meet applicable regulations relating to the operation of the nursing facility prosecutions investigations or whistle blower actions could have a material adverse effect on a property operator’s liquidity financial condition and results of operations which could adversely affect the ability of the operator to meet its obligations to us finally various state false claim and anti 

kickback laws also may apply to each property operator violation of any of the foregoing statutes can result in criminal andor civil penalties that could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its obligations to us 

 

other legislative developments over the past several years including the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” have greatly expanded the definition of health care fraud and related offenses and broadened its scope to include private health care plans in addition to government payors congress also has greatly increased funding for the department of justice federal bureau of investigation and the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services to audit investigate and prosecute suspected health care fraud moreover a significant portion of the billions in health care fraud recoveries over the past several years has also been returned to government agencies to further fund their fraud investigation and prosecution efforts 

 

additionally other hipaa provisions and regulations provide for communication of health information through standard electronic transaction formats and for the privacy and security of health information in order to comply with the regulations health care providers must undergo significant operational and technical changes operators also face significant financial exposure if they fail to maintain the confidentiality of medical records and personal identifiable health information about individuals 

 

in november 2002 the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms an agency of the us department of health and human services began a national nursing home quality initiative nhqi under this initiative historical survey information the nhqi pilot evaluation report and the nhqi overview is made available to the public online the nhqi website provides consumer and provider information regarding the quality of care in nursing homes the data allows consumers providers states and researchers to compare quality information that shows how well nursing homes are caring for their residents’ physical and clinical needs the posted nursing home quality measures come from resident assessment data that nursing homes routinely collect on the residents at specified intervals during their stay if the operators of nursing facilities are unable to achieve quality of care ratings that are comparable or superior to those of their competitors they may lose market share to other facilities reducing their revenues and adversely impacting their ability to make rental payments 

 

finally government investigation and enforcement of health care laws has increased dramatically over the past several years and is expected to continue some of these enforcement actions represent novel legal theories and expansions in the application of false claims laws the costs for an operator of a health care property associated with both defending such enforcement actions and the undertakings in settlement agreements can be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its obligations to us 

 

environmental laws 

 

a wide variety of federal state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect health care facility operations or special medical properties under various federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations an owner of real property or a secured lender such as the company may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at under or disposed of in connection with such property as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property the cost of any required remediation removal fines or personal or property damages and the owner’s or secured lender’s liability for such costs could exceed the value of the property andor the assets of the owner or secured lender in addition the presence of such substances or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which in turn would reduce revenues

if we acquire any assets from a corporation which is or has been a “c” corporation in a carryover basis transaction we could be liable for specified liabilities that are inherited from the “c” corporation a “c” corporation is generally defined as a corporation that is required to pay full corporate level federal income tax if we recognize gain on the disposition of the assets during the tenyear period beginning on the date on which the assets were acquired by us then to the extent of the assets’ “builtin gain” ie the excess of the fair market value of the asset over the adjusted tax basis in the asset in each case determined as of the beginning of the tenyear period we will be subject to tax on the gain at the highest regular corporate rate applicable the results described in this paragraph with respect to the recognition of builtin gain assume that the builtin gain assets at the time the builtin gain assets were subject to a conversion transaction either where a “c” corporation elected reit status or a reit acquired the assets from a “c” corporation were not treated as sold to an unrelated party and gain recognized 

 

qualification as a reit 

 

a reit is defined as a corporation trust or association 

 

  

conditions 1 to 4 inclusive must be met during the entire taxable year and condition 5 must be met during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months for purposes of conditions 5 and 6 pension funds and certain other taxexempt entities are treated as individuals subject to a “lookthrough” exception in the case of condition 6 

 

based on publicly available information we believe we have satisfied the share ownership requirements set forth in 5 and 6 above in addition article vi of our amended and restated bylaws provides for restrictions regarding ownership and transfer of shares these restrictions are intended to assist us in continuing to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in 5 and 6 above these restrictions however may not ensure that we will in all cases be able to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in 5 and 6 above 

 

we have complied with and will continue to comply with regulatory rules to send annual letters to certain of our stockholders requesting information regarding the actual ownership of our stock if despite sending the annual letters we do not know or after exercising reasonable diligence would not have known whether we failed to meet the five or fewer requirement we will be treated as having met the five or fewer requirement if we fail to comply with these regulatory rules we will be subject to a monetary penalty if our failure to comply was due to 

intentional disregard of the requirement the penalty would be increased however if our failure to comply were due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect no penalty would be imposed 

 

we may own a number of properties through wholly owned subsidiaries a corporation will qualify as a “qualified reit subsidiary” if 100 of its stock is owned by a reit and the reit does not elect to treat the subsidiary as a taxable reit subsidiary a “qualified reit subsidiary” will not be treated as a separate corporation and all assets liabilities and items of income deductions and credits of a “qualified reit subsidiary” will be treated as assets liabilities and items as the case may be of the reit a “qualified reit subsidiary” is not subject to federal income tax and our ownership of the voting stock of a qualified reit subsidiary will not violate the restrictions against ownership of securities of any one issuer which constitute more than 10 of the value or total voting power of such issuer or more than 5 of the value of our total assets as described below under “— asset tests” 

 

if we invest in a partnership a limited liability company or a trust taxed as a partnership or as a disregarded entity we will be deemed to own a proportionate share of the partnership’s limited liability company’s or trust’s assets likewise we will be treated as receiving our share of the income and loss of the partnership limited liability company or trust and the gross income will retain the same character in our hands as it has in the hands of the partnership limited liability company or trust these “lookthrough” rules apply for purposes of the income tests and assets tests described below 

 

income tests there are two separate percentage tests relating to our sources of gross income that we must satisfy for each taxable year 

 

  

for taxable years beginning on or before october 22 2004 1 payments to us under an interest rate swap or cap agreement option futures contract forward rate agreement or any similar financial instrument entered into by us to reduce interest rate risk on indebtedness incurred or to be incurred and 2 gain from the sale or other disposition of any such investment are treated as income qualifying under the 95 gross income test as to transactions entered into in taxable years beginning after october 22 2004 any of our income from a “clearly identified” hedging transaction that is entered into by us in the normal course of business directly or indirectly to manage the risk of interest rate movements price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings or obligations incurred or to be incurred by us or such other risks that are prescribed by the internal revenue service is excluded from the 95 gross income test 

 

for transactions entered into after july 30 2008 any of our income from a “clearly identified” hedging transaction that is entered into by us in the normal course of business directly or indirectly to manage the risk of interest rate movements price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings or obligations incurred or to be incurred by us is excluded from the 95 and 75 gross income tests 

 

for transactions entered into after july 30 2008 any of our income from a “clearly identified” hedging transaction entered into by us primarily to manage risk of currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain that is included in gross income in the 95 and 75 gross income tests is excluded from the 95 and 75 gross income tests 

 

in general a hedging transaction is “clearly identified” if 1 the transaction is identified as a hedging transaction before the end of the day on which it is entered into and 2 the items or risks being hedged are identified “substantially contemporaneously” with the hedging transaction an identification is not substantially contemporaneous if it is made more than 35 days after entering into the hedging transaction 

 

as to gains and items of income recognized after july 30 2008 “passive foreign exchange gain” for any taxable year will not constitute gross income for purposes of the 95 gross income test and “real estate foreign 

exchange gain” for any taxable year will not constitute gross income for purposes of the 75 gross income test real estate foreign exchange gain is foreign currency gain as defined in internal revenue code section 988b1 which is attributable to i any qualifying item of income or gain for purposes of the 75 gross income test ii the acquisition or ownership of obligations secured by mortgages on real property or interests in real property or iii becoming or being the obligor under obligations secured by mortgages on real property or on interests in real property real estate foreign exchange gain also includes internal revenue code section 987 gain attributable to a qualified business unit a “qbu” of a reit if the qbu itself meets the 75 income test for the taxable year and the 75 asset test at the close of each quarter that the reit has directly or indirectly held the qbu real estate foreign exchange gain also includes any other foreign currency gain as determined by the secretary of the treasury passive foreign exchange gain includes all real estate foreign exchange gain and foreign currency gain which is attributable to i any qualifying item of income or gain for purposes of the 95 gross income test ii the acquisition or ownership of obligations iii becoming or being the obligor under obligations and iv any other foreign currency gain as determined by the secretary of the treasury 

 

generally other than income from “clearly identified” hedging transactions entered into by us in the normal course of business any foreign currency gain derived by us from dealing or engaging in substantial and regular trading in securities will constitute gross income which does not qualify under the 95 or 75 gross income tests 

 

rents received by us will qualify as “rents from real property” for purposes of satisfying the gross income tests for a reit only if several conditions are met 

 

  

for taxable years beginning after august 5 1997 a reit has been permitted to render a de minimis amount of impermissible services to tenants and still treat amounts received with respect to that property as rent from real property the amount received or accrued by the reit during the taxable year for the impermissible services with respect to a property may not exceed 1 of all amounts received or accrued by the reit directly or indirectly from the property the amount received for any service or management operation for this purpose shall be deemed to be not less than 150 of the direct cost of the reit in furnishing or rendering the service or providing the management or operation furthermore impermissible services may be furnished to tenants by a taxable reit subsidiary subject to certain conditions and we may still treat rents received with respect to the property as rent from real property 

the term “interest” generally does not include any amount if the determination of the amount depends in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person although an amount generally will not be excluded from the term “interest” solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage of receipts or sales 

 

if we fail to satisfy one or both of the 75 or 95 gross income tests for any taxable year we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for such year if we are eligible for relief for taxable years beginning on or before october 22 2004 these relief provisions generally will be available if 1 our failure to meet such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect 2 we attach a schedule of the sources of our income to our return and 3 any incorrect information on the schedule was not due to fraud with intent to evade tax for taxable years beginning after october 22 2004 these relief provisions generally will be available if 1 following our identification of the failure we file a schedule for such taxable year describing each item of our gross income and 2 the failure to meet such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect 

 

it is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions if these relief provisions apply a 100 tax is imposed on an amount equal to a the gross income attributable to 1 75 of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75 income test and 2 95 of our gross income 90 of our gross income for taxable years beginning on or before october 22 2004 over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 95 income test multiplied by b a fraction intended to reflect our profitability 

 

the secretary of the treasury is given broad authority to determine whether particular items of income or gain qualify or not under the 75 and 95 gross income tests or are to be excluded from the measure of gross income for such purposes 

 

asset tests within 30 days after the close of each quarter of our taxable year we must also satisfy several tests relating to the nature and diversification of our assets determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles at least 75 of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets cash cash items including receivables arising in the ordinary course of our operation government securities and qualified temporary investments although the remaining 25 of our assets generally may be invested without restriction we are prohibited from owning securities representing more than 10 of either the vote the “10 vote test” or value the “10 value test” of the outstanding securities of any issuer other than a qualified reit subsidiary another reit or a taxable reit subsidiary further no more than 20 25 for taxable years after 2008 of the total assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries the “20 asset test” the “25 asset test” for taxable years after 2008 and no more than 5 of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities of any nongovernmental issuer other than a qualified reit subsidiary the “5 asset test” another reit or a taxable reit subsidiary each of the 10 vote test the 10 value test and the 20 25 for taxable years after 2008 and 5 asset tests must be satisfied at the end of each quarter there are special rules which provide relief if the value related tests are not satisfied due to changes in the value of the assets of a reit 

 

for taxable years beginning after december 31 2000 certain items are excluded from the 10 value test including 1 straight debt securities of an issuer including straight debt that provides certain contingent payments 2 any loan to an individual or an estate 3 any rental agreement described in section 467 of the internal revenue code other than with a “related person” 4 any obligation to pay rents from real property 5 certain securities issued by a state or any subdivision thereof the district of columbia a foreign government or any political subdivision thereof or the commonwealth of puerto rico 6 any security issued by a reit and 7 any other arrangement that as determined by the secretary of the treasury is excepted from the definition of security “excluded securities” special rules apply to straight debt securities issued by corporations and entities taxable as partnerships for federal income tax purposes if a reit or its taxable reit subsidiary holds 1 straight debt securities of a corporate or partnership issuer and 2 securities of such issuer that are not excluded securities and have an aggregate value greater than 1 of such issuer’s outstanding securities the straight debt securities will be included in the 10 value test 

 

for taxable years beginning after december 31 2000 a reit’s interest as a partner in a partnership is not treated as a security for purposes of applying the 10 value test to securities issued by the partnership further any debt instrument issued by a partnership will not be a security for purposes of applying the 10 value test 1 to the extent of the reit’s interest as a partner in the partnership and 2 if at least 75 of the partnership’s gross income 

excluding gross income from prohibited transactions would qualify for the 75 gross income test for taxable years beginning after october 22 2004 for purposes of the 10 value test a reit’s interest in a partnership’s assets is determined by the reit’s proportionate interest in any securities issued by the partnership other than the excluded securities described in the preceding paragraph 

 

for taxable years beginning after july 30 2008 if the reit or its qbu uses a foreign currency as its functional currency the term “cash” includes such foreign currency but only to the extent such foreign currency is i held for use in the normal course of the activities of the reit or qbu which give rise to items of income or gain that are included in the 95 and 75 gross income tests or are directly related to acquiring or holding assets qualifying under the 75 asset test and ii not held in connection with dealing or engaging in substantial and regular trading in securities 

 

with respect to corrections of failures for which the requirements for corrections are satisfied after october 22 2004 regardless of whether such failures occurred in taxable years beginning on before or after such date as to violations of the 10 vote test the 10 value test or the 5 asset test a reit may avoid disqualification as a reit by disposing of sufficient assets to cure a violation that does not exceed the lesser of 1 of the reit’s assets at the end of the relevant quarter or 10000000 provided that the disposition occurs within six months following the last day of the quarter in which the reit first identified the assets for violations of any of the reit asset tests due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that exceed the thresholds described in the preceding sentence a reit can avoid disqualification as a reit after the close of a taxable quarter by taking certain steps including disposition of sufficient assets within the six month period described above to meet the applicable asset test paying a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets during the period of time that the assets were held as nonqualifying assets and filing a schedule with the internal revenue service that describes the nonqualifying assets 

 

investments in taxable reit subsidiaries for taxable years beginning after december 31 2000 reits may own more than 10 of the voting power and value of securities in taxable reit subsidiaries we and any taxable corporate entity in which we own an interest are allowed to jointly elect to treat such entity as a “taxable reit subsidiary” 

 

certain of our subsidiaries have elected to be treated as a taxable reit subsidiary taxable reit subsidiaries are subject to full corporate level federal taxation on their earnings but are permitted to engage in certain types of activities that cannot be performed directly by reits without jeopardizing their reit status our taxable reit subsidiaries will attempt to minimize the amount of these taxes but there can be no assurance whether or the extent to which measures taken to minimize taxes will be successful to the extent our taxable reit subsidiaries are required to pay federal state or local taxes the cash available for distribution as dividends to us from our taxable reit subsidiaries will be reduced 

 

the amount of interest on relatedparty debt that a taxable reit subsidiary may deduct is limited further a 100 tax applies to any interest payments by a taxable reit subsidiary to its affiliated reit to the extent the interest rate is not commercially reasonable a taxable reit subsidiary is permitted to deduct interest payments to unrelated parties without any of these restrictions 

 

the internal revenue service may reallocate costs between a reit and its taxable reit subsidiary where there is a lack of arm’slength dealing between the parties any deductible expenses allocated away from a taxable reit subsidiary would increase its tax liability further any amount by which a reit understates its deductions and overstates those of its taxable reit subsidiary will subject to certain exceptions be subject to a 100 tax additional taxable reit subsidiary elections may be made in the future for additional entities in which we own an interest 

 

annual distribution requirements in order to avoid being taxed as a regular corporation we are required to make distributions other than capital gain distributions to our stockholders which qualify for the dividends paid deduction in an amount at least equal to 1 the sum of i 90 of our “reit taxable income” computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain and ii 90 of the aftertax net income if any from foreclosure property minus 2 a portion of certain items of noncash income these distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return 

for that year and if paid on or before the first regular distribution payment after such declaration the amount distributed must not be preferential this means that every stockholder of the class of stock to which a distribution is made must be treated the same as every other stockholder of that class and no class of stock may be treated otherwise than in accordance with its dividend rights as a class to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our “reit taxable income” as adjusted we will be subject to tax on the undistributed amount at regular corporate tax rates finally as discussed above we may be subject to an excise tax if we fail to meet certain other distribution requirements we intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy these annual distribution requirements 

 

it is possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90 distribution requirement or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation due to among other things 1 timing differences between i the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses and ii the inclusion of income and deduction of expenses in arriving at our taxable income or 2 the payment of severance benefits that may not be deductible to us in the event that timing differences occur we may find it necessary to arrange for borrowings or if possible pay dividends in the form of taxable stock dividends in order to meet the distribution requirement 

 

under certain circumstances in the event of a deficiency determined by the internal revenue service we may be able to rectify a resulting failure to meet the distribution requirement for a year by paying “deficiency dividends” to stockholders in a later year which may be included in our deduction for distributions paid for the earlier year thus we may be able to avoid being taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends however we will be required to pay applicable penalties and interest based upon the amount of any deduction taken for deficiency dividend distributions 

 

the internal revenue service recently issued revenue procedure 200868 which provides temporary relief to publicly traded reits seeking to preserve liquidity by electing cashstock dividends under revenue procedure 200868 a reit may treat the entire dividend including the stock portion as a taxable dividend distribution thereby qualifying for the dividendspaid deduction provided certain requirements are satisfied the cash portion of the dividend may be as low as 10 the revenue procedure applies to dividends declared on or after january 1 2008 and with respect to a taxable year ending on or before december 31 2009 

 

failure to qualify as a reit 

 

if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates distributions to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify as a reit will not be deductible nor will any particular amount of distributions be required to be made in any year all distributions to stockholders will be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these distributions and subject to certain limitations will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporate stockholders unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions we also will be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to statutory relief failure to qualify for even one year could result in our need to incur indebtedness or liquidate investments in order to pay potentially significant resulting tax liabilities 

 

in addition to the relief described above under “— income tests” and “— asset tests” relief is available in the event that we violate a provision of the internal revenue code that would result in our failure to qualify as a reit if 1 the violation is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect 2 we pay a penalty of 50000 for each failure to satisfy the provision and 3 the violation does not include a violation described under ‘‘— income tests” or “— asset tests” above it is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions 

 

federal income taxation of holders of our stock 

 

treatment of taxable us stockholders the following summary applies to you only if you are a “us stockholder” a “us stockholder” is a holder of shares of stock who for united states federal income tax purposes is 

 

 20 

 

  

so long as we qualify for taxation as a reit distributions on shares of our stock made out of the current or accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these distributions and not designated as capital gain dividends will be includable as ordinary income for federal income tax purposes none of these distributions will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for us corporate stockholders 

 

generally for taxable years ending after may 6 2003 through december 31 2010 the maximum marginal rate of tax payable by individuals on dividends received from corporations that are subject to a corporate level of tax is 15 except in limited circumstances this tax rate will not apply to dividends paid to you by us on our shares because generally we are not subject to federal income tax on the portion of our reit taxable income or capital gains distributed to our stockholders the reduced maximum federal income tax rate will apply to that portion if any of dividends received by you with respect to our shares that are attributable to 1 dividends received by us from nonreit corporations or other taxable reit subsidiaries 2 income from the prior year with respect to which we were required to pay federal corporate income tax during the prior year if for example we did not distribute 100 of our reit taxable income for the prior year or 3 the amount of any earnings and profits that were distributed by us and accumulated in a nonreit year 

 

distributions that are designated as capital gain dividends will be taxed as longterm capital gains to the extent they do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year without regard to the period for which you held our stock however if you are a corporation you may be required to treat a portion of some capital gain dividends as ordinary income 

 

if we elect to retain and pay income tax on any net longterm capital gain you would include in income as longterm capital gain your proportionate share of this net longterm capital gain you would also receive a refundable tax credit for your proportionate share of the tax paid by us on such retained capital gains and you would have an increase in the basis of your shares of our stock in an amount equal to your includable capital gains less your share of the tax deemed paid 

 

you may not include in your federal income tax return any of our net operating losses or capital losses federal income tax rules may also require that certain minimum tax adjustments and preferences be apportioned to you in addition any distribution declared by us in october november or december of any year on a specified date in any such month shall be treated as both paid by us and received by you on december 31 of that year provided that the distribution is actually paid by us no later than january 31 of the following year 

 

we will be treated as having sufficient earnings and profits to treat as a dividend any distribution up to the amount required to be distributed in order to avoid imposition of the 4 excise tax discussed under “— general” and “— qualification as a reit — annual distribution requirements” above as a result you may be required to treat as taxable dividends certain distributions that would otherwise result in a taxfree return of capital moreover any “deficiency dividend” will be treated as a dividend an ordinary dividend or a capital gain dividend as the case may be regardless of our earnings and profits any other distributions in excess of current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to you to the extent these distributions do not exceed the adjusted tax basis of your shares of our stock you will be required to reduce the tax basis of your shares of our stock by the amount of these distributions until the basis has been reduced to zero after which these distributions will be taxable as capital gain if the shares of our stock are held as capital assets the tax basis as so reduced will be used in computing the capital gain or loss if any realized upon sale of the shares of our stock any loss upon a sale or exchange of shares of our stock which were held for six months or less after application of certain holding period rules will generally be treated as a longterm capital loss to the extent you previously received capital gain distributions with respect to these shares of our stock 

upon the sale or exchange of any shares of our stock to or with a person other than us or a sale or exchange of all shares of our stock whether actually or constructively owned with us you will generally recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your adjusted tax basis in these shares of our stock this gain will be capital gain if you held these shares of our stock as a capital asset 

 

if we redeem any of your shares in us the treatment can only be determined on the basis of particular facts at the time of redemption in general you will recognize gain or loss as opposed to dividend income equal to the difference between the amount received by you in the redemption and your adjusted tax basis in your shares redeemed if such redemption 1 results in a “complete termination” of your interest in all classes of our equity securities 2 is a “substantially disproportionate redemption” or 3 is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” with respect to you in applying these tests you must take into account your ownership of all classes of our equity securities eg common stock preferred stock depositary shares and warrants you also must take into account any equity securities that are considered to be constructively owned by you 

 

if as a result of a redemption by us of your shares you no longer own either actually or constructively any of our equity securities or only own actually and constructively an insubstantial percentage of our equity securities then it is probable that the redemption of your shares would be considered “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” and thus would result in gain or loss to you however whether a distribution is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” depends on all of the facts and circumstances and if you rely on any of these tests at the time of redemption you should consult your tax advisor to determine their application to the particular situation 

 

generally if the redemption does not meet the tests described above then the proceeds received by you from the redemption of your shares will be treated as a distribution taxable as a dividend to the extent of the allocable portion of current or accumulated earnings and profits if the redemption is taxed as a dividend your adjusted tax basis in the redeemed shares will be transferred to any other shareholdings in us that you own if you own no other shareholdings in us under certain circumstances such basis may be transferred to a related person or it may be lost entirely 

 

gain from the sale or exchange of our shares held for more than one year is taxed at a maximum longterm capital gain rate which is currently 15 pursuant to internal revenue service guidance we may classify portions of our capital gain dividends as gains eligible for the longterm capital gains rate or as gain taxable to individual stockholders at a maximum rate of 25 

 

treatment of taxexempt us stockholders taxexempt entities including qualified employee pension and profit sharing trusts and individual retirement accounts “exempt organizations” generally are exempt from federal income taxation however they are subject to taxation on their unrelated business taxable income “ubti” the internal revenue service has issued a published revenue ruling that dividend distributions from a reit to an exempt employee pension trust do not constitute ubti provided that the shares of the reit are not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business of the exempt employee pension trust based on this ruling amounts distributed by us to exempt organizations generally should not constitute ubti however if an exempt organization finances its acquisition of the shares of our stock with debt a portion of its income from us will constitute ubti pursuant to the “debt financed property” rules likewise a portion of the exempt organization’s income from us would constitute ubti if we held a residual interest in a real estate mortgage investment conduit 

 

in addition in certain circumstances a pension trust that owns more than 10 of our stock is required to treat a percentage of our dividends as ubti this rule applies to a pension trust holding more than 10 of our stock only if 1 the percentage of our income that is ubti determined as if we were a pension trust is at least 5 2 we qualify as a reit by reason of the modification of the five or fewer requirement that allows beneficiaries of the pension trust to be treated as holding shares in proportion to their actuarial interests in the pension trust and 3 either i one pension trust owns more than 25 of the value of our stock or ii a group of pension trusts individually holding more than 10 of the value of our stock collectively own more than 50 of the value of our stock 

 

backup withholding and information reporting under certain circumstances you may be subject to backup withholding at applicable rates on payments made with respect to or cash proceeds of a sale or exchange of shares of our stock backup withholding will apply only if you 1 fail to provide a correct taxpayer identification number 

which if you are an individual is ordinarily your social security number 2 furnish an incorrect taxpayer identification number 3 are notified by the internal revenue service that you have failed to properly report payments of interest or dividends or 4 fail to certify under penalties of perjury that you have furnished a correct taxpayer identification number and that the internal revenue service has not notified you that you are subject to backup withholding 

 

backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients such as corporations and taxexempt organizations you should consult with a tax advisor regarding qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining an exemption backup withholding is not an additional tax rather the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a stockholder will be allowed as a credit against such stockholder’s united states federal income tax liability and may entitle such stockholder to a refund provided that the required information is provided to the internal revenue service in addition withholding a portion of capital gain distributions made to stockholders may be required for stockholders who fail to certify their nonforeign status 

 

taxation of foreign stockholders the following summary applies to you only if you are a foreign person the federal taxation of foreign persons is a highly complex matter that may be affected by many considerations 

 

except as discussed below distributions to you of cash generated by our real estate operations in the form of ordinary dividends but not by the sale or exchange of our capital assets generally will be subject to us withholding tax at a rate of 30 unless an applicable tax treaty reduces that tax and you file with us the required form evidencing the lower rate 

 

in general you will be subject to united states federal income tax on a graduated rate basis rather than withholding with respect to your investment in our stock if such investment is “effectively connected” with your conduct of a trade or business in the united states a corporate foreign stockholder that receives income that is or is treated as effectively connected with a united states trade or business may also be subject to the branch profits tax which is payable in addition to regular united states corporate income tax the following discussion will apply to foreign stockholders whose investment in us is not so effectively connected we expect to withhold united states income tax as described below on the gross amount of any distributions paid to you unless 1 you file an internal revenue service form w8eci with us claiming that the distribution is “effectively connected” or 2 certain other exceptions apply 

 

distributions by us that are attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a united states real property interest will be taxed to you under the foreign investment in real property tax act of 1980 “firpta” as if these distributions were gains “effectively connected” with a united states trade or business accordingly you will be taxed at the normal capital gain rates applicable to a us stockholder on these amounts subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals distributions subject to firpta may also be subject to a branch profits tax in the hands of a corporate foreign stockholder that is not entitled to treaty exemption 

 

we will be required to withhold from distributions subject to firpta and remit to the internal revenue service 35 of designated capital gain dividends or if greater 35 of the amount of any distributions that could be designated as capital gain dividends in addition if we designate prior distributions as capital gain dividends subsequent distributions up to the amount of the prior distributions not withheld against will be treated as capital gain dividends for purposes of withholding 

 

for taxable years beginning after october 22 2004 any capital gain dividend with respect to any class of stock that is “regularly traded” on an established securities market will be treated as an ordinary dividend if the foreign stockholder did not own more than 5 of such class of stock at any time during the taxable year once this provision takes effect foreign stockholders generally will not be required to report distributions received from us on us federal income tax returns and all distributions treated as dividends for us federal income tax purposes including any capital gain dividend will be subject to a 30 us withholding tax unless reduced under an applicable income tax treaty as discussed above in addition the branch profits tax will no longer apply to such distributions 

unless our shares constitute a “united states real property interest” within the meaning of firpta or are effectively connected with a us trade or business a sale of our shares by you generally will not be subject to united states taxation our shares will not constitute a united states real property interest if we qualify as a “domestically controlled reit” we do and expect to continue to qualify as a domestically controlled reit a domestically controlled reit is a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50 in value of its shares is held directly or indirectly by foreign stockholders however if you are a nonresident alien individual who is present in the united states for 183 days or more during the taxable year and certain other conditions apply you will be subject to a 30 tax on such capital gains in any event a purchaser of our shares from you will not be required under firpta to withhold on the purchase price if the purchased shares are “regularly traded” on an established securities market or if we are a domestically controlled reit otherwise under firpta the purchaser may be required to withhold 10 of the purchase price and remit such amount to the internal revenue service 

 

backup withholding tax and information reporting will generally not apply to distributions paid to you outside the united states that are treated as 1 dividends to which the 30 or lower treaty rate withholding tax discussed above applies 2 capital gains dividends or 3 distributions attributable to gain from the sale or exchange by us of us real property interests payment of the proceeds of a sale of stock within the united states or conducted through certain us related financial intermediaries is subject to both backup withholding and information reporting unless the beneficial owner certifies under penalties of perjury that he or she is not a us person and the payor does not have actual knowledge that the beneficial owner is a us person or otherwise established an exemption you may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for refund with the internal revenue service 

 

us federal income taxation of holders of depositary shares 

 

owners of our depositary shares will be treated as if you were owners of the series of preferred stock represented by the depositary shares thus you will be required to take into account the income and deductions to which you would be entitled if you were a holder of the underlying series of preferred stock 

 

conversion or exchange of shares for preferred stock no gain or loss will be recognized upon the withdrawal of preferred stock in exchange for depositary shares and the tax basis of each share of preferred stock will upon exchange be the same as the aggregate tax basis of the depositary shares exchanged if you held your depositary shares as a capital asset at the time of the exchange for shares of preferred stock the holding period for your shares of preferred stock will include the period during which you owned the depositary shares

forwardlooking statements and risk factors 

 

this section discusses the most significant factors that affect our business operations and financial condition it does not describe all risks and uncertainties applicable to us our industry or ownership of our securities if any of the following risks as well as other risks and uncertainties that are not yet identified or that we currently think are not material actually occur we could be materially adversely affected in that event the value of our securities could decline 

 

this annual report on form 10k and the documents incorporated by reference contain statements that constitute “forwardlooking statements” as that term is defined in the federal securities laws these forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to those regarding 

 

  

when we use words such as “may” “will” “intend” “should” “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “project” “estimate” or similar expressions we are making forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties our expected results may not be achieved and 

actual results may differ materially from our expectations this may be a result of various factors including but not limited to 

 

  

risk factors related to our operators’ revenues and expenses 

 

our investment property operators’ revenues are primarily driven by occupancy medicare and medicaid reimbursement if applicable and private pay rates expenses for these facilities are primarily driven by the costs of labor food utilities taxes insurance and rent or debt service revenues from government reimbursement have and may continue to come under pressure due to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls liability insurance and staffing costs continue to increase for our operators to the extent that any decrease in revenues andor any increase in operating expenses result in a property not generating enough cash to make payments to us the credit of our operator and the value of other collateral would have to be relied upon 

 

the recent and ongoing credit and liquidity crisis and the weakening economy may have an adverse effect on our operators and tenants including their ability to access credit or maintain occupancy rates if the operations cash flows or financial condition of our operators are materially adversely impacted by the current economic conditions our revenue and operations may be adversely affected 

increased competition may affect our operators’ ability to meet their obligations to us 

 

the operators of our properties compete on a local and regional basis with operators of properties and other health care providers that provide comparable services we cannot be certain that the operators of all of our facilities will be able to achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us our operators are expected to encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to attract residents or expand their businesses 

 

risk factors related to obligor bankruptcies 

 

we are exposed to the risk that our obligors may not be able to meet the rent principal and interest or other payments due us which may result in an obligor bankruptcy or insolvency or that an obligor might become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings for other reasons although our operating lease agreements provide us with the right to evict a tenant demand immediate payment of rent and exercise other remedies and our loans provide us with the right to terminate any funding obligation demand immediate repayment of principal and unpaid interest foreclose on the collateral and exercise other remedies the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization an obligor in bankruptcy or subject to insolvency proceedings may be able to limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent in the case of a lease or to receive unpaid principal and interest in the case of a loan and to exercise other rights and remedies 

 

we may be required to fund certain expenses eg real estate taxes and maintenance to preserve the value of an investment property avoid the imposition of liens on a property andor transition a property to a new tenant in some instances we have terminated our lease with a tenant and relet the property to another tenant in some of those situations we have provided working capital loans to and limited indemnification of the new obligor if we cannot transition a leased property to a new tenant we may take possession of that property which may expose us to certain successor liabilities should such events occur our revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely affected 

 

transfers of health care facilities may require regulatory approvals and these facilities may not have efficient alternative uses 

 

transfers of health care facilities to successor operators frequently are subject to regulatory approvals including change of ownership approvals under certificate of need “con” laws state licensure laws and medicare and medicaid provider arrangements that are not required for transfers of other types of real estate the replacement of an operator could be delayed by the approval process of any federal state or local agency necessary for the transfer of the facility or the replacement of the operator licensed to manage the facility alternatively given the specialized nature of our facilities we may be required to spend substantial time and funds to adapt these properties to other uses if we are unable to timely transfer properties to successor operators or find efficient alternative uses our revenue and operations may be adversely affected 

 

risk factors related to government regulations 

 

our obligors’ businesses are affected by government reimbursement and private payor rates to the extent that an operatortenant receives a significant portion of its revenues from governmental payors primarily medicare and medicaid such revenues may be subject to statutory and regulatory changes retroactive rate adjustments recovery of program overpayments or setoffs administrative rulings policy interpretations payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers government funding restrictions at a program level or with respect to specific facilities and interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing governmental investigations and audits at such property in recent years governmental payors have frozen or reduced payments to health care providers due to budgetary pressures health care reimbursement will likely continue to be of paramount importance to federal and state authorities we cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or effect any future legislative reforms may have on the financial condition of our obligors and properties there can be no assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will be available for services provided by any property operator whether the property receives reimbursement from medicare medicaid or private payors significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on an obligor’s liquidity financial 

condition and results of operations which could adversely affect the ability of an obligor to meet its obligations to us see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — reimbursement” above 

 

our operators and tenants generally are subject to extensive federal state and local licensure certification and inspection laws and regulations our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with any of these laws could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension or decertification from federal and state health care programs loss of license or closure of the facility such actions may have an effect on our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make lease payments to us and therefore adversely impact us see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — other related laws” above 

 

many of our properties may require a license andor con to operate failure to obtain a license or con or loss of a required license or con would prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by the operators or tenants these events could materially adversely affect our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make rent payments to us state and local laws also may regulate expansion including the addition of new beds or services or acquisition of medical equipment and the construction of health care facilities by requiring a con or other similar approval see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — licensing and certification” above 

 

the american reinvestment and recovery act of 2009 which was signed into law on february 17 2009 provides 87 billion in additional federal medicaid funding for states’ medicaid expenditures between october 1 2008 and december 31 2010 under this act states meeting certain eligibility requirements will temporarily receive additional money in the form of an increase in the federal medical assistance percentage fmap thus for a limited period of time the share of medicaid costs that are paid for by the federal government will go up and each state’s share will go down we cannot predict whether states are or will remain eligible to receive the additional federal medicaid funding or whether the states will have sufficient funds for their medicaid programs we also cannot predict the impact that this broadbased farreaching legislation will have on the us economy or our business 

 

risk factors related to liability claims and insurance costs 

 

longterm care property operators skilled nursing facilities assisted living facilities and independent livingcontinuing care retirement communities have experienced substantial increases in both the number and size of patient care liability claims in recent years as a result general and professional liability costs have increased in some markets no assurances can be given that the climate for longterm care general and professional liability insurance will improve in any states where the property operators conduct business insurance companies may reduce or stop writing general and professional liability policies for longterm care facilities thus general and professional liability insurance coverage may be restricted or very costly which may adversely affect the property operators’ future operations cash flows and financial condition and may have a material adverse effect on the property operators’ ability to meet their obligations to us 

 

risk factors related to acquisitions 

 

we are exposed to the risk that some of our acquisitions may not prove to be successful we could encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired properties including contingent liabilities and acquired properties might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business if we agree to provide construction funding to an operatortenant and the project is not completed we may need to take steps to ensure completion of the project moreover if we issue equity securities or incur additional debt or both to finance future acquisitions it may reduce our per share financial results these costs may negatively affect our results of operations 

 

risk factors related to indebtedness 

 

permanent financing for our investments is typically provided through a combination of public and private offerings of debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt the incurrence or assumption of indebtedness may cause us to become more leveraged which could 1 require us to dedicate a greater portion of our cash flow to the payment of debt service 2 make us more vulnerable to a downturn in the economy 3 limit our ability to obtain additional financing or 4 negatively affect our credit ratings or outlook by one or more of the noted rating agencies 

our debt agreements contain various covenants restrictions and events of default among other things these provisions require us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness create liens and make investments or acquisitions breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness in addition to any other indebtedness crossdefaulted against such instruments these defaults could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

risk factors related to our credit ratings 

 

as of february 16 2009 our senior unsecured notes were rated baa2 stable bbb stable and bbb stable by moody’s investors service standard  poor’s ratings services and fitch ratings respectively we plan to manage the company to maintain investment grade status with a capital structure consistent with our current profile but there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the noted rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity andor financial condition 

 

risk factors related to interest rate swaps 

 

we enter into interest rate swap agreements from time to time to manage some of our exposure to interest rate volatility these swap agreements involve risks such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements in addition these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates when we use forwardstarting interest rate swaps there is a risk that we will not complete the longterm borrowing against which the swap is intended to hedge if such events occur our results of operations may be adversely affected 

 

risk factors related to environmental laws 

 

under various federal and state laws owners or operators of real estate may be required to respond to the presence or release of hazardous substances on the property and may be held liable for property damage personal injuries or penalties that result from environmental contamination or exposure to hazardous substances we may become liable to reimburse the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination generally such liability attaches to a person based on the person’s relationship to the property our tenants or borrowers are primarily responsible for the condition of the property moreover we review environmental site assessments of the properties that we own or encumber prior to taking an interest in them those assessments are designed to meet the “all appropriate inquiry” standard which we believe qualifies us for the innocent purchaser defense if environmental liabilities arise based upon such assessments we do not believe that any of our properties are subject to material environmental contamination however environmental liabilities may be present in our properties and we may incur costs to remediate contamination which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition or the business or financial condition of our obligors 

 

risk factors related to facilities that require entrance fees 

 

certain of our senior housing facilities require the payment of an upfront entrance fee by the resident a portion of which may be refundable by the operator some of these facilities are subject to substantial oversight by state regulators relating to these funds as a result of this oversight residents of these facilities may have a variety of rights including for example the right to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time and certain lien rights the oversight and rights of residents within these facilities may have an effect on the revenue or operations of the operators of such facilities and therefore may negatively impact us 

 

risk factors related to facilities under construction or development 

 

at any given time we may be in the process of constructing one or more new facilities that ultimately will require a con and license before they can be utilized by the operator for their intended use the operator also may need to obtain medicare and medicaid certification and enter into medicare and medicaid provider agreements 

andor third party payor contracts in the event that the operator is unable to obtain the necessary con licensure certification provider agreements or contracts after the completion of construction there is a risk that we will not be able to earn any revenues on the facility until either the initial operator obtains a license or certification to operate the new facility and the necessary provider agreements or contracts or we can find and contract with a new operator that is able to obtain a license to operate the facility for its intended use and the necessary provider agreements or contracts 

 

in connection with our renovation redevelopment development and related construction activities we may be unable to obtain or suffer delays in obtaining necessary zoning landuse building occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations these factors could result in increased costs or our abandonment of these projects in addition we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms which may render us unable to proceed with our development activities and we may not be able to complete construction and leaseup of a property on schedule which could result in increased debt service expense or construction costs 

 

additionally the time frame required for development construction and leaseup of these properties means that we may have to wait years for significant cash returns because we are required to make cash distributions to our stockholders if the cash flow from operations or refinancing is not sufficient we may be forced to borrow additional money to fund such distributions newly developed and acquired properties may not produce the cash flow that we expect which could adversely affect our overall financial performance 

 

in deciding whether to acquire or develop a particular property we make assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property in particular we estimate the return on our investment based on expected occupancy and rental rates if our financial projections with respect to a new property are inaccurate and the property is unable to achieve the expected occupancy and rental rates it may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment our estimate of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove to be inaccurate which may result in our failure to meet our profitability goals additionally we may acquire new properties that are not fully leased and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with that property 

 

we do not know if our tenants will renew their existing leases and if they do not we may be unable to lease the properties on as favorable terms or at all 

 

we cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases at the end of their lease terms which expire at various times through 2045 if these leases are not renewed we would be required to find other tenants to occupy those properties or sell them there can be no assurance that we would be able to identify suitable replacement tenants or enter into leases with new tenants on terms as favorable to us as the current leases or that we would be able to lease those properties at all 

 

our ownership of properties through ground leases exposes us to the loss of such properties upon breach or termination of the ground leases 

 

we have acquired an interest in certain of our properties by acquiring a leasehold interest in the property on which the building is located and we may acquire additional properties in the future through the purchase of interests in ground leases as the lessee under a ground lease we are exposed to the possibility of losing the property upon termination of the ground lease or an earlier breach of the ground lease by us 

 

illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties 

 

real estate investments are relatively illiquid our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in economic and other conditions will be limited no assurances can be given that we will recognize full value for any property that we are required to sell for liquidity reasons our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition we are exposed to the risks inherent in concentrating investments in real estate and in particular the seniors housing and healthcare industries a downturn in the real estate industry could adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to sell properties for a price or on terms acceptable to us 

risk factors related to reinvestment of sale proceeds 

 

from time to time we will have cash available from 1 the proceeds of sales of our securities 2 principal payments on our loans receivable and 3 the sale of properties including nonelective dispositions under the terms of master leases or similar financial support arrangements in order to maintain current revenues and continue generating attractive returns we expect to reinvest these proceeds in a timely manner we compete for real estate investments with a broad variety of potential investors this competition for attractive investments may negatively affect our ability to make timely investments on terms acceptable to us 

 

failure to properly manage our rapid growth could distract our management or increase our expenses 

 

we have experienced rapid growth and development in a relatively short period of time and expect to continue this rapid growth in the future our rapid growth has resulted in increased levels of responsibility for our management future property acquisitions could place significant additional demands on and require us to expand our management resources and personnel our failure to manage any such rapid growth effectively could harm our business and in particular our financial condition results of operations and cash flows which could negatively affect our ability to make distributions to stockholders our rapid growth could also increase our capital requirements which may require us to issue potentially dilutive equity securities and incur additional debt 

 

we might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

 

we intend to operate as a reit under the internal revenue code and believe we have and will continue to operate in such a manner if we lose our status as a reit we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for satisfying our obligations and for distribution to our stockholders for each of the years involved because 

 

  

since reit qualification requires us to meet a number of complex requirements it is possible that we may fail to fulfill them and if we do our earnings will be reduced by the amount of federal taxes owed a reduction in our earnings would affect the amount we could distribute to our stockholders also if we were not a reit we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders since a nonreit is not required in order to avoid an excise tax to pay dividends to stockholders amounting to at least the sum of 1 85 of our reit ordinary income for the year 2 95 of our reit capital gain income for such year other than capital gain that we elect to retain and pay tax on and 3 any undistributed taxable income from preceding periods see “item 1 — business — federal income tax considerations” for a discussion of the provisions of the internal revenue code that apply to us and the effects of nonqualification 

 

in addition if we fail to qualify as a reit all distributions to stockholders would continue to be treated as dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earning and profits although corporate stockholders may be eligible for the dividends received deduction and individual stockholders may be eligible for taxation at the rates generally applicable to longterm capital gains currently at a maximum rate of 15 with respect to distributions 

 

as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to implement our business strategy and would adversely affect the value of our common stock 

 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to remain qualified as a reit although we believe that we qualify as a reit we cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify or remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations” included in this annual report on form 10k 

the 90 annual distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions 

 

to comply with the 90 distribution requirement applicable to reits and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax we must make distributions to our stockholders see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations — qualification as a reit — annual distribution requirements” included in this annual report on form 10k although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the reit distribution requirement it is possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90 distribution requirement or we may decide to retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation this may be due to timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses on the one hand and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income on the other hand in addition nondeductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of noncash deductions may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90 distribution requirement in the event that timing differences occur or we deem it appropriate to retain cash we may borrow funds issue additional equity securities although we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so pay taxable stock dividends if possible distribute other property or securities or engage in a transaction intended to enable us to meet the reit distribution requirements this may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations 

 

the amount of additional indebtedness we may incur is limited by the terms of our line of credit arrangement and the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes in addition adverse economic conditions may impact the availability of additional funds or could cause the terms on which we are able to borrow additional funds to become unfavorable in those circumstances we may be required to raise additional equity in the capital markets our access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control including rising interest rates inflation and other general market conditions and the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of the shares of our capital stock we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the capital necessary to make future investments or to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature 

 

other risk factors 

 

we are also subject to other risks first our second restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain antitakeover provisions staggered board provisions restrictions on share ownership and transfer and super majority stockholder approval requirements for business combinations that could make it more difficult for or even prevent a third party from acquiring us without the approval of our incumbent board of directors provisions and agreements that inhibit or discourage takeover attempts could reduce the market value of our common stock 

 

additionally we are dependent on key personnel although we have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers losing any one of them could at least temporarily have an adverse impact on our operations we believe that losing more than one could have a material adverse impact on our business

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

the following discussion and analysis is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of health care reit inc for the periods presented and should be read together with the notes thereto contained in this annual report on form 10k other important factors are identified in “item 1 — business” and “item 1a — risk factors” above 

 

executive overview 

 

company overview 

 

health care reit inc an sp 500 company is a real estate investment trust that invests in senior housing and health care real estate founded in 1970 we were the first reit to invest exclusively in health care properties the following table summarizes our portfolio as of december 31 2008 

 

 

 

 

  

health care industry 

 

the demand for health care services and consequently health care properties is projected to reach unprecedented levels in the near future the centers for medicare and medicaid services projects that national health expenditures will rise to 38 trillion in 2015 or 188 of gross domestic product “gdp” this is up from 2 trillion or 159 of gdp in 2005 health expenditures per capita are projected to rise 58 per year from 2005 to 2015 while demographics are the primary driver of demand economic conditions and availability of services contribute to health care service utilization rates we believe the health care property market is less susceptible to fluctuations and economic downturns relative to other property sectors investor interest in the market remains strong especially in specific sectors such as medical office regardless of the current stringent lending environment as a reit we believe we are positioned to benefit from any turbulence in the capital markets due to our access to capital 

 

the total us population is projected to increase by 22 through 2030 the elderly are an important component of health care utilization especially independent living services assisted living services skilled nursing services inpatient and outpatient hospital services and physician ambulatory care the elderly population aged 65 and over is projected to increase by 83 through 2030 most health care services are provided within a health care facility such as a hospital a physician’s office or a senior housing facility therefore we believe there will be continued demand for companies such as ours with expertise in health care real estate 

the following chart illustrates the projected increase in the elderly population aged 65 and over 

 

 

source us census bureau 

 

health care real estate investment opportunities tend to increase as demand for health care services increases we recognize the need for health care real estate as it correlates to health care service demand health care providers require real estate to house their businesses and expand their services we believe that investment opportunities in health care real estate will continue to be present due to the 

 

  

economic outlook 

 

beginning in late 2007 and throughout 2008 the us and global economy entered a serious recession the current economic environment is characterized by a severe residential housing slump depressed commercial real estate valuations weakened consumer confidence rising unemployment and concerns regarding inflation deflation and stagflation numerous financial systems around the globe have become illiquid and banks have become less willing to lend to other banks and borrowers further capital markets have become and remain volatile as risk is repriced and investments are revalued uncertainty remains in terms of the depth and duration of these adverse economic conditions 

 

the conditions described above have created an environment of limited capital availability and increasing capital costs this was most evident in the credit markets where lending institutions cut back on loans tightened credit standards and significantly increased interest rate spreads the equity markets were characterized by sporadic accessibility until late 2008 when share prices in most sectors declined significantly continued volatility in the capital markets could limit our ability to access debt or equity funds which in turn could impact our ability to finance future investments and react to changing economic and business conditions this difficult operating environment also may make it more difficult for some of our operatorstenants to meet their obligations to us 

 

during 2008 our focus gradually shifted from investment to capital preservation to that end our efforts in 2009 will be directed towards liquidity portfolio management and investment rationalization

our primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and enhance stockholder value we seek to pay consistent cash dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual increases in rental and interest income and portfolio growth to meet these objectives we invest across the full spectrum of senior housing and health care real estate and diversify our investment portfolio by property type operatortenant and geographic location 

 

substantially all of our revenues and sources of cash flows from operations are derived from operating lease rentals and interest earned on outstanding loans receivable these items represent our primary source of liquidity to fund distributions and are dependent upon our obligors’ continued ability to make contractual rent and interest payments to us to the extent that our obligors experience operating difficulties and are unable to generate sufficient cash to make payments to us there could be a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity andor financial condition to mitigate this risk we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property and operatortenant our asset management process includes review of monthly financial statements for each property periodic review of obligor credit periodic property inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure real estate taxes letters of credit and other collateral in monitoring our portfolio our personnel use a proprietary database to collect and analyze propertyspecific data additionally we conduct extensive research to ascertain industry trends and risks through these asset management and research efforts we are typically able to intervene at an early stage to address payment risk and in so doing support both the collectability of revenue and the value of our investment 

 

in addition to our asset management and research efforts we also structure our investments to help mitigate payment risk operating leases and loans are normally credit enhanced by guaranties andor letters of credit in addition operating leases are typically structured as master leases and loans are generally crossdefaulted and crosscollateralized with other loans operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its affiliates 

 

for the year ended december 31 2008 rental income and interest income represented 91 and 7 respectively of total gross revenues including discontinued operations substantially all of our operating leases are designed with either fixed or contingent escalating rent structures leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straightline basis over the initial lease period subject to a collectability assessment rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period our yield on loans receivable depends upon a number of factors including the stated interest rate the average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments 

 

depending upon the availability and cost of external capital we believe our liquidity is sufficient to fund operations meet debt service obligations both principal and interest make dividend distributions and complete construction projects in process we also anticipate evaluating opportunities to finance future investments new investments are generally funded from temporary borrowings under our unsecured line of credit arrangement internally generated cash and the proceeds from sales of real property our investments generate internal cash from rent and interest receipts and principal payments on loans receivable permanent financing for future investments which replaces funds drawn under the unsecured line of credit arrangement has historically been provided through a combination of public and private offerings of debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt 

depending upon market conditions we believe that new investments will be available in the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to our stockholders we expect to complete gross new investments of 600000000 in 2009 comprised of funded new development we anticipate the sale of real property and the repayment of loans receivable totaling approximately 200000000 to 300000000 during 2009 it is possible that additional loan repayments or sales of real property may occur in the future to the extent that loan repayments and real property sales exceed new investments our revenues and cash flows from operations could be adversely affected we expect to reinvest the proceeds from any loan repayments and real property sales in new investments to the extent that new investment requirements exceed our available cash onhand we expect to borrow under our unsecured line of credit arrangement at december 31 2008 we had 23370000 of cash and cash equivalents 154070000 of restricted cash and 580000000 of available borrowing capacity under our unsecured line of credit arrangement our investment activity may exceed our borrowing capacity under our unsecured line of credit to the extent that we are unable to issue equity or debt securities to provide additional capital we may not be able to fund all of our potential investments which could have an adverse effect on our revenues and cash flows from operations

key performance indicators trends and uncertainties 

 

we utilize several key performance indicators to evaluate the various aspects of our business these indicators are discussed below and relate to operating performance credit strength and concentration risk management uses these key performance indicators to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results and in making operating decisions 

 

operating performance we believe that net income available to common stockholders “nics” is the most appropriate earnings measure other useful supplemental measures of our operating performance include funds from operations “ffo” and net operating income “noi” however these supplemental measures are not defined by us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” please refer to the section entitled “nongaap financial measures” for further discussion of ffo and noi and for reconciliations of ffo and noi these earning measures and their relative per share amounts are widely used by investors and analysts in the valuation comparison and investment recommendations of reits the following table reflects the recent historical trends of our operating performance measures in thousands except per share data 

 

 

 

credit strength we measure our credit strength both in terms of leverage ratios and coverage ratios our leverage ratios include debt to book capitalization debt to undepreciated book capitalization and debt to market capitalization the leverage ratios indicate how much of our balance sheet capitalization is related to total debt our coverage ratios include interest coverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio the coverage ratios indicate our ability to service interest and fixed charges interest plus preferred dividends and secured debt principal amortizations we expect to maintain capitalization ratios and coverage ratios sufficient to maintain investment grade ratings with moody’s investors service standard  poor’s ratings services and fitch ratings the coverage ratios are based on adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “adjusted ebitda” which is discussed in further detail and reconciled to net income below in “nongaap financial measures” leverage ratios and coverage ratios are widely used by investors analysts and rating agencies in the valuation comparison investment recommendations and rating of companies the following table reflects the recent historical trends for our credit strength measures 

 

 

 

concentration risk we evaluate our concentration risk in terms of asset mix investment mix customer mix and geographic mix concentration risk is a valuable measure in understanding what portion of our investments could be at risk if certain sectors were to experience downturns asset mix measures the portion of our investments that are real property in order to qualify as an equity reit at least 75 of our real estate investments must be real 

property whereby each property which includes the land buildings improvements intangibles and related rights is owned by us and leased to an operator pursuant to a longterm operating lease investment mix measures the portion of our investments that relate to our various property types customer mix measures the portion of our investments that relate to our top five customers geographic mix measures the portion of our investments that relate to our top five states the following table reflects our recent historical trends of concentration risk 

 

 

 

we evaluate our key performance indicators in conjunction with current expectations to determine if historical trends are indicative of future results our expected results may not be achieved and actual results may differ materially from our expectations management regularly monitors various economic and other factors to develop strategic and tactical plans designed to improve performance and maximize our competitive position our ability to achieve our financial objectives is dependent upon our ability to effectively execute these plans and to appropriately respond to emerging economic and companyspecific trends please refer to “item 1a — risk factors” above for further discussion

we capitalize certain interest costs associated with funds used to finance the construction of properties owned directly by us the amount capitalized is based upon the borrowings outstanding during the construction period using the rate of interest that approximates our cost of financing our interest expense is reduced by the amount capitalized capitalized interest for the years ended december 31 2006 2007 and 2008 totaled 4470000 12526000 and 25029000 respectively 

 

on may 6 2004 we entered into two interest rate swap agreements the “2004 swaps” for a total notional amount of 100000000 to hedge changes in fair value attributable to changes in the libor swap rate of 100000000 of fixed rate debt with a maturity date of november 15 2013 the 2004 swaps were treated as fairvalue hedges for accounting purposes and we utilized the shortcut method to assess effectiveness the 2004 swaps were with highly rated counterparties in which we received a fixed rate of 60 and paid a variable rate based on sixmonth libor plus a spread for the year ended december 31 2006 we incurred 197000 of losses related to the 2004 swaps that was recorded as an addition to interest expense for the year ended december 31 2007 we generated 89000 of savings related to the 2004 swaps that was recorded as a reduction of interest expense on september 12 2007 we terminated the 2004 swaps and we received a 2125000 cash settlement the unamortized amount of this settlement at december 31 2008 was 1634000 1973000 at december 31 2007 and is recorded as an adjustment to the hedged item this amount will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the hedged debt using the effective interest method for the year ended december 31 2008 339000 of amortization was recognized as a reduction to senior unsecured notes interest expense 

 

on july 2 2007 we entered into two forwardstarting interest rate swaps the “july 2007 swaps” with an aggregate notional amount of 200000000 that were designated as cash flow hedges of the variability in forecasted interest payments attributable to changes in the libor swap rate on longterm fixed rate debt forecasted to be issued in 2007 the july 2007 swaps had the economic effect of fixing 200000000 of our debt at 4913 for five years the july 2007 swaps were settled on july 17 2007 which was the date that the forecasted debt was priced the cash settlement value of these contracts at july 17 2007 was 733000 this amount represented the effective portion of the hedges as there was no hedge ineffectiveness therefore the 733000 settlement value was deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” and will be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method the unamortized amount of aoci related to these contracts at december 31 2008 is 521000 

668000 at december 31 2007 for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 we reclassified 147000 and 65000 respectively out of aoci as a reduction of interest expense 

 

on september 12 2007 we entered into two forwardstarting interest rate swaps the “september 2007 swaps” for a total notional amount of 250000000 to hedge 10 years of interest payments associated with a longterm borrowing that was expected to occur in 2008 the september 2007 swaps each had an effective date of september 12 2008 and a maturity date of september 12 2018 we expected to settle the 2007 swaps when the debt was to be priced the september 2007 swaps were to have the economic effect of fixing 250000000 of our future debt at 4469 plus a credit spread for 10 years the september 2007 swaps had been designated as cash flow hedges and we expected the 2007 swaps to be highly effective at offsetting changes in cash flows of interest payments on 250000000 of our future debt due to changes in the libor swap rate therefore effective changes in the fair value of the september 2007 swaps were recorded in aoci and were to be reclassified to interest expense when the hedged forecasted transactions affected earnings as interest payments are made on the expected debt issuance the ineffective portion of the changes in fair value was to be recorded directly in earnings 

 

at december 31 2007 the september 2007 swaps were reported at their fair value of 7990000 and were included in other liabilities and aoci during the year ended december 31 2008 as a result of the severe dislocation in the credit markets we terminated plans to issue debt and also terminated the september 2007 swaps for 23393000 amounts previously recorded in aoci were reclassified to realized loss on derivatives resulting in 23393000 of expense as the forecasted transaction was no longer probable to occur 

 

loan expense represents the amortization of deferred loan costs incurred in connection with the issuance and amendments of debt the change in loan expense is primarily due to costs associated with the issuance of 345000000 of senior unsecured convertible notes in november and december 2006 the issuance of 400000000 of senior unsecured convertible notes in july 2007 and costs associated with the extension and expansion of our unsecured line of credit in august 2007 

 

general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues including revenues from discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2008 were 824 as compared with 764 and 826 for the same periods in 2007 and 2006 the increase from 2006 to 2007 is primarily related to the windrose merger completed on december 20 2006 the paramount acquisition completed in may 2007 1750000 of acquisition finders’ fees paid during the three months ended june 30 2007 and costs associated with our initiatives to attract and retain appropriate personnel to achieve our business objectives during the quarter ended june 30 2007 we recorded 1750000 of onetime acquisition finders’ fees paid to former windrose management in connection with the closing of the rendinaparamount transaction these fees relate to services rendered prior to the consummation of the windrose merger in december 2006 due to the recipients’ current employment status with the company the fees have been expensed as compensation rather than included in the purchase price of the acquisition as is typical with such fees the increase from 2007 to 2008 is primarily due to 2291000 of nonrecurring terminated transaction costs and costs associated with our initiatives to attract and retain appropriate personnel to achieve our business objectives the terminated transaction costs primarily related to the termination of the arcapitasunrise agreement 

 

the change in preferred dividends is primarily due to the change in average outstanding preferred shares the following is a summary of our preferred stock activity 

 

 

 

in conjunction with the acquisition of windrose medical properties trust in december 2006 we issued 2100000 shares of 75 series g cumulative convertible preferred stock these shares have a liquidation value 

of 2500 per share dividends are payable quarterly in arrears the preferred stock which has no stated maturity may be redeemed by us at a redemption price of 2500 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends on such shares to the redemption date on or after june 30 2010 each series g preferred share is convertible by the holder into our common stock at a conversion price of 3493 equivalent to a conversion rate of 07157 common shares per series g preferred share these shares were recorded at 2958 per share which was deemed to be the fair value at the date of issuance 

 

nongaap financial measures 

 

we believe that net income as defined by us gaap is the most appropriate earnings measurement however we consider ffo to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with us gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation however since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient in response the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” created ffo as a supplemental measure of operating performance for reits that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income ffo as defined by nareit means net income computed in accordance with us gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 

 

net operating income “noi” is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties we define noi as total revenues including tenant reimbursements less property operating expenses which exclude depreciation and amortization general and administrative expenses impairments and interest expense we believe noi provides investors relevant and useful information because it measures the operating performance of our properties at the property level on an unleveraged basis we use noi to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess the property level performance of our properties 

 

ebitda stands for earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization a covenant in our line of credit arrangement contains a financial ratio based on a definition of ebitda that is specific to that agreement failure to satisfy this covenant could result in an event of default that could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity andor financial condition due to the materiality of this debt agreement and the financial covenant we have disclosed adjusted ebitda which represents ebitda as defined above and adjusted for stockbased compensation expense provision for loan losses and gainloss on extinguishment of debt we use adjusted ebitda to measure our adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio which represents adjusted ebitda divided by fixed charges on a trailing twelve months basis fixed charges include total interest excluding capitalized interest secured debt principal amortization and preferred dividends our covenant requires an adjusted fixed charge ratio of at least 175 times 

 

other than adjusted ebitda our supplemental reporting measures and similarly entitled financial measures are widely used by investors equity and debt analysts and rating agencies in the valuation comparison rating and investment recommendations of companies management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results and in making operating decisions additionally these measures are utilized by the board of directors to evaluate management adjusted ebitda is used solely to determine our compliance with a financial covenant of our line of credit arrangement and is not being presented for use by investors for any other purpose none of our supplemental measures represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with us gaap and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity finally the supplemental reporting measures as defined by us may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies multiperiod amounts may not equal the sum of the individual quarterly amounts due to rounding

critical accounting policies 

 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap which requires us to make estimates and assumptions management considers an accounting estimate or assumption critical if 

 

  

management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate and are not reasonably likely to change in the future however since these estimates require assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made they bear the risk of change if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations liquidity andor financial condition please refer to note 1 of our audited consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact us there were no material changes to these policies in 2008 

the following table presents information about our critical accounting policies as well as the material assumptions used to develop each estimate

impact of inflation 

 

during the past three years inflation has not significantly affected our earnings because of the moderate inflation rate additionally our earnings are primarily longterm investments with fixed rates of return these investments are mainly financed with a combination of equity senior unsecured notes and borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements during inflationary periods which generally are accompanied by rising interest rates our ability to grow may be adversely affected because the yield on new investments may increase at a slower rate than new borrowing costs presuming the current inflation rate remains moderate and longterm interest rates do not increase significantly we believe that inflation will not impact the availability of equity and debt financing for us

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

we are exposed to various market risks including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates we seek to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates by matching the terms of new investments with new longterm fixed rate borrowings to the extent possible we may or may not elect to use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate exposure these decisions are principally based on our policy to match our variable rate investments with comparable borrowings but are also based on the general trend in interest rates at the applicable dates and our perception of the future volatility of interest rates this section is presented to provide a discussion of the risks associated with potential fluctuations in interest rates 

 

we historically borrow on our unsecured lines of credit arrangements to acquire construct or make loans relating to health care and senior housing properties then as market conditions dictate we will issue equity or longterm fixed rate debt to repay the borrowings under the unsecured lines of credit arrangements 

a change in interest rates will not affect the interest expense associated with our fixed rate debt interest rate changes however will affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt changes in the interest rate environment upon maturity of this fixed rate debt could have an effect on our future cash flows and earnings depending on whether the debt is replaced with other fixed rate debt variable rate debt or equity or repaid by the sale of assets to illustrate the impact of changes in the interest rate markets we performed a sensitivity analysis on our fixed rate debt instruments whereby we modeled the change in net present values arising from a hypothetical 1 increase in interest rates to determine the instruments’ change in fair value the following table summarizes the analysis performed as of the dates indicated in thousands 

 

 

 

on september 12 2007 we entered into two forwardstarting interest rate swaps the “september 2007 swaps” for a total notional amount of 250000000 to hedge 10 years of interest payments associated with a longterm borrowing that was expected to occur in 2008 the september 2007 swaps each had an effective date of september 12 2008 and a maturity date of september 12 2018 we expected to settle the 2007 swaps when the debt was to be priced the september 2007 swaps were to have the economic effect of fixing 250000000 of our future debt at 4469 plus a credit spread for 10 years the september 2007 swaps had been designated as cash flow hedges and we expected the 2007 swaps to be highly effective at offsetting changes in cash flows of interest payments on 250000000 of our future debt due to changes in the libor swap rate therefore effective changes in the fair value of the september 2007 swaps were recorded in aoci and were to be reclassified to interest expense when the hedged forecasted transactions affected earnings as interest payments are made on the expected debt issuance the ineffective portion of the changes in fair value was to be recorded directly in earnings at december 31 2007 the september 2007 swaps were reported at their fair value of 7990000 and were included in other liabilities and aoci during the year ended december 31 2008 as a result of the severe dislocation in the credit markets we terminated plans to issue debt and also terminated the september 2007 swaps for 23393000 amounts previously recorded in aoci were reclassified to realized loss on derivatives resulting in 23393000 of expense as the forecasted transaction was no longer probable to occur 

 

our variable rate debt including our unsecured line of credit arrangement is reflected at fair value at december 31 2008 we had 570000000 outstanding related to our variable rate debt and assuming no changes in outstanding balances a 1 increase in interest rates would result in increased annual interest expense of 5700000 at december 31 2007 we had 321232000 outstanding related to our variable rate debt and assuming no changes in outstanding balances a 1 increase in interest rates would have resulted in increased annual interest expense of 3212000 

 

we are subject to risks associated with debt financing including the risk that existing indebtedness may not be refinanced or that the terms of refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of current indebtedness the majority of our borrowings were completed under indentures or contractual agreements that limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur accordingly in the event that we are unable to raise additional equity or borrow money because of these limitations our ability to acquire additional properties may be limited

property types 

 

our primary property types include investment properties and operating properties investment properties are those in which we do not participate in the management of the property and include skilled nursing facilities assisted living facilities independent livingcontinuing care retirement communities and certain specialty care facilities our operating properties are those in which we are responsible for the management of the property and are primarily medical office buildings our properties include standalone facilities that provide one level of service combination facilities that provide multiple levels of service and communities or campuses that provide a wide range of services the following is a summary of our various property types 

 

assisted living facilities 

 

assisted living facilities are state regulated rental properties that provide the same services as independent living facilities but also provide supportive care from trained employees to residents who require assistance with activities of daily living including management of medications bathing dressing toileting ambulating and eating 

 

alzheimer’sdementia care facilities certain assisted living facilities may include state licensed settings that specialize in caring for those afflicted with alzheimer’s disease andor similar forms of dementia 

 

skilled nursing facilities 

 

skilled nursing facilities are licensed daily rate or rental properties where the majority of individuals require 24hour nursing andor medical care generally these properties are licensed for medicaid andor medicare reimbursement 

 

independent livingcontinuing care retirement communities 

 

these communities may include one or more of the following property types 

 

continuing care retirement communities continuing care retirement communities include a combination of detached homes an independent living facility an assisted living facility andor a skilled nursing facility on one campus these communities are appealing to residents because there is no need for relocating when health and medical needs change resident payment plans vary but can include entrance fees condominium fees and rental fees many of these communities also charge monthly maintenance fees in exchange for a living unit meals and some health services 

active adult communities active adult communities contain primarily forsale singlefamily homes townhomes cluster homes mobile homes andor condominiums with no specialized services these communities are typically restricted or targeted to adults at least 55 years of age or older residents generally lead an independent lifestyle communities may include amenities such as a clubhouse golf course and recreational spaces 

 

independent living facilities independent living facilities are agerestricted multifamily properties with central dining facilities that provide residents access to meals and other services such as housekeeping linen service transportation and social and recreational activities

medical office buildings 

 

medical office buildings are office and clinic facilities often located near hospitals or on hospital campuses specifically constructed and designed for the use by physicians and other health care personnel to provide services to their patients they may also include ambulatory surgery centers that are used for general or specialty surgical procedures not requiring an overnight stay in a hospital medical office buildings typically contain sole and group physician practices and may provide laboratory and other patient services 

 

investments 

 

we invest across the full spectrum of senior housing and health care real estate we diversify our investment portfolio by property type operatortenant and geographic location in determining whether to invest in a property we focus on the following 1 the experience of the obligor’s management team 2 the historical and projected financial and operational performance of the property 3 the credit of the obligor 4 the security for the lease or loan and 5 the capital committed to the property by the obligor we conduct market research and analysis for all potential investments in addition we review the value of all properties the interest rates and covenant requirements of any debt to be assumed and the anticipated sources of repayment of any existing debt that is not to be assumed 

 

we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property and obligor our asset management process generally includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each property periodic review of obligor creditworthiness periodic property inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure real estate taxes letters of credit and other collateral in monitoring our portfolio our personnel use a proprietary database to collect and analyze propertyspecific data additionally we conduct extensive research to ascertain industry trends and risks 

 

through asset management and research we evaluate the operating environment in each property’s market to determine whether payment risk is likely to increase when we identify unacceptable levels of payment risk we seek to mitigate eliminate or transfer the risk we categorize the risk as obligor property or market risk for obligor risk we typically find a substitute operatortenant to run the property for property risk we usually work with the operatortenant to institute propertylevel management changes to address the risk finally for market risk we often encourage an obligor to change its capital structure including refinancing the property or raising additional equity through these asset management and research efforts we are generally able to intervene at an early stage to address payment risk and in so doing support both the collectibility of revenue and the value of our investment 

 

depending upon market conditions we believe that new investments will be available in the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to our stockholders 

 

segment reporting 

 

our business consists of two business segments — investment properties and operating properties for additional information regarding business segments see note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements

real property our investment properties are those in which we do not participate in the management of the property and are primarily land building improvements and related rights that are leased to operators under longterm operating leases the net value of our investment properties aggregated approximately 3016993000 at december 31 2007 the leases generally have a fixed contractual term of 12 to 15 years and contain one or more five to 15year renewal options most of our rents are received under triplenet leases requiring the operator to pay rent and all additional charges incurred in the operation of the leased property the tenants are required to repair rebuild and maintain the leased properties substantially all of these operating leases are designed with either fixed or contingent escalating rent structures leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straightline basis over the initial lease period subject to a collectibility assessment rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period 

 

at december 31 2007 87 of our investment properties were subject to master leases a master lease is a lease of multiple properties to one tenant entity under a single lease agreement from time to time we may acquire additional properties that are then leased to the tenant under the master lease the tenant is required to make one monthly payment that represents rent on all the properties that are subject to the master lease typically the master lease tenant can exercise its right to purchase the properties or to renew the master lease only with respect to all leased properties at the same time this bundling feature benefits us because the tenant cannot limit the purchase or renewal to the better performing properties and terminate the leasing arrangement with respect to the poorer performing properties this spreads our risk among the entire group of properties within the master lease the bundling feature may provide a similar advantage if the master lease tenant is in bankruptcy subject to certain restrictions a debtor in bankruptcy has the right to assume or reject each of its leases it is our intent that a tenant in bankruptcy would be required to assume or reject the master lease as a whole rather than deciding on a property by property basis 

 

construction we currently provide for the construction of properties for tenants as part of longterm operating leases we capitalize certain interest costs associated with funds used to pay for the construction of properties owned by us the amount capitalized is based upon the amount advanced during the construction period using the rate of interest that approximates our cost of financing our interest expense is reduced by the amount capitalized we also typically charge a transaction fee at the commencement of construction the construction period commences upon funding and terminates upon the earlier of the completion of the applicable property or the end of a specified period during the construction period we advance funds to the tenants in accordance with agreed upon terms and conditions which require among other things periodic site visits by a company representative during the construction period we generally require an additional credit enhancement in the form of payment and performance bonds andor completion guaranties at december 31 2007 we had outstanding construction investments of 313709000 and were committed to providing additional funds of approximately 800697000 to complete construction 

 

real estate loans our real estate loans are typically structured to provide us with interest income principal amortization and transaction fees and are generally secured by a first second or third mortgage lien leasehold mortgage corporate guaranties andor personal guaranties at december 31 2007 we had outstanding real estate loans of 381394000 the interest yield averaged approximately 924 per annum on our outstanding real estate loan balances our yield on real estate loans depends upon a number of factors including the stated interest rate average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments the real estate loans outstanding at december 31 2007 are generally subject to three to 20year terms with principal amortization schedules andor balloon payments of the outstanding principal balances at the end of the term typically real estate loans are crossdefaulted and crosscollateralized with other real estate loans operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its affiliates 

 

operating properties 

 

our operating properties primarily consist of multitenant medical office buildings leased to health care providers management of these properties is provided by paramount real estate services our property management company leases with our tenants are primarily triple net leases that require the tenants to pay their proportionate share of operating expenses other lease types with our tenants are gross or modified gross leases where all or a portion of our operating expenses are not reimbursed by tenants accordingly we incur certain property operating expenses such as real estate taxes repairs and maintenance utilities and insurance at december 31 2007 78 of our operating property leases were triple net as compared to 8 gross and 14 modified gross leases substantially all of our leases at operating properties include annual base rent escalation 

clauses that are either predetermined fixed increases or are a function of an inflation index and typically have an initial term ranging from one to 20 years with a weighted average remaining term of approximately six years as of december 31 2007 operating property leases are normally credit enhanced by guaranties andor letters of credit the net value of our operating properties aggregated approximately 1307931000 at december 31 2007 

 

development services group 

 

through our subsidiary hcn development services group inc “dsg” we develop quality specialty medical properties formerly known as hospital affiliates development corporation or “hadc” dsg develops and constructs new “buildtosuit” and multitenant facilities for us and in some instances for third parties who are expected to develop longterm relationships with the company dsg provides services such as property development facility and medical equipment planning and implementation services to healthcare services physician groups and third party medical property owners 

 

equity investments 

 

equity investments consist of an investment in a public company that has a readily determinable fair market value we classify this equity investment as availableforsale and accordingly record this investment at its fair market value with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income a separate component of stockholders’ equity this investment represents a minimal ownership interest in the company 

 

borrowing policies 

 

we utilize a combination of debt and equity to fund the purchase of new properties and to provide loan financing our debt and equity levels are determined by management to maintain a conservative credit profile generally we intend to issue unsecured fixed rate public debt with longterm maturities to approximate the maturities on our leases and loans for shortterm purposes we may borrow on our unsecured line of credit arrangement we replace these borrowings with longterm capital such as senior unsecured notes common stock or preferred stock when terms are deemed favorable we may invest in properties subject to existing mortgage indebtedness in addition we may obtain secured financing for unleveraged properties in which we have invested or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis it is our intent to limit secured indebtedness in our agreements with our lenders we are subject to restrictions with respect to secured and unsecured indebtedness 

 

competition 

 

we compete with other real estate investment trusts real estate partnerships private equity and hedge fund investors banks insurance companies financeinvestment companies governmentsponsored agencies taxable and taxexempt bond funds health care operators developers and other investors in the acquisition development leasing and financing of health care and senior housing properties some of our competitors are larger with greater resources and lower costs of capital than us increased competition inhibits our ability to identify and successfully complete investments we compete for investments based on a number of factors including rates financings offered underwriting criteria and reputation our ability to successfully compete is also impacted by economic and population trends availability of acceptable investment opportunities our ability to negotiate beneficial investment terms availability and cost of capital construction and renovation costs and new and existing laws and regulations 

 

the operatorstenants of our properties compete on a local and regional basis with operatorstenants of properties that provide comparable services operatorstenants compete for patients and residents based on a number of factors including quality of care reputation physical appearance of properties services offered family preferences physicians staff and price we also face competition from other health care facilities for tenants such as physicians and other health care providers that provide comparable facilities and services

certain government regulations 

 

health law matters — generally 

 

we invest in assisted living skilled nursing independent livingcontinuing care retirement communities medical office buildings and specialty care facilities which represented approximately 21 32 15 25 and 7 respectively of our investments at december 31 2007 

 

typically operators of assisted living and independent living facilities do not receive significant funding from governmental programs and are regulated by the states not the federal government operators of skilled nursing and specialty care facilities do receive significant funding from governmental programs and are subject to federal and state laws that regulate the type and quality of the medical andor nursing care provided ancillary services eg respiratory occupational physical and infusion therapies qualifications of the administrative personnel and nursing staff the adequacy of the physical plant and equipment distribution of pharmaceuticals reimbursement and rate setting and operating policies in addition as described below a number of our property operators are subject to extensive laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including kickbacks physician selfreferrals and false claims hospitals physician group practice clinics and other health care facilities in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal state and local licensure certification and inspection laws and regulations our tenants’ failure to comply with any of these laws could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension or decertification or exclusion from federal and state health care programs loss of license or closure of the facility 

licensing and certification 

 

the primary regulations that affect assisted living facilities are the states’ licensing laws in granting and renewing these licenses the regulatory authorities consider numerous factors relating to a property’s physical plant and operations including but not limited to admission and discharge standards and staffing and training a decision to grant or renew a license is also affected by a property’s record with respect to patient and consumer rights and medication guidelines and rules certain of the senior housing facilities mortgaged to or owned by us may require the resident to pay an entrance or upfront fee a portion of which may be refundable these entrance fee communities are subject to significant state regulatory oversight including for example oversight of each facility’s financial condition establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial restrictions the right of residents to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time lien rights in favor of residents restrictions on change of ownership and similar matters such oversight and the rights of residents within these entrance fee communities may have an effect on the revenue or operations of the operators of such facilities and therefore may adversely affect us 

 

skilled nursing facilities are subject to a variety of licensure and certificate of need “con” laws and regulations con laws in those states that have them generally require a facility to demonstrate the need for constructing a new facility expanding an existing facility changing the ownership or control of an existing licensed facility or terminating services that have been approved through the con process cons where applicable generally are required before a covered facility can construct a new facility add beds or expand services invest in major capital equipment or add new services or terminate services for which the facility has previously been awarded a con and a license the con laws and regulations may restrict the ability of operators to add new properties or expand an existing facility’s size or services in addition con laws may constrain the ability of an operator to transfer responsibility for operating a particular facility to a new operator if we have to replace a barred property operator our ability to replace the operator may be affected by con rules and policies governing changes in control 

 

with respect to licensure generally our skilled nursing and specialty care facilities are required to be licensed and certified for participation in the medicare and medicaid programs this generally requires license renewals and compliance surveys on an annual or biannual basis the failure of our operators to maintain or renew any required license or regulatory approval or the failure to correct serious survey deficiencies identified in compliance surveys could prevent them from continuing operations at a property in addition if a property is found out of compliance with the conditions of participation in medicare medicaid or other health care programs the property may be barred from participation in government reimbursement programs any of these occurrences may impair the ability of our operators to meet their obligations to us if we have to replace a barred property operator our ability to replace the operator may be affected by federal and state rules and policies governing changes in control this may result in payment delays an inability to find a replacement operator a significant working capital commitment from us to a new operator or other difficulties 

 

reimbursement 

 

assisted living facilities approximately 23 of our rental revenues for the year ended december 31 2007 were attributable to assisted living facilities the majority of the revenues received by the operators of our assisted living facilities are from private pay sources the remaining revenue source is primarily medicaid under certain waiver programs as a part of the omnibus budget reconciliation act “obra” of 1981 congress established a waiver program enabling some states to offer medicaid reimbursement to assisted living facilities as an alternative to institutional longterm care services the provisions of obra and the subsequent obra acts of 1987 and 1990 permit states to seek a waiver from typical medicaid requirements to develop costeffective alternatives to longterm care including medicaid payments for assisted living and home health at december 31 2007 five of our 24 assisted living operators received medicaid reimbursement pursuant to medicaid waiver programs for the twelve months ended september 30 2007 approximately 12 of the revenues at our assisted living facilities were from medicaid reimbursement there can be no guarantee that a state medicaid program operating pursuant to a waiver will be able to maintain its waiver status if a state loses its waiver status under medicaid the state will be unable to maintain medicaid reimbursement to assisted living facilities which will reduce the revenues of some of our operators making it more difficult for such operators to cover expenses including our rent or debt service 

rates paid by selfpay residents are set by the facilities and are largely determined by local market conditions and operating costs generally facilities receive a higher payment per day for a private pay resident than for a medicaid beneficiary who requires a comparable level of care the level of medicaid reimbursement varies from state to state thus the revenues generated by operators of our assisted living facilities may be adversely affected by payor mix acuity level and changes in medicaid eligibility and reimbursement levels in addition a state could lose its medicaid waiver and no longer be permitted to utilize medicaid dollars to reimburse for assisted living services changes in revenues could in turn have a material adverse effect on an operator’s ability to meet its obligations to us 

 

skilled nursing facilities and specialty care facilities skilled nursing and specialty care facilities typically receive most of their revenues from medicare and medicaid with the balance representing private pay including private insurance consequently changes in federal or state reimbursement policies may also adversely affect an operator’s ability to cover its expenses including our rent or debt service skilled nursing and specialty care facilities are subject to periodic pre and postpayment reviews and other audits by federal and state authorities a review or audit of claims of a property operator could result in recoupments denials or delays of payments in the future which could have a material adverse effect on the operator’s ability to meet its obligations to us due to the significant judgments and estimates inherent in payor settlement accounting no assurance can be given as to the adequacy of any reserves maintained by our property operators for potential adjustments to reimbursements for payor settlements due to budgetary constraints governmental payors may limit or reduce payments to skilled nursing and specialty care facilities as a result of government reimbursement programs being subject to such budgetary pressures and legislative and administrative actions an operator’s ability to meet its obligations to us may be significantly impaired 

 

medicare reimbursement and skilled nursing facilities for the twelve months ended september 30 2007 approximately 29 of the revenues at our skilled nursing facilities which comprised 32 of our rental revenues for the year ended december 31 2007 were from medicare reimbursement in an effort to reduce federal spending on health care the balanced budget act of 1997 “bba” fundamentally altered medicare payment methodologies for skilled nursing facilities by mandating the institution of the skilled nursing facility prospective payment system the prospective payment system shifted reimbursement from reasonable cost to a prospective fee schedule that generally reduced medicare reimbursement for skilled nursing facility services the reductions in medicare payments resulted in immediate financial difficulties for skilled nursing facilities and caused a number of operators to seek bankruptcy protection the federal government subsequently passed legislation to lessen the negative financial impact from the prospective payment system these payment increases have since expired 

 

skilled nursing facilities received a 33 inflationary market basket increase in medicare payments for federal fiscal year 2008 which represents 690 million of additional medicare spending section 5008 of the deficit reduction act of 2005 directs the secretary as defined in that statute to conduct a demonstration program beginning january 1 2008 assessing the costs and outcomes of patients discharged from hospitals in a variety of postacute care settings including skilled nursing facilities the outcome of that demonstration program could lead to changes in medicare coverage and reimbursement for postacute care it is not known how either the demonstration program or any other changes in medicare reimbursement or regulatory obligations that might be proposed might impact tenants of the company’s properties 

 

the bba mandated caps on medicare reimbursement for certain therapy services however congress imposed various moratoriums on the implementation of those caps the moratoriums on the therapy caps for part b outpatient rehabilitation services expired december 31 2005 the annual payment cap of 1810 per patient applies to occupational therapy and a separate 1810 cap applies to speech and physical therapy until june 30 2008 patients exceeding the cap will be able to obtain additional medicare coverage through a waiver program if the therapy is deemed medically necessary if the waiver program is not further extended patients will need to use private funds to pay for the cost of therapy above the caps the waiver has historically been extended 

 

medicare reimbursement and specialty care facilities for the twelve months ended september 30 2007 approximately 39 of the revenues at our specialty care facilities which comprised 5 of our rental revenues for the year ended december 31 2007 were from medicare specialty care facilities generally are reimbursed by medicare under either the diagnosis related group prospective payment system reimbursement methodology for inpatient hospitals or the longterm acute care hospital prospective payment system for longterm acute care hospitals acute care hospitals provide a wide range of inpatient and outpatient services including but not limited 

to surgery rehabilitation therapy and clinical laboratories longterm acute care hospitals provide inpatient services for patients with complex medical conditions that require more intensive care monitoring or emergency support than that available in most skilled nursing facilities 

 

with respect to medicare’s diagnosis related groupoutpatient prospective payment system methodology for regular hospitals reimbursement for inpatient services is on the basis of a fixed prospective rate based on the principal diagnosis of the patient hospitals are at risk to the extent that their costs in treating a specific case exceed the fixed payment the diagnosis related group reimbursement system was significantly changed for 2008 with the expansion of diagnosis groups from 538 to 745 diagnosis related groups to greater reflect severity it is possible that this change in the drg system will adversely impact reimbursement for some of our hospitals in some cases a hospital might be able to qualify for an outlier payment if the hospital’s losses exceed a threshold 

 

medicaid reimbursement medicaid is a major payor source for residents in our skilled nursing and specialty care facilities for the twelve months ended september 30 2007 approximately 52 of the revenues of our skilled nursing facilities and 28 of the revenues of our specialty care facilities were attributable to medicaid payments the federal government and the states share responsibility for financing medicaid the federal matching rate known as the federal medical assistance percentage varies by state based on relative per capita income but is at least 50 in all states on average medicaid is the largest component of total state spending representing approximately 220 of total state spending the percentage of medicaid dollars used for longterm care varies from state to state due in part to different ratios of elderly population and eligibility requirements within certain federal guidelines states have a wide range of discretion to determine eligibility and reimbursement methodology many states reimburse longterm care facilities using fixed daily rates which are applied prospectively based on patient acuity and the historical costs incurred in providing patient care reasonable costs typically include allowances for staffing administrative and general and property and equipment eg real estate taxes depreciation and fair rental 

 

in most states medicaid does not fully reimburse the cost of providing skilled nursing services certain states are attempting to slow the rate of growth in medicaid expenditures by freezing rates or restricting eligibility and benefits states in which we have skilled nursing property investments increased their per diem medicaid rates roughly 33 on average for fiscal year 2008 three of our states have effectively frozen rates for fiscal year 2008 which will impact profitability to the extent that expenses continue to rise in addition medicaid rates may decline if revenues in a particular state are not sufficient to fund budgeted expenditures 

 

the medicare part d drug benefit became effective january 1 2006 the direct impact on nursing facilities is that residents dually eligible for medicare and enrolled in one of the new part d plans and medicaid now may enroll and receive reimbursement for drugs through medicare part d rather than through medicaid part d will result in increased administrative responsibilities for nursing home operators because enrollment in part d is voluntary and residents have the choice of multiple prescription drug plans operators may also experience increased expenses to the extent that patients’ specific prescribed drugs may not be on the part d drug plan formulary for the plan in which specific patients are enrolled 

 

the reimbursement methodologies applied to health care facilities continue to evolve federal and state authorities have considered and may seek to implement new or modified reimbursement methodologies that may negatively impact health care property operations the impact of any such change if implemented may result in a material adverse effect on our skilled nursing and specialty care property operations no assurance can be given that current revenue sources or levels will be maintained accordingly there can be no assurance that payments under a government reimbursement program are currently or will be in the future sufficient to fully reimburse the property operators for their operating and capital expenses as a result an operator’s ability to meet its obligations to us could be adversely impacted 

 

other related laws 

 

skilled nursing and specialty care facilities and assisted living facilities that receive medicaid payments are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations that govern the operations and financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by health care providers certain of these laws prohibit direct or indirect payments of any kind for the purpose of inducing or encouraging the referral of patients for medical products or services reimbursable by governmental programs other laws require providers to furnish only medically necessary 

services and submit to the government valid and accurate statements for each service still other laws require providers to comply with a variety of safety health and other requirements relating to the condition of the licensed property and the quality of care provided sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations may include but are not limited to criminal andor civil penalties and fines and a loss of licensure immediate termination of governmental payments and exclusion from eligibility for any governmental reimbursement in certain circumstances violation of these rules such as those prohibiting abusive and fraudulent behavior with respect to one property may subject other facilities under common control or ownership to sanctions including exclusion from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs in the ordinary course of its business a property operator is regularly subjected to inquiries investigations and audits by federal and state agencies that oversee these laws and regulations 

 

each skilled nursing and specialty care property and any assisted living property that receives medicaid payments is subject to the federal antikickback statute that generally prohibits persons from offering providing soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing of a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal health care program such as the medicare and medicaid programs skilled nursing and specialty care facilities are also subject to the federal ethics in patient referral act of 1989 commonly referred to as the stark law the stark law generally prohibits the submission of claims to medicare for payment if the claim results from a physician referral for certain designated services and the physician has a financial relationship with the health service provider that does not qualify under one of the exceptions for a financial relationship under the stark law similar prohibitions on physician selfreferrals and submission of claims apply to state medicaid programs further skilled nursing and specialty care facilities and assisted living facilities that receive medicaid payments are subject to substantial financial penalties under the civil monetary penalties act and the false claims act and in particular actions under the false claims act’s “whistleblower” provisions private enforcement of health care fraud has increased due in large part to amendments to the false claims act that encourage private individuals to sue on behalf of the government these whistleblower suits by private individuals known as qui tam actions may be filed by almost anyone including present and former patients nurses and other employees some cases have been brought under the federal false claims act asserting claims for treble damages and up to 11000 per claim on the basis of the alleged failure of a nursing facility to meet applicable regulations relating to the operation of the nursing facility prosecutions investigations or whistle blower actions could have a material adverse effect on a property operator’s liquidity financial condition and results of operations which could adversely affect the ability of the operator to meet its obligations to us finally various state false claim and antikickback laws also may apply to each property operator violation of any of the foregoing statutes can result in criminal andor civil penalties that could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its obligations to us 

 

other legislative developments over the past several years including the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” have greatly expanded the definition of health care fraud and related offenses and broadened its scope to include private health care plans in addition to government payors congress also has greatly increased funding for the department of justice federal bureau of investigation and the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services to audit investigate and prosecute suspected health care fraud moreover a significant portion of the billions in health care fraud recoveries over the past several years has also been returned to government agencies to further fund their fraud investigation and prosecution efforts 

 

additionally other hipaa provisions and regulations provide for communication of health information through standard electronic transaction formats and for the privacy and security of health information in order to comply with the regulations health care providers must undergo significant operational and technical changes operators also face significant financial exposure if they fail to maintain the confidentiality of medical records and personal identifiable health information about individuals 

 

in november 2002 the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms an agency of the us department of health and human services began a national nursing home quality initiative nhqi under this initiative historical survey information the nhqi pilot evaluation report and the nhqi overview is made available to the public online the nhqi website provides consumer and provider information regarding the quality of care in nursing homes the data allows consumers providers states and researchers to compare quality information that shows how well nursing homes are caring for their residents’ physical and clinical needs the posted nursing home 

quality measures come from resident assessment data that nursing homes routinely collect on the residents at specified intervals during their stay if the operators of nursing facilities are unable to achieve quality of care ratings that are comparable or superior to those of their competitors they may lose market share to other facilities reducing their revenues and adversely impacting their ability to make rental payments 

 

finally government investigation and enforcement of health care laws has increased dramatically over the past several years and is expected to continue some of these enforcement actions represent novel legal theories and expansions in the application of false claims laws the costs for an operator of a health care property associated with both defending such enforcement actions and the undertakings in settlement agreements can be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its obligations to us 

 

environmental laws 

 

a wide variety of federal state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect health care facility operations or special medical properties under various federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations an owner of real property or a secured lender such as the company may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at under or disposed of in connection with such property as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property the cost of any required remediation removal fines or personal or property damages and the owner’s or secured lender’s liability for such costs could exceed the value of the property andor the assets of the owner or secured lender in addition the presence of such substances or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which in turn would reduce revenues

general 

 

we elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust or “reit” commencing with our first taxable year we intend to continue to operate in such a manner as to qualify as a reit but there is no guarantee that we will qualify or remain qualified as a reit for subsequent years qualification and taxation as a reit depends upon our ability to meet a variety of qualification tests imposed under federal income tax law with respect to income assets distribution level and diversity of share ownership as discussed below under “— qualification as a reit” there can be no assurance that we will be owned and organized and will operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified 

 

in any year in which we qualify as a reit in general we will not be subject to federal income tax on that portion of our reit taxable income or capital gain that is distributed to stockholders we may however be subject to tax at normal corporate rates on any taxable income or capital gain not distributed if we elect to retain and pay 

income tax on our net longterm capital gain stockholders are required to include their proportionate share of our undistributed longterm capital gain in income but they will receive a refundable credit for their share of any taxes paid by us on such gain 

 

despite the reit election we may be subject to federal income and excise tax as follows 

 

  

if we acquire any assets from a corporation which is or has been a “c” corporation in a carryover basis transaction we could be liable for specified liabilities that are inherited from the “c” corporation a “c” corporation is generally defined as a corporation that is required to pay full corporate level federal income tax if we recognize gain on the disposition of the assets during the tenyear period beginning on the date on which the assets were acquired by us then to the extent of the assets’ “builtin gain” ie the excess of the fair market value of the asset over the adjusted tax basis in the asset in each case determined as of the beginning of the tenyear period we will be subject to tax on the gain at the highest regular corporate rate applicable the results described in this paragraph with respect to the recognition of builtin gain assume that the builtin gain assets at the time the builtin gain assets were subject to a conversion transaction either where a “c” corporation elected reit status or a reit acquired the assets from a “c” corporation were not treated as sold to an unrelated party and gain recognized 

 

qualification as a reit 

 

a reit is defined as a corporation trust or association 

 

 14 

 

  

conditions 1 to 4 inclusive must be met during the entire taxable year and condition 5 must be met during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months for purposes of conditions 5 and 6 pension funds and certain other taxexempt entities are treated as individuals subject to a “lookthrough” exception in the case of condition 6 

 

based on publicly available information we believe we have satisfied the share ownership requirements set forth in 5 and 6 above in addition article vi of our amended and restated bylaws provides for restrictions regarding ownership and transfer of shares these restrictions are intended to assist us in continuing to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in 5 and 6 above these restrictions however may not ensure that we will in all cases be able to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in 5 and 6 above 

 

we have complied with and will continue to comply with regulatory rules to send annual letters to certain of our stockholders requesting information regarding the actual ownership of our stock if despite sending the annual letters we do not know or after exercising reasonable diligence would not have known whether we failed to meet the five or fewer requirement we will be treated as having met the five or fewer requirement if we fail to comply with these regulatory rules we will be subject to a monetary penalty if our failure to comply was due to intentional disregard of the requirement the penalty would be increased however if our failure to comply were due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect no penalty would be imposed 

 

we may own a number of properties through wholly owned subsidiaries a corporation will qualify as a “qualified reit subsidiary” if 100 of its stock is owned by a reit and the reit does not elect to treat the subsidiary as a taxable reit subsidiary a “qualified reit subsidiary” will not be treated as a separate corporation and all assets liabilities and items of income deductions and credits of a “qualified reit subsidiary” will be treated as assets liabilities and items as the case may be of the reit a “qualified reit subsidiary” is not subject to federal income tax and our ownership of the voting stock of a qualified reit subsidiary will not violate the restrictions against ownership of securities of any one issuer which constitute more than 10 of the value or total voting power of such issuer or more than 5 of the value of our total assets as described below under “— asset tests” 

 

if we invest in a partnership a limited liability company or a trust taxed as a partnership or as a disregarded entity we will be deemed to own a proportionate share of the partnership’s limited liability company’s or trust’s assets likewise we will be treated as receiving our share of the income and loss of the partnership limited liability company or trust and the gross income will retain the same character in our hands as it has in the hands of the partnership limited liability company or trust these “lookthrough” rules apply for purposes of the income tests and assets tests described below 

 

income tests there are two separate percentage tests relating to our sources of gross income that we must satisfy for each taxable year 

 

  

for taxable years beginning on or before october 22 2004 1 payments to us under an interest rate swap or cap agreement option futures contract forward rate agreement or any similar financial instrument entered into by us to reduce interest rate risk on indebtedness incurred or to be incurred and 2 gain from the sale or other 

disposition of any such investment are treated as income qualifying under the 95 gross income test as to transactions entered into in taxable years beginning after october 22 2004 any of our income from a “clearly identified” hedging transaction that is entered into by us in the normal course of business directly or indirectly to manage the risk of interest rate movements price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings or obligations incurred or to be incurred by us or such other risks that are prescribed by the internal revenue service is excluded from the 95 gross income test in general a hedging transaction is “clearly identified” if 1 the transaction is identified as a hedging transaction before the end of the day on which it is entered into and 2 the items or risks being hedged are identified “substantially contemporaneously” with the hedging transaction an identification is not substantially contemporaneous if it is made more than 35 days after entering into the hedging transaction 

 

rents received by us will qualify as “rents from real property” for purposes of satisfying the gross income tests for a reit only if several conditions are met 

 

  

for taxable years beginning after august 5 1997 a reit has been permitted to render a de minimis amount of impermissible services to tenants and still treat amounts received with respect to that property as rent from real property the amount received or accrued by the reit during the taxable year for the impermissible services with respect to a property may not exceed 1 of all amounts received or accrued by the reit directly or indirectly from the property the amount received for any service or management operation for this purpose shall be deemed to be not less than 150 of the direct cost of the reit in furnishing or rendering the service or providing the management or operation furthermore impermissible services may be furnished to tenants by a taxable reit subsidiary subject to certain conditions and we may still treat rents received with respect to the property as rent from real property 

 

the term “interest” generally does not include any amount if the determination of the amount depends in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person although an amount generally will not be excluded from the term “interest” solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage of receipts or sales 

 

if we fail to satisfy one or both of the 75 or 95 gross income tests for any taxable year we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for such year if we are eligible for relief for taxable years beginning on or before october 22 2004 these relief provisions generally will be available if 1 our failure to meet such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect 2 we attach a schedule of the sources of our income to our return and 3 any incorrect information on the schedule was not due to fraud with intent to evade tax for taxable years beginning after october 22 2004 these relief provisions generally will be available if 1 following our identification of the failure we file a schedule for such taxable year describing each item of our gross income and 2 the failure to meet such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect 

 

it is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions if these relief provisions apply a 100 tax is imposed on an amount equal to a the gross income attributable to 1 75 of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75 income test and 2 95 of our gross income 90 of our gross income for taxable years beginning on or before 

october 22 2004 over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 95 income test multiplied by b a fraction intended to reflect our profitability 

 

asset tests within 30 days after the close of each quarter of our taxable year we must also satisfy several tests relating to the nature and diversification of our assets determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles at least 75 of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets cash cash items including receivables arising in the ordinary course of our operation government securities and qualified temporary investments although the remaining 25 of our assets generally may be invested without restriction we are prohibited from owning securities representing more than 10 of either the vote the “10 vote test” or value the “10 value test” of the outstanding securities of any issuer other than a qualified reit subsidiary another reit or a taxable reit subsidiary further no more than 20 of the total assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries the “20 asset test” and no more than 5 of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities of any nongovernmental issuer other than a qualified reit subsidiary the “5 asset test” another reit or a taxable reit subsidiary each of the 10 vote test the 10 value test and the 20 and 5 asset tests must be satisfied at the end of each quarter there are special rules which provide relief if the value related tests are not satisfied due to changes in the value of the assets of a reit 

 

for taxable years beginning after december 31 2000 certain items are excluded from the 10 value test including 1 straight debt securities of an issuer including straight debt that provides certain contingent payments 2 any loan to an individual or an estate 3 any rental agreement described in section 467 of the internal revenue code other than with a “related person” 4 any obligation to pay rents from real property 5 certain securities issued by a state or any subdivision thereof the district of columbia a foreign government or any political subdivision thereof or the commonwealth of puerto rico 6 any security issued by a reit and 7 any other arrangement that as determined by the secretary of the treasury is excepted from the definition of security “excluded securities” special rules apply to straight debt securities issued by corporations and entities taxable as partnerships for federal income tax purposes if a reit or its taxable reit subsidiary holds 1 straight debt securities of a corporate or partnership issuer and 2 securities of such issuer that are not excluded securities and have an aggregate value greater than 1 of such issuer’s outstanding securities the straight debt securities will be included in the 10 value test 

 

for taxable years beginning after december 31 2000 a reit’s interest as a partner in a partnership is not treated as a security for purposes of applying the 10 value test to securities issued by the partnership further any debt instrument issued by a partnership will not be a security for purposes of applying the 10 value test 1 to the extent of the reit’s interest as a partner in the partnership and 2 if at least 75 of the partnership’s gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions would qualify for the 75 gross income test for taxable years beginning after october 22 2004 for purposes of the 10 value test a reit’s interest in a partnership’s assets is the reit’s proportionate interest in any securities issued by the partnership other than the excluded securities described in the preceding paragraph 

 

with respect to corrections of failures for which the requirements for corrections are satisfied after october 22 2004 regardless of whether such failures occurred in taxable years beginning on before or after such date as to violations of the 10 vote test the 10 value test or the 5 asset test a reit may avoid disqualification as a reit by disposing of sufficient assets to cure a violation that does not exceed the lesser of 1 of the reit’s assets at the end of the relevant quarter or 10000000 provided that the disposition occurs within six months following the last day of the quarter in which the reit first identified the assets for violations of any of the reit asset tests due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that exceed the thresholds described in the preceding sentence a reit can avoid disqualification as a reit after the close of a taxable quarter by taking certain steps including disposition of sufficient assets within the six month period described above to meet the applicable asset test paying a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets during the period of time that the assets were held as nonqualifying assets and filing a schedule with the internal revenue service that describes the nonqualifying assets 

 

investments in taxable reit subsidiaries for taxable years beginning after december 31 2000 reits may own more than 10 of the voting power and value of securities in taxable reit subsidiaries we and any taxable corporate entity in which we own an interest are allowed to jointly elect to treat such entity as a “taxable reit subsidiary” 

certain of our subsidiaries have elected to be treated as a taxable reit subsidiary taxable reit subsidiaries are subject to full corporate level federal taxation on their earnings but are permitted to engage in certain types of activities that cannot be performed directly by reits without jeopardizing their reit status our taxable reit subsidiaries will attempt to minimize the amount of these taxes but there can be no assurance whether or the extent to which measures taken to minimize taxes will be successful to the extent our taxable reit subsidiaries are required to pay federal state or local taxes the cash available for distribution as dividends to us from our taxable reit subsidiaries will be reduced 

 

the amount of interest on relatedparty debt that a taxable reit subsidiary may deduct is limited further a 100 tax applies to any interest payments by a taxable reit subsidiary to its affiliated reit to the extent the interest rate is not commercially reasonable a taxable reit subsidiary is permitted to deduct interest payments to unrelated parties without any of these restrictions 

 

the internal revenue service may reallocate costs between a reit and its taxable reit subsidiary where there is a lack of arm’slength dealing between the parties any deductible expenses allocated away from a taxable reit subsidiary would increase its tax liability further any amount by which a reit understates its deductions and overstates those of its taxable reit subsidiary will subject to certain exceptions be subject to a 100 tax additional taxable reit subsidiary elections may be made in the future for additional entities in which we own an interest 

 

annual distribution requirements in order to avoid being taxed as a regular corporation we are required to make distributions other than capital gain distributions to our stockholders which qualify for the dividends paid deduction in an amount at least equal to 1 the sum of i 90 of our “reit taxable income” computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain and ii 90 of the aftertax net income if any from foreclosure property minus 2 a portion of certain items of noncash income these distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for that year and if paid on or before the first regular distribution payment after such declaration the amount distributed must not be preferential this means that every stockholder of the class of stock to which a distribution is made must be treated the same as every other stockholder of that class and no class of stock may be treated otherwise than in accordance with its dividend rights as a class to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our “reit taxable income” as adjusted we will be subject to tax on the undistributed amount at regular corporate tax rates finally as discussed above we may be subject to an excise tax if we fail to meet certain other distribution requirements we intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy these annual distribution requirements 

 

it is possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90 distribution requirement or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation due to among other things 1 timing differences between i the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses and ii the inclusion of income and deduction of expenses in arriving at our taxable income or 2 the payment of severance benefits that may not be deductible to us in the event that timing differences occur we may find it necessary to arrange for borrowings or if possible pay dividends in the form of taxable stock dividends in order to meet the distribution requirement 

 

under certain circumstances in the event of a deficiency determined by the internal revenue service we may be able to rectify a resulting failure to meet the distribution requirement for a year by paying “deficiency dividends” to stockholders in a later year which may be included in our deduction for distributions paid for the earlier year thus we may be able to avoid being taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency distributions however we will be required to pay applicable penalties and interest based upon the amount of any deduction taken for deficiency distributions 

 

failure to qualify as a reit 

 

if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates distributions to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify as a reit will not be deductible nor will any particular amount of distributions be required to be made in any year all distributions to stockholders will be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these distributions and subject to 

certain limitations will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporate stockholders unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions we also will be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to statutory relief failure to qualify for even one year could result in our need to incur indebtedness or liquidate investments in order to pay potentially significant resulting tax liabilities 

 

in addition to the relief described above under “— income tests” and “— asset tests” relief is available in the event that we violate a provision of the internal revenue code that would result in our failure to qualify as a reit if 1 the violation is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect 2 we pay a penalty of 50000 for each failure to satisfy the provision and 3 the violation does not include a violation described under “— income tests” or “— asset tests” above it is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions 

 

federal income taxation of holders of our stock 

 

treatment of taxable us stockholders the following summary applies to you only if you are a “us stockholder” a “us stockholder” is a stockholder of shares of stock who for united states federal income tax purposes is 

 

  

so long as we qualify for taxation as a reit distributions on shares of our stock made out of the current or accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these distributions and not designated as capital gain dividends will be includable as ordinary income for federal income tax purposes none of these distributions will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for us corporate stockholders 

 

generally for taxable years ending after may 6 2003 through december 31 2010 the maximum marginal rate of tax payable by individuals on dividends received from corporations that are subject to a corporate level of tax is 15 except in limited circumstances this tax rate will not apply to dividends paid to you by us on our shares because generally we are not subject to federal income tax on the portion of our reit taxable income or capital gains distributed to our stockholders the reduced maximum federal income tax rate will apply to that portion if any of dividends received by you with respect to our shares that are attributable to 1 dividends received by us from nonreit corporations or other taxable reit subsidiaries 2 income from the prior year with respect to which we were required to pay federal corporate income tax during the prior year if for example we did not distribute 100 of our reit taxable income for the prior year or 3 the amount of any earnings and profits that were distributed by us and accumulated in a nonreit year 

 

distributions that are designated as capital gain dividends will be taxed as longterm capital gains to the extent they do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year without regard to the period for which you held our stock however if you are a corporation you may be required to treat a portion of some capital gain dividends as ordinary income 

 

if we elect to retain and pay income tax on any net longterm capital gain you would include in income as longterm capital gain your proportionate share of this net longterm capital gain you would also receive a refundable tax credit for your proportionate share of the tax paid by us on such retained capital gains and you would have an increase in the basis of your shares of our stock in an amount equal to your includable capital gains less your share of the tax deemed paid 

 

you may not include in your federal income tax return any of our net operating losses or capital losses federal income tax rules may also require that certain minimum tax adjustments and preferences be apportioned to you in addition any distribution declared by us in october november or december of any year on a specified date in any 

such month shall be treated as both paid by us and received by you on december 31 of that year provided that the distribution is actually paid by us no later than january 31 of the following year 

 

we will be treated as having sufficient earnings and profits to treat as a dividend any distribution up to the amount required to be distributed in order to avoid imposition of the 4 excise tax discussed under “— general” and “— qualification as a reit — annual distribution requirements” above as a result you may be required to treat as taxable dividends certain distributions that would otherwise result in a taxfree return of capital moreover any “deficiency dividend” will be treated as a dividend an ordinary dividend or a capital gain dividend as the case may be regardless of our earnings and profits any other distributions in excess of current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to you to the extent these distributions do not exceed the adjusted tax basis of your shares of our stock you will be required to reduce the tax basis of your shares of our stock by the amount of these distributions until the basis has been reduced to zero after which these distributions will be taxable as capital gain if the shares of our stock are held as a capital asset the tax basis as so reduced will be used in computing the capital gain or loss if any realized upon sale of the shares of our stock any loss upon a sale or exchange of shares of our stock which were held for six months or less after application of certain holding period rules will generally be treated as a longterm capital loss to the extent you previously received capital gain distributions with respect to these shares of our stock 

 

upon the sale or exchange of any shares of our stock to or with a person other than us or a sale or exchange of all shares of our stock whether actually or constructively owned with us you will generally recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your adjusted tax basis in these shares of our stock this gain will be capital gain if you held these shares of our stock as a capital asset 

 

if we redeem any of your shares in us the treatment can only be determined on the basis of particular facts at the time of redemption in general you will recognize gain or loss as opposed to dividend income equal to the difference between the amount received by you in the redemption and your adjusted tax basis in your shares redeemed if such redemption results in a “complete termination” of your interest in all classes of our equity securities is a “substantially disproportionate redemption” or is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” with respect to you in applying these tests there must be taken into account your ownership of all classes of our equity securities eg common stock preferred stock depositary shares and warrants you also must take into account any equity securities that are considered to be constructively owned by you 

 

if as a result of a redemption by us of your shares you no longer own either actually or constructively any of our equity securities or only own actually and constructively an insubstantial percentage of our equity securities then it is probable that the redemption of your shares would be considered “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” and thus would result in gain or loss to you however whether a distribution is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” depends on all of the facts and circumstances and if you rely on any of these tests at the time of redemption you should consult your tax advisor to determine their application to the particular situation 

 

generally if the redemption does not meet the tests described above then the proceeds received by you from the redemption of your shares will be treated as a distribution taxable as a dividend to the extent of the allocable portion of current or accumulated earnings and profits if the redemption is taxed as a dividend your adjusted tax basis in the redeemed shares will be transferred to any other shareholdings in us that you own if you own no other shareholdings in us under certain circumstances such basis may be transferred to a related person or it may be lost entirely 

 

gain from the sale or exchange of our shares held for more than one year is taxed at a maximum longterm capital gain rate which is currently 15 pursuant to internal revenue service guidance we may classify portions of our capital gain dividends as gains eligible for the longterm capital gains rate or as gain taxable to individual stockholders at a maximum rate of 25 

 

treatment of taxexempt us stockholders taxexempt entities including qualified employee pension and profit sharing trusts and individual retirement accounts “exempt organizations” generally are exempt from federal income taxation however they are subject to taxation on their unrelated business taxable income “ubti” the internal revenue service has issued a published revenue ruling that dividend distributions from a reit to an exempt employee pension trust do not constitute ubti provided that the shares of the reit are not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business of the exempt employee pension trust based on this ruling amounts distributed by us to exempt organizations generally should not constitute ubti however if an exempt organization finances its 

acquisition of the shares of our stock with debt a portion of its income from us will constitute ubti pursuant to the “debt financed property” rules likewise a portion of the exempt organization’s income from us would constitute ubti if we held a residual interest in a real estate mortgage investment conduit 

 

in addition in certain circumstances a pension trust that owns more than 10 of our stock is required to treat a percentage of our dividends as ubti this rule applies to a pension trust holding more than 10 of our stock only if 1 the percentage of our income that is ubti determined as if we were a pension trust is at least 5 2 we qualify as a reit by reason of the modification of the five or fewer requirement that allows beneficiaries of the pension trust to be treated as holding shares in proportion to their actuarial interests in the pension trust and 3 either i one pension trust owns more than 25 of the value of our stock or ii a group of pension trusts individually holding more than 10 of the value of our stock collectively own more than 50 of the value of our stock 

 

backup withholding and information reporting under certain circumstances you may be subject to backup withholding at applicable rates on payments made with respect to or cash proceeds of a sale or exchange of shares of our stock backup withholding will apply only if you 1 fail to provide a correct taxpayer identification number which if you are an individual is ordinarily your social security number 2 furnish an incorrect taxpayer identification number 3 are notified by the internal revenue service that you have failed to properly report payments of interest or dividends or 4 fail to certify under penalties of perjury that you have furnished a correct taxpayer identification number and that the internal revenue service has not notified you that you are subject to backup withholding 

 

backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients such as corporations and taxexempt organizations you should consult with a tax advisor regarding qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining an exemption backup withholding is not an additional tax rather the amount of any backup withholding with respect to payment to a stockholder will be allowed as a credit against such stockholder’s united states federal income tax liability and may entitle such stockholder to a refund provided that the required information is provided to the internal revenue service in addition withholding a portion of capital gain distributions made to stockholders may be required for stockholders who fail to certify their nonforeign status 

 

taxation of foreign stockholders the following summary applies to you only if you are a foreign person the federal taxation of foreign persons is a highly complex matter that may be affected by many considerations 

 

except as discussed below distributions to you of cash generated by our real estate operations in the form of ordinary dividends but not by the sale or exchange of our capital assets generally will be subject to us withholding tax at a rate of 30 unless an applicable tax treaty reduces that tax and you file with us the required form evidencing the lower rate 

 

in general you will be subject to united states federal income tax on a graduated rate basis rather than withholding with respect to your investment in our stock if such investment is “effectively connected” with your conduct of a trade or business in the united states a corporate foreign stockholder that receives income that is or is treated as effectively connected with a united states trade or business may also be subject to the branch profits tax which is payable in addition to regular united states corporate income tax the following discussion will apply to foreign stockholders whose investment in us is not so effectively connected we expect to withhold united states income tax as described below on the gross amount of any distributions paid to you unless 1 you file an internal revenue service form w8eci with us claiming that the distribution is “effectively connected” or 2 certain other exceptions apply 

 

distributions by us that are attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a united states real property interest will be taxed to you under the foreign investment in real property tax act of 1980 “firpta” as if these distributions were gains “effectively connected” with a united states trade or business accordingly you will be taxed at the normal capital gain rates applicable to a us stockholder on these amounts subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals distributions subject to firpta may also be subject to a branch profits tax in the hands of a corporate foreign stockholder that is not entitled to treaty exemption 

we will be required to withhold from distributions subject to firpta and remit to the internal revenue service 35 of designated capital gain dividends or if greater 35 of the amount of any distributions that could be designated as capital gain dividends in addition if we designate prior distributions as capital gain dividends subsequent distributions up to the amount of the prior distributions not withheld against will be treated as capital gain dividends for purposes of withholding 

 

for taxable years beginning after october 22 2004 any capital gain dividend with respect to any class of stock that is “regularly traded” on an established securities market will be treated as an ordinary dividend if the foreign stockholder did not own more than 5 of such class of stock at any time during the taxable year once this provision takes effect foreign stockholders generally will not be required to report distributions received from us on us federal income tax returns and all distributions treated as dividends for us federal income tax purposes including any capital gain dividend will be subject to a 30 us withholding tax unless reduced under an applicable income tax treaty as discussed above in addition the branch profits tax will no longer apply to such distributions 

 

unless our shares constitute a “united states real property interest” within the meaning of firpta or are effectively connected with a us trade or business a sale of our shares by you generally will not be subject to united states taxation our shares will not constitute a united states real property interest if we qualify as a “domestically controlled reit” we do and expect to continue to qualify as a domestically controlled reit a domestically controlled reit is a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50 in value of its shares is held directly or indirectly by foreign stockholders however if you are a nonresident alien individual who is present in the united states for 183 days or more during the taxable year and certain other conditions apply you will be subject to a 30 tax on such capital gains in any event a purchaser of our shares from you will not be required under firpta to withhold on the purchase price if the purchased shares are “regularly traded” on an established securities market or if we are a domestically controlled reit otherwise under firpta the purchaser may be required to withhold 10 of the purchase price and remit such amount to the internal revenue service 

 

backup withholding tax and information reporting will generally not apply to distributions paid to you outside the united states that are treated as 1 dividends to which the 30 or lower treaty rate withholding tax discussed above applies 2 capital gains dividends or 3 distributions attributable to gain from the sale or exchange by us of us real property interests payment of the proceeds of a sale of stock within the united states or conducted through certain us related financial intermediaries is subject to both backup withholding and information reporting unless the beneficial owner certifies under penalties of perjury that he or she is not a us person and the payor does not have actual knowledge that the beneficial owner is a us person or otherwise established an exemption you may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for refund with the internal revenue service

current and prospective securities holders should recognize that the present federal income tax treatment of an investment in us may be modified by legislative judicial or administrative action at any time and that any such action may affect investments and commitments previously made the rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the internal revenue service and the treasury department resulting in revisions of regulations and revised interpretations of established concepts as well as statutory changes revisions in federal tax laws and interpretations of these laws could adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in us

forwardlooking statements and risk factors 

 

this section discusses the most significant factors that affect our business operations and financial condition it does not describe all risks and uncertainties applicable to us our industry or ownership of our securities if any of the following risks as well as other risks and uncertainties that are not yet identified or that we currently think are not material actually occur we could be materially adversely affected in that event the value of our securities could decline 

 

this annual report on form 10k and the documents incorporated by reference contain statements that constitute “forwardlooking statements” as that term is defined in the federal securities laws these forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to those regarding 

 

  

when we use words such as “may” “will” “intend” “should” “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “estimate” or similar expressions we are making forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties our expected results may not be achieved and actual results may differ materially from our expectations this may be a result of various factors including but not limited to 

 

 26 

 

  

risk factors related to our operators’ revenues and expenses 

 

our investment property operators’ revenues are primarily driven by occupancy medicare and medicaid reimbursement if applicable and private pay rates expenses for these facilities are primarily driven by the costs of labor food utilities taxes insurance and rent or debt service revenues from government reimbursement have and may continue to come under pressure due to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls liability insurance and staffing costs continue to increase for our operators to the extent that any decrease in revenues andor any increase in operating expenses result in a property not generating enough cash to make payments to us the credit of our operator and the value of other collateral would have to be relied upon 

 

risk factors related to obligor bankruptcies 

 

we are exposed to the risk that our obligors may not be able to meet the rent principal and interest or other payments due us which may result in an obligor bankruptcy or insolvency or that an obligor might become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings for other reasons although our operating lease agreements provide us with the right to evict a tenant demand immediate payment of rent and exercise other remedies and our loans provide us with the right to terminate any funding obligation demand immediate repayment of principal and unpaid interest foreclose on the collateral and exercise other remedies the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization an obligor in bankruptcy or subject to insolvency proceedings may be able to limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent in the case of a lease or to receive unpaid principal and interest in the case of a loan and to exercise other rights and remedies 

 

we may be required to fund certain expenses eg real estate taxes and maintenance to preserve the value of an investment property avoid the imposition of liens on a property andor transition a property to a new tenant in some instances we have terminated our lease with a tenant and relet the property to another tenant in some of those situations we have provided working capital loans to and limited indemnification of the new obligor if we cannot transition a leased property to a new tenant we may take possession of that property which may expose us to certain successor liabilities should such events occur our revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely affected 

transfers of health care facilities may require regulatory approvals and these facilities may not have efficient alternative uses 

 

transfers of health care facilities to successor operators frequently are subject to regulatory approvals including change of ownership approvals under certificate of need “con” laws and medicare and medicaid provider arrangements that are not required for transfers of other types of real estate the replacement of an operator could be delayed by the approval process of any federal state or local agency necessary for the transfer of the facility or the replacement of the operator licensed to manage the facility alternatively given the specialized nature of our facilities we may be required to spend substantial time and funds to adapt these properties to other uses if we are unable to timely transfer properties to successor operators or find efficient alternative uses our revenue and operations may be adversely affected 

 

risk factors related to government regulations 

 

our obligors’ businesses are affected by government reimbursement and private payor rates to the extent that an operatortenant receives a significant portion of its revenues from governmental payors primarily medicare and medicaid such revenues may be subject to statutory and regulatory changes retroactive rate adjustments recovery of program overpayments or setoffs administrative rulings policy interpretations payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries government funding restrictions at a program level or with respect to specific facilities and interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing governmental investigations and audits at such property in recent years governmental payors have frozen or reduced payments to health care providers due to budgetary pressures health care reimbursement will likely continue to be of paramount importance to federal and state authorities we cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or effect any future legislative reforms may have on the financial condition of our obligors and properties there can be no assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will be available for services provided by any property operator whether the property receives reimbursement from medicare medicaid or private payors significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on an obligor’s liquidity financial condition and results of operations which could adversely affect the ability of an obligor to meet its obligations to us see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — reimbursement” above 

 

our operators and tenants generally are subject to extensive federal state and local licensure certification and inspection laws and regulations our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with any of these laws could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension or decertification from federal and state health care programs loss of license or closure of the facility such actions may have an effect on our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make lease payments to us and therefore adversely impact us 

 

many of our properties may require a license andor con to operate failure to obtain a license or con or loss of a required license or con would prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by the operators or tenants these events could materially adversely affect our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make rent payments to us state and local laws also may regulate expansion including the addition of new beds or services or acquisition of medical equipment and the construction of health care facilities by requiring a con or other similar approval 

 

risk factors related to liability claims and insurance costs 

 

longterm care property operators skilled nursing facilities assisted living facilities and independent livingcontinuing care retirement communities have experienced substantial increases in both the number and size of patient care liability claims in recent years as a result general and professional liability costs have increased in some markets no assurances can be given that the climate for longterm care general and professional liability insurance will improve in any states where the property operators conduct business insurance companies may reduce or stop writing general and professional liability policies for longterm care facilities thus general and professional liability insurance coverage may be restricted or very costly which may adversely affect the property operators’ future operations cash flows and financial condition and may have a material adverse effect on the property operators’ ability to meet their obligations to us 

 

risk factors related to acquisitions 

 

we are exposed to the risk that some of our acquisitions may not prove to be successful we could encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired properties including contingent liabilities and 

acquired properties might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business if we agree to provide construction funding to an operatortenant and the project is not completed we may need to take steps to ensure completion of the project moreover if we issue equity securities or incur additional debt or both to finance future acquisitions it may reduce our per share financial results these costs may negatively affect our results of operations 

 

risk factors related to environmental laws 

 

under various federal and state laws owners or operators of real estate may be required to respond to the presence or release of hazardous substances on the property and may be held liable for property damage personal injuries or penalties that result from environmental contamination or exposure to hazardous substances we may become liable to reimburse the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination generally such liability attaches to a person based on the person’s relationship to the property our tenants or borrowers are primarily responsible for the condition of the property moreover we review environmental site assessments of the properties that we own or encumber prior to taking an interest in them those assessments are designed to meet the “all appropriate inquiry” standard which we believe qualifies us for the innocent purchaser defense if environmental liabilities arise based upon such assessments we do not believe that any of our properties are subject to material environmental contamination however environmental liabilities may be present in our properties and we may incur costs to remediate contamination which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition or the business or financial condition of our obligors 

 

risk factors related to facilities that require entrance fees 

 

certain of our senior housing facilities require the payment of an upfront entrance fee by the resident a portion of which may be refundable by the operator some of these facilities are subject to substantial oversight by state regulators relating to these funds as a result of this oversight residents of these facilities may have a variety of rights including for example the right to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time and certain lien rights the oversight and rights of residents within these facilities may have an effect on the revenue or operations of the operators of such facilities and therefore may negatively impact us 

 

risk factors related to facilities under construction or development 

 

at any given time we may be in the process of constructing one or more new facilities that ultimately will require a con and license before they can be utilized by the operator for their intended use the operator also will need to obtain medicare and medicaid certification and enter into medicare and medicaid provider agreements or third party payor contracts in the event that the operator is unable to obtain the necessary con licensure certification provider agreements or contracts after the completion of construction there is a risk that we will not be able to earn any revenues on the facility until either the initial operator obtains a license or certification to operate the new facility and the necessary provider agreements or contracts or we can find and contract with a new operator that is able to obtain a license to operate the facility for its intended use and the necessary provider agreements or contracts 

 

in connection with our renovation redevelopment development and related construction activities we may be unable to obtain or suffer delays in obtaining necessary zoning landuse building occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations these factors could result in increased costs or our abandonment of these projects in addition we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms which may render us unable to proceed with our development activities and we may not be able to complete construction and leaseup of a property on schedule which could result in increased debt service expense or construction costs 

 

additionally the time frame required for development construction and leaseup of these properties means that we may have to wait years for significant cash returns because we are required to make cash distributions to our stockholders if the cash flow from operations or refinancing is not sufficient we may be forced to borrow additional money to fund such distributions newly developed and acquired properties may not produce the cash flow that we expect which could adversely affect our overall financial performance 

 

in deciding whether to acquire or develop a particular property we make assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property in particular we estimate the return on our investment based on expected occupancy and rental rates if our financial projections with respect to a new property are inaccurate and the 

property is unable to achieve the expected occupancy and rental rates it may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment our estimate of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove to be inaccurate which may result in our failure to meet our profitability goals additionally we may acquire new properties that are not fully leased and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with that property 

 

we do not know if our tenants will renew their existing leases and if they do not we may be unable to lease the properties on as favorable terms or at all 

 

we cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases at the end of their lease terms which expire at various times through 2029 if these leases are not renewed we would be required to find other tenants to occupy those properties there can be no assurance that we would be able to identify suitable replacement tenants or enter into leases with new tenants on terms as favorable to us as the current leases or that we would be able to lease those properties at all 

 

our ownership of properties through ground leases exposes us to the loss of such properties upon breach or termination of the ground leases 

 

we have acquired an interest in certain of our properties by acquiring a leasehold interest in the property on which the building is located and we may acquire additional properties in the future through the purchase of interests in ground leases as the lessee under a ground lease we are exposed to the possibility of losing the property upon termination of the ground lease or an earlier breach of the ground lease by us 

 

illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties 

 

real estate investments are relatively illiquid our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in economic and other conditions will be limited no assurances can be given that we will recognize full value for any property that we are required to sell for liquidity reasons our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 

risk factors related to reinvestment of sale proceeds 

 

from time to time we will have cash available from 1 the proceeds of sales of our securities 2 principal payments on our loans receivable and 3 the sale of properties including nonelective dispositions under the terms of master leases or similar financial support arrangements we must reinvest these proceeds on a timely basis in properties or in qualified shortterm investments we compete for real estate investments with a broad variety of potential investors this competition for attractive investments may negatively affect our ability to make timely investments on terms acceptable to us delays in acquiring properties may negatively impact revenues and perhaps our ability to make distributions to stockholders 

 

failure to properly manage our rapid growth could distract our management or increase our expenses 

 

we have experienced rapid growth and development in a relatively short period of time and expect to continue this rapid growth in the future our rapid growth has resulted in increased levels of responsibility for our management future property acquisitions could place significant additional demands on and require us to expand our management resources and personnel our failure to manage any such rapid growth effectively could harm our business and in particular our financial condition results of operations and cash flows which could negatively affect our ability to make distributions to stockholders our rapid growth could also increase our capital requirements which may require us to issue potentially dilutive equity securities and incur additional debt 

 

we might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

 

we intend to operate as a reit under the internal revenue code and believe we have and will continue to operate in such a manner if we lose our status as a reit we will face serious tax consequences that will 

substantially reduce the funds available for satisfying our obligations and for distribution to our stockholders for each of the years involved because 

 

  

since reit qualification requires us to meet a number of complex requirements it is possible that we may fail to fulfill them and if we do our earnings will be reduced by the amount of federal taxes owed a reduction in our earnings would affect the amount we could distribute to our stockholders also if we were not a reit we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders since a nonreit is not required to pay dividends to stockholders amounting to at least the sum of 1 85 of our reit ordinary income for the year 2 95 of our reit capital gain income for such year other than capital gain that we elect to retain and pay tax on and 3 any undistributed taxable income from preceding periods see “item 1 — business — federal income tax considerations” for a discussion of the provisions of the internal revenue code that apply to us and the effects of nonqualification 

 

in addition if we fail to qualify as a reit all distributions to stockholders would continue to be treated as dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earning and profits although corporate stockholders may be eligible for the dividends received deduction and individual stockholders may be eligible for taxation at the rates generally applicable to longterm capital gains currently at a maximum rate of 15 with respect to distributions 

 

as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to implement our business strategy and would adversely affect the value of our common stock 

 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to remain qualified as a reit although we believe that we qualify as a reit we cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify or remain qualified as a reit for tax purposes see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations” included in this annual report on form 10k 

 

the 90 annual distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions 

 

to comply with the 90 distribution requirement applicable to reits and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax we must make distributions to our stockholders see “item 1 — business — taxation — federal income tax considerations — qualification as a reit — annual distribution requirements” included in this annual report on form 10k although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the reit distribution requirement it is possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90 distribution requirement or we may decide to retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation this may be due to the timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses on the one hand and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income on the other hand in addition nondeductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of noncash deductions also may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90 distribution requirement in the event that timing differences occur or we deem it appropriate to retain cash we may borrow funds issue additional equity securities although we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so pay taxable stock dividends if possible distribute other property or securities or engage in a transaction intended to enable us to meet the reit distribution requirements this may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations 

 

other risk factors 

 

we are also subject to other risks first our second restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain antitakeover provisions staggered board provisions restrictions on share ownership and transfer and super majority stockholder approval requirements for business combinations that could make it 

more difficult for or even prevent a third party from acquiring us without the approval of our incumbent board of directors provisions and agreements that inhibit or discourage takeover attempts could reduce the market value of our common stock 

 

additionally we are dependent on key personnel although we have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers losing any one of them could at least temporarily have an adverse impact on our operations we believe that losing more than one would have a material adverse impact on our business

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

the following discussion and analysis is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of health care reit inc for the periods presented and should be read together with the notes thereto contained in this annual report on form 10k other important factors are identified in “item 1 — business” and “item 1a — risk factors” above 

 

executive overview 

 

business 

 

health care reit inc is an equity real estate investment trust that invests in the full spectrum of senior housing and health care real estate founded in 1970 we were the first reit to invest exclusively in health care properties the following table summarizes our portfolio as of december 31 2007 

 

 

 

 

  

our primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and enhance stockholder value we seek to pay consistent cash dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual increases in rental and interest income and portfolio growth to meet these objectives we invest across the full spectrum of senior housing and health care real estate and diversify our investment portfolio by property type operatortenant and geographic location 

 

substantially all of our revenues and sources of cash flows from operations are derived from operating lease rentals and interest earned on outstanding loans receivable these items represent our primary source of liquidity to fund distributions and are dependent upon our obligors’ continued ability to make contractual rent and interest payments to us to the extent that our obligors experience operating difficulties and are unable to generate sufficient cash to make payments to us there could be a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity andor financial condition to mitigate this risk we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property and operatortenant our asset management process includes review of monthly financial statements for each property periodic review of obligor credit periodic property inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure real estate taxes letters of credit and other collateral in monitoring our portfolio our personnel use a proprietary database to collect and analyze propertyspecific data additionally we conduct extensive research to ascertain industry trends and risks through these asset management and research efforts we are typically able to intervene at an early stage to address payment risk and in so doing support both the collectibility of revenue and the value of our investment 

 

in addition to our asset management and research efforts we also structure our investments to help mitigate payment risk operating leases and loans are normally credit enhanced by guaranties andor letters of credit in addition operating leases are typically structured as master leases and loans are generally crossdefaulted and crosscollateralized with other loans operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its affiliates 

 

for the year ended december 31 2007 rental income and interest income represented 93 and 5 respectively of total gross revenues including discontinued operations substantially all of our operating leases are designed with either fixed or contingent escalating rent structures leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straightline basis over the initial lease period subject to a collectibility assessment rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments 

due for the period our yield on loans receivable depends upon a number of factors including the stated interest rate the average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments 

 

depending upon the availability and cost of external capital we anticipate investing in additional properties new investments are generally funded from temporary borrowings under our unsecured line of credit arrangement internally generated cash and the proceeds from sales of real property our investments generate internal cash from rent and interest receipts and principal payments on loans receivable permanent financing for future investments which replaces funds drawn under the unsecured line of credit arrangement is expected to be provided through a combination of public and private offerings of debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt we believe our liquidity and various sources of available capital are sufficient to fund operations meet debt service obligations both principal and interest make dividend distributions and finance future investments 

 

depending upon market conditions we believe that new investments will be available in the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to our stockholders we expect to complete gross new investments of 900000000 to 1200000000 in 2008 including acquisitions of 500000000 to 700000000 and funded new development of 400000000 to 500000000 we anticipate the sale of real property and the repayment of loans receivable totaling approximately 100000000 to 200000000 during 2008 it is possible that additional loan repayments or sales of real property may occur in the future to the extent that loan repayments and real property sales exceed new investments our revenues and cash flows from operations could be adversely affected we expect to reinvest the proceeds from any loan repayments and real property sales in new investments to the extent that new investment requirements exceed our available cash onhand we expect to borrow under our unsecured line of credit arrangement at december 31 2007 we had 30269000 of cash and cash equivalents and 843000000 of available borrowing capacity under our unsecured line of credit arrangement our investment activity may exceed our borrowing capacity under our unsecured line of credit to the extent that we are unable to issue equity or debt securities to provide additional capital we may not be able to fund all of our potential investments which could have an adverse effect on our revenues and cash flows from operations 

 

key transactions in 2007 

 

we completed the following key transactions during the year ended december 31 2007 

 

  

windrose medical properties trust merger 

 

as discussed in our annual report on form 10ka for the year ended december 31 2006 we completed our merger with windrose medical properties trust on december 20 2006 these operations are the principal component of our operating property segment the results of operations for this segment represent the primary change in our consolidated results of operations from the prior year allocation of the purchase price has been finalized see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

rendinaparamount acquisition 

 

in may 2007 we completed the acquisition of 17 medical office buildings and paramount real estate services a property management company from affiliates of rendina companies the results of operations for these properties and paramount have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition allocation of the purchase price has been finalized see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 

key performance indicators trends and uncertainties 

 

we utilize several key performance indicators to evaluate the various aspects of our business these indicators are discussed below and relate to operating performance credit strength and concentration risk management uses these key performance indicators to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results and in making operating decisions 

 

operating performance we believe that net income available to common stockholders “nics” is the most appropriate earnings measure other useful supplemental measures of our operating performance include funds from operations “ffo” and funds available for distribution “fad” however these supplemental measures are not defined by us generally accepted accounting principals “us gaap” please refer to the section entitled “nongaap financial measures” for further discussion of ffo and fad and for reconciliations of ffo and fad to nics these earning measures and their relative per share amounts are widely used by investors and analysts in the valuation comparison and investment recommendations of reits the following table reflects the recent historical trends of our operating performance measures in thousands except per share data 

 

 

 

credit strength we measure our credit strength both in terms of leverage ratios and coverage ratios our leverage ratios include debt to book capitalization debt to undepreciated book capitalization and debt to market capitalization the leverage ratios indicate how much of our balance sheet capitalization is related to total debt our coverage ratios include interest coverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio the coverage ratios indicate our ability to service interest and fixed charges interest plus preferred dividends and secured debt principal amortizations we expect to maintain capitalization ratios and coverage ratios sufficient to maintain investment grade ratings with moody’s investors service standard  poor’s ratings services and fitch ratings the coverage ratios are based on earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” which is discussed in further detail and reconciled to net income below in “nongaap financial measures” leverage ratios and coverage ratios are widely used by investors analysts and rating agencies in the valuation comparison investment recommendations and rating of companies the following table reflects the recent historical trends for our credit strength measures 

 

 

 

concentration risk we evaluate our concentration risk in terms of asset mix investment mix customer mix and geographic mix concentration risk is a valuable measure in understanding what portion of our investments could be at risk if certain sectors were to experience downturns asset mix measures the portion of our investments 

that are real property in order to qualify as an equity reit at least 75 of our real estate investments must be real property whereby each property which includes the land buildings improvements intangibles and related rights is owned by us and leased to an operator pursuant to a longterm operating lease investment mix measures the portion of our investments that relate to our various property types customer mix measures the portion of our investments that relate to our top five customers geographic mix measures the portion of our investments that relate to our top five states the following table reflects our recent historical trends of concentration risk 

 

 

 

we evaluate our key performance indicators in conjunction with current expectations to determine if historical trends are indicative of future results our expected results may not be achieved and actual results may differ materially from our expectations management regularly monitors various economic and other factors to develop strategic and tactical plans designed to improve performance and maximize our competitive position our ability to achieve our financial objectives is dependent upon our ability to effectively execute these plans and to appropriately respond to emerging economic and companyspecific trends please refer to “item 1a — risk factors” above for further discussion 

 

portfolio update 

 

investment properties 

 

payment coverage of the operators in our investment property portfolio continues to improve our overall payment coverage is at 199 times and represents an increase of six basis point from 2006 and seven basis points from 2005 the following table reflects our recent historical trends of portfolio coverage coverage data reflects the 12 months ended for the periods presented cbmf represents the ratio of facilities’ earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and management fees to contractual rent or interest due us camf represents the 

ratio of earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and rent but after imputed management fees to contractual rent or interest due us 

 

 

 

operating properties 

 

the primary performance measure for our operating properties is net operating income “noi” as discussed below in nongaap financial measures at december 31 2007 we had 121 medical office buildings and four specialty care facilities in our operating properties portfolio our consolidated financial results for the year ended december 31 2006 include twelve days of revenues and expenses from operating properties due to the windrose merger completed on december 20 2006 the following table summarizes and reconciles our net operating income for the periods indicated in thousands

liquidity and capital resources 

 

sources and uses of cash 

 

our primary sources of cash include rent and interest receipts borrowings under our unsecured line of credit arrangement public and private offerings of debt and equity securities proceeds from the sales of real property and principal payments on loans receivable our primary uses of cash include dividend distributions debt service payments including principal and interest real property acquisitions loan advances and general and administrative expenses these sources and uses of cash are reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows and are discussed in further detail below 

the following is a summary of our sources and uses of cash flows dollars in thousands

executive officers with supplemental deferred retirement benefits the serp provides an opportunity for participants to receive retirement benefits that cannot be paid under our taxqualified plans because of the restrictions imposed by erisa and the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended benefits are based on compensation and length of service and the serp is unfunded no contributions by the company are anticipated for the 2008 fiscal year benefit payments are expected to total 3290000 during the next five fiscal years and no benefit payments are expected to occur during the succeeding five fiscal years we use a december 31 measurement date for the serp the accrued liability on our balance sheet for the serp was 1915000 at december 31 2007 1597000 at december 31 2006

our debt agreements contain various covenants restrictions and events of default among other things these provisions require us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness create liens and make investments or acquisitions as of december 31 2007 we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our debt agreements none of our debt agreements contain provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by our debt ratings with moody’s investors service and standard  poor’s ratings services however under our unsecured line of credit arrangement these ratings on our senior unsecured notes are used to determine the fees and interest payable 

 

as of february 15 2008 our senior unsecured notes were rated baa2 stable bbb positive and bbb stable by moody’s investors service standard  poor’s ratings services and fitch ratings respectively we plan to manage the company to maintain investment grade status with a capital structure consistent with our current profile any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the noted rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity andor financial condition

the following is a summary of certain items that impact the results of operations for the year ended december 31 2005 

 

 52 

 

the increase in fully diluted average common shares outstanding is primarily the result of the windrose merger public and private common stock offerings and common stock issuances pursuant to our drip the following table represents the changes in outstanding common stock for the period from january 1 2005 to december 31 2007 in thousands 

 

 

 

revenues were comprised of the following dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

the increase in gross revenues is primarily attributable to increased rental income resulting from the acquisitions of new properties from which we receive rent see the discussion of investing activities in “liquidity and capital resources” above for further information certain of our leases contain annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the consumer price index andor changes in the gross operating revenues of the tenant’s properties these escalators are not fixed so no straightline rent is recorded however rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period if gross operating revenues at our facilities andor the consumer price index do not increase a portion of our revenues may not continue to increase sales of real property would offset revenue increases and to the extent that they exceed new acquisitions could result in decreased revenues our leases could renew above or below current rent rates resulting in an increase or decrease in rental income 

 

interest income decreased in 2006 primarily due to recognition of additional interest income of approximately 4523000 in 2005 the additional interest income related to the payoffs of loans that were either on nonaccrual or partial accrual and all contractual interest was received from the borrowers interest income increased in 2007 primarily due to an increase in loans receivable 

expenses were comprised of the following dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

the increase in total expenses is primarily attributable to increases in interest expense property operating expenses the provisions for depreciation and amortization and general and administrative expenses the increases in interest expense are primarily due to higher average borrowings and changes in the amount of capitalized interest offsetting interest expense if we borrow under our unsecured line of credit arrangement issue additional senior unsecured notes or assume additional secured debt our interest expense will increase 

 

the following is a summary of our interest expense dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

the change in interest expense on senior unsecured notes is due to the net effect and timing of issuances and extinguishments in may 2005 we redeemed all of our outstanding 50000000 817 senior unsecured notes due march 2006 we completed a public tender offer for 57670000 of our outstanding 100000000 7625 senior unsecured notes due march 2008 and we redeemed 122500000 of our outstanding 175000000 75 senior unsecured notes due august 2007 in connection with that extinguishment we recorded a 20662000 loss on 

extinguishment of debt in august 2007 we repaid 52500000 of 75 senior unsecured notes at maturity the following is a summary of our senior unsecured notes activity dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

the change in interest expense on secured debt is due to the net effect and timing of assumptions extinguishments and principal amortizations the following is a summary of our secured debt activity dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

the change in interest expense on unsecured lines of credit arrangements is due primarily to changes in average amounts outstanding and fluctuating variable interest rates the following is a summary of our unsecured lines of credit arrangements dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

at december 31 2006 we had 51000000 of trust preferred liability principal outstanding with a fixed annual interest rate of 722 on november 6 2007 we purchased all 50000000 of the outstanding trust preferred securities at par for the purpose of unwinding this financing arrangement and in december 2007 surrendered these securities and the related 1000000 liquidation amount of common securities for cancellation resulting in the satisfaction and discharge of this 51000000 liability in connection with this transaction we recorded a 1081000 gain on extinguishment of debt please see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 

we capitalize certain interest costs associated with funds used to finance the construction of properties owned directly by us the amount capitalized is based upon the borrowings outstanding during the construction period using the rate of interest that approximates our cost of financing our interest expense is reduced by the amount capitalized capitalized interest for the years ended december 31 2005 2006 and 2007 totaled 665000 4470000 and 12526000 respectively 

 

on may 6 2004 we entered into two interest rate swap agreements the “2004 swaps” for a total notional amount of 100000000 to hedge changes in fair value attributable to changes in the libor swap rate of 100000000 of fixed rate debt with a maturity date of november 15 2013 the 2004 swaps were treated as fair 

value hedges for accounting purposes and we utilized the shortcut method to assess effectiveness the 2004 swaps were with highly rated counterparties in which we received a fixed rate of 60 and paid a variable rate based on sixmonth libor plus a spread on september 12 2007 we terminated the 2004 swaps and we received a 2125000 cash settlement the unamortized amount of this settlement at december 31 2007 was 1973000 and is recorded as an adjustment to the hedged item this amount will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the hedged debt using the effective interest method for the years ended december 31 2005 2006 and 2007 we generated 972000 of savings 197000 of losses and 89000 of savings respectively related to the 2004 swaps that were recorded as adjustments of interest expense 

 

on july 2 2007 we entered into two forwardstarting interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of 200000000 that were designated as cash flow hedges of the variability in forecasted interest payments attributable to changes in the libor swap rate on longterm fixed rate debt forecasted to be issued in 2007 the 2007 swaps have the economic effect of fixing 200000000 of our debt at 4913 for five years the 2007 swaps were settled on july 17 2007 which was the date that the forecasted debt was priced the cash settlement value of these contracts at july 17 2007 was 733000 this amount represented the effective portion of the hedges as there was no hedge ineffectiveness therefore the 733000 settlement value was deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” and will be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method the unamortized amount of aoci related to these contracts at december 31 2007 is 668000 for the year ended december 31 2007 we reclassified 65000 out of aoci as a reduction of interest expense 

 

on september 12 2007 we entered into two forwardstarting interest rate swaps the “september 2007 swaps” for a total notional amount of 250000000 to hedge 10 years of interest payments associated with a longterm borrowing that is expected to occur in 2008 the september 2007 swaps each have an effective date of september 12 2008 and a maturity date of september 12 2018 we expect to settle the 2007 swaps when the debt is priced the september 2007 swaps have the economic effect of fixing 250000000 of our future debt at 4469 plus a credit spread for 10 years the september 2007 swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges and we expect the 2007 swaps to be highly effective at offsetting changes in cash flows of interest payments on 250000000 of our future debt due to changes in the libor swap rate therefore effective changes in the fair value of the september 2007 swaps will be recorded in aoci and reclassified to interest expense when the hedged forecasted transactions affect earnings as interest payments are made on the expected debt issuance the ineffective portion of the changes in fair value will be recorded directly in earnings at december 31 2007 the september 2007 swaps were reported at their fair value of 7990000 and are included in other liabilities and aoci 

 

as discussed in our annual report on form 10ka for the year ended december 31 2006 we completed our merger with windrose medical properties trust on december 20 2006 these operations are the principal component of our property operating expenses from the date of acquisition there was no similar activity in the prior periods in addition to a full year of operations for the windrose properties we acquired 28 medical office buildings during the year ended december 31 2007 

 

depreciation and amortization increased primarily as a result of additional investments in properties owned directly by us see the discussion of investing activities in “liquidity and capital resources” above for additional details to the extent that we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future our provision for depreciation and amortization will change accordingly 

 

general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues including revenues from discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2007 were 764 as compared with 826 and 589 for the same periods in 2006 and 2005 the increase from 2005 to 2006 is directly attributable to 5213000 of mergerrelated expenses and 1287000 of accelerated stockbased compensation expenses the increase from 2006 to 2007 is primarily related to the windrose merger completed on december 20 2006 the paramount acquisition completed in may 2007 1750000 of acquisition finders’ fees paid during the three months ended june 30 2007 and costs associated with our initiatives to attract and retain appropriate personnel to achieve our business objectives during the quarter ended june 30 2007 we recorded 1750000 of onetime acquisition finders’ fees paid to former windrose management in connection with the closing of the rendinaparamount transaction these fees relate to services rendered prior to the consummation of the windrose merger in december 2006 due to the recipients’ current employment status with the company the fees have been expensed as compensation rather than included in the purchase price of the acquisition as is typical with such fees 

loan expense represents the amortization of deferred loan costs incurred in connection with the issuance and amendments of debt the change in loan expense is primarily due to costs associated with the issuance of 345000000 of senior unsecured convertible notes in november and december 2006 costs related to the assumption of secured debt in connection with the windrose merger in december 2006 the issuance of 400000000 of senior unsecured convertible notes in july 2007 and costs associated with the extension and expansion of our unsecured line of credit in august 2007 

 

as a result of our quarterly evaluations we concluded that the allowance for loan losses at december 31 2006 remained appropriate as of december 31 2007 the provision for loan losses is related to our critical accounting estimate for the allowance for loan losses and is discussed below in “critical accounting policies” 

 

other items were comprised of the following dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

during the year ended december 31 2007 we sold ten assisted living facilities one independent living facility seven skilled nursing facilities and one parcel of land with carrying values of 83877000 for a net gain of 14437000 these properties generated 1778000 of income after deducting depreciation and interest expense from rental revenue for the year ended december 31 2007 all properties sold subsequent to january 1 2005 generated 290000 and 3828000 of income after deducting depreciation and interest expense from rental revenue for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively please refer to note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

 

the increase in preferred dividends is primarily due to the increase in average outstanding preferred shares the following is a summary of our preferred stock activity 

 

 

 

in conjunction with the acquisition of windrose medical properties trust in december 2006 we issued 2100000 shares of 75 series g cumulative convertible preferred stock these shares have a liquidation value of 2500 per share dividends are payable quarterly in arrears the preferred stock which has no stated maturity may be redeemed by us at a redemption price of 2500 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends on such shares to the redemption date on or after june 30 2010 each series g preferred share is convertible by the holder into our common stock at a conversion price of 3493 equivalent to a conversion rate of 07157 common shares per series g preferred share these shares were recorded at 2958 per share which was deemed to be the fair value at the date of issuance during the year ended december 31 2007 certain holders of our series g preferred stock converted 295800 shares into 211702 shares of our common stock leaving 1804200 of such shares outstanding at december 31 2007 

nongaap financial measures 

 

we believe that net income available to common stockholders as defined by us gaap is the most appropriate earnings measurement however we consider ffo and fad to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with us gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation however since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient in response the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” created ffo as a supplemental measure of operating performance for reits that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income ffo as defined by nareit means net income computed in accordance with us gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures fad represents ffo excluding the net straightline rental adjustments rental income related to abovebelow market leases and amortization of deferred loan expenses and less cash used to fund capital expenditures tenant improvements and lease commissions 

 

in april 2002 the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 145 that requires gains and losses on extinguishment of debt to be classified as income or loss from continuing operations rather than as extraordinary items as previously required under statement no 4 we adopted the standard effective january 1 2003 we have properly reflected the 21484000 or 039 per diluted share of losses on extinguishment of debt for the year ended december 31 2005 and the 1081000 or 001 per diluted share of gains on extinguishment of debt for the year ended december 31 2007 these amounts have not been added back for the calculations of ffo fad or ebitda 

 

ebitda stands for earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization we believe that ebitda along with net income and cash flow provided from operating activities is an important supplemental measure because it provides additional information to assess and evaluate the performance of our operations additionally restrictive covenants in our debt arrangements contain financial ratios based on ebitda we primarily utilize ebitda to measure our interest coverage ratio which represents ebitda divided by total interest and our fixed charge coverage ratio which represents ebitda divided by fixed charges fixed charges include total interest secured debt principal amortization and preferred dividends 

 

ffo fad and ebitda are financial measures that are widely used by investors equity and debt analysts and rating agencies in the valuation comparison rating and investment recommendations of companies management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results and in making operating decisions additionally ffo and fad are utilized by the board of directors to evaluate management ffo fad and ebitda do not represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with us gaap and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity finally ffo fad and ebitda as defined by us may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies 

 

net operating income “noi” is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties we define noi as rental revenues including tenant reimbursements less property level operating expenses which exclude depreciation and amortization general and administrative expenses impairments interest expense and discontinued operations we believe noi provides investors relevant and useful information because it measures the operating performance of our properties at the property level on an unleveraged basis we use noi to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess the property level performance of our properties

critical accounting policies 

 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap which requires us to make estimates and assumptions management considers an accounting estimate or assumption critical if 

 

  

management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating 

to them management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate and are not reasonably likely to change in the future however since these estimates require assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made they bear the risk of change if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations liquidity andor financial condition please refer to note 1 of our audited consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact us there were no material changes to these policies in 2007 

 

the following table presents information about our critical accounting policies as well as the material assumptions used to develop each estimate

impact of inflation 

 

during the past three years inflation has not significantly affected our earnings because of the moderate inflation rate additionally our earnings are primarily longterm investments with fixed rates of return these investments are mainly financed with a combination of equity senior unsecured notes and borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements during inflationary periods which generally are accompanied by rising interest rates our ability to grow may be adversely affected because the yield on new investments may increase at a slower rate than new borrowing costs presuming the current inflation rate remains moderate and longterm interest rates do not increase significantly we believe that inflation will not impact the availability of equity and debt financing for us 

 

tablestart 


 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

we are exposed to various market risks including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates we seek to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates by matching the terms of new investments with new longterm fixed rate borrowings to the extent possible we may or may not elect to use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate exposure these decisions are principally based on our policy to match our variable rate investments with comparable borrowings but are also based on the general trend in interest rates at the applicable dates and our perception of the future volatility of interest rates this section is presented to provide a discussion of the risks associated with potential fluctuations in interest rates 

 

we historically borrow on our unsecured lines of credit arrangements to acquire construct or make loans relating to health care and senior housing properties then as market conditions dictate we will issue equity or longterm fixed rate debt to repay the borrowings under the unsecured lines of credit arrangements 

a change in interest rates will not affect the interest expense associated with our fixed rate debt interest rate changes however will affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt changes in the interest rate environment upon maturity of this fixed rate debt could have an effect on our future cash flows and earnings depending on whether the debt is replaced with other fixed rate debt variable rate debt or equity or repaid by the sale of assets to illustrate the impact of changes in the interest rate markets we performed a sensitivity analysis on our fixed rate debt instruments whereby we modeled the change in net present values arising from a hypothetical 1 increase in interest rates to determine the instruments’ change in fair value the following table summarizes the analysis performed as of the dates indicated in thousands 

 

 

 

 

  

on september 12 2007 we entered into two forwardstarting interest rate swaps “the 2007 swaps” for a total notional amount of 250000000 to hedge 10 years of interest payments associated with a longterm borrowing that is expected to occur in 2008 the 2007 swaps each have an effective date of september 12 2008 and a maturity date of september 12 2018 we expect to settle the 2007 swaps when the debt is priced the 2007 swaps have the economic effect of fixing 250000000 of our future debt at 4469 plus a credit spread for 10 years the 2007 swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges and we expect the 2007 swaps to be highly effective at offsetting changes in cash flows of interest payments on 250000000 of our future debt due to changes in the libor swap rate therefore effective changes in the fair value of the 2007 swaps will be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified to interest expense when the hedged forecasted transactions affect earnings as interest payments are made on the expected debt issuance the ineffective portion of the changes in fair value will be recorded directly in earnings at december 31 2007 the 2007 swaps were reported at their fair value of 7990000 and are included in other liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive income a 1 increase in interest rates would result in an increase in fair value of our 2007 swaps by approximately 10871000 at december 31 2007 

 

our variable rate debt including our unsecured line of credit arrangement is reflected at fair value at december 31 2007 we had 321232000 outstanding related to our variable rate debt and assuming no changes in outstanding balances a 1 increase in interest rates would result in increased annual interest expense of 3212000 at december 31 2006 we had 239552000 outstanding related to our variable rate debt and assuming no changes in outstanding balances a 1 increase in interest rates would have resulted in increased annual interest expense of 2396000 

 

we are subject to risks associated with debt financing including the risk that existing indebtedness may not be refinanced or that the terms of refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of current indebtedness the majority of our borrowings were completed under indentures or contractual agreements that limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur accordingly in the event that we are unable to raise additional equity or borrow money because of these limitations our ability to acquire additional properties may be limited

portfolio of properties 

 

the following table summarizes our portfolio as of december 31 2006 

 

 

 

 

  

property types 

 

our primary property types include investment properties and operating properties investment properties are those in which we do not participate in the management of the property and include skilled nursing facilities assisted living facilities independent livingcontinuing care retirement communities and specialty care facilities our operating properties are those in which we are responsible for the management of the property and are primarily medical office buildings our properties include standalone facilities that provide one level of service combination facilities that provide multiple levels of service and communities or campuses that provide a wide range of services the following is a summary of our various property types 

 

assisted living facilities 

 

assisted living facilities are state regulated rental properties that provide the same services as independent living facilities but also provide supportive care from trained employees to residents who require assistance with activities of daily living including management of medications bathing dressing toileting ambulating and eating 

 

alzheimer’sdementia care facilities certain assisted living facilities may include state licensed settings that specialize in caring for those afflicted with alzheimer’s disease andor similar forms of dementia 

 

skilled nursing facilities 

 

skilled nursing facilities are licensed daily rate or rental properties where the majority of individuals require 24hour nursing andor medical care generally these properties are licensed for medicaid andor medicare reimbursement 

 

independent livingcontinuing care retirement communities 

 

these communities may include one or more of the following property types 

 

continuing care retirement communities continuing care retirement communities include a combination of detached homes an independent living facility an assisted living facility andor a skilled nursing facility on one campus these communities are appealing to residents because there is no need for relocating when health and medical needs change resident payment plans vary but can include entrance fees condominium fees and rental fees 

active adult communities active adult communities contain primarily forsale singlefamily homes townhomes cluster homes mobile homes andor condominiums with no specialized services these communities are typically restricted or targeted to adults at least 55 years of age or older residents generally lead an independent lifestyle communities may include amenities such as a clubhouse golf course and recreational spaces 

 

independent living facilities independent living facilities are agerestricted multifamily properties with central dining facilities that provide residents access to meals and other services such as housekeeping linen service transportation and social and recreational activities 

 

specialty care facilities 

 

our specialty care facilities include acute care hospitals longterm acute care hospitals and other specialty care hospitals acute care hospitals provide a wide range of inpatient and outpatient services including but not limited to surgery rehabilitation therapy and clinical laboratories longterm acute care hospitals provide inpatient services for patients with complex medical conditions that require more intensive care monitoring or emergency support than that available in most skilled nursing facilities other specialty care hospitals provide specialized inpatient and outpatient care for specific illnesses or diseases including among others orthopedic neurosurgical and behavioral care 

 

medical office buildings 

 

medical office buildings are office and clinic facilities often located near hospitals or on hospital campuses specifically constructed and designed for the use of physicians and other health care personnel to provide services to their patients they may also include ambulatory surgery centers that are used for general or specialty surgical procedures not requiring an overnight stay in a hospital medical office buildings typically contain sole and group physician practices and may provide laboratory and other patient services 

 

investments 

 

we invest across the full spectrum of senior housing and health care real estate we diversify our investment portfolio by property type operatortenant and geographic location in determining whether to invest in a property we focus on the following 1 the experience of the tenant’s or borrower’s management team 2 the historical and projected financial and operational performance of the property 3 the credit of the tenant or borrower 4 the security for the lease or loan and 5 the capital committed to the property by the tenant or borrower we conduct market research and analysis for all potential investments in addition we review the value of all properties the interest rates and covenant requirements of any debt to be assumed and the anticipated sources of repayment of any existing debt that is not to be assumed 

 

we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property and operatortenant our asset management process generally includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each property periodic review of obligor creditworthiness periodic property inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure real estate taxes letters of credit and other collateral in monitoring our portfolio our personnel use a proprietary database to collect and analyze propertyspecific data additionally we conduct extensive research to ascertain industry trends and risks 

 

through asset management and research we evaluate the operating environment in each property’s market to determine whether payment risk is likely to increase when we identify unacceptable levels of payment risk we seek to mitigate eliminate or transfer the risk we categorize the risk as obligor property or market risk for obligor risk we typically find a substitute operatortenant to run the property for property risk we usually work with the operatortenant to institute propertylevel management changes to address the risk finally for market risk we often encourage an obligor to change its capital structure including refinancing the property or raising additional equity through these asset management and research efforts we are generally able to intervene at an early stage to address payment risk and in so doing support both the collectibility of revenue and the value of our investment 

 

depending upon market conditions we believe that new investments will be available in the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to our stockholders 

 

investment properties 

 

our investment properties are those in which we do not participate in the management of the property and are primarily land building improvements and related rights that are leased to operators under longterm operating leases the net value of our investment properties aggregated approximately 2823331000 at december 31 2006 the leases generally have a fixed contractual term of 12 to 15 years and contain one or more five to 15year renewal options most of our rents are received under triplenet leases requiring the operator to pay rent and all additional charges incurred in the operation of the leased property the tenants are required to repair rebuild and maintain the leased properties substantially all of these operating leases are designed with either fixed or contingent escalating rent structures leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straightline basis over the initial lease period subject to a collectibility assessment rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period 

 

at december 31 2006 86 of our investment properties were subject to master leases a master lease is a lease of multiple properties to one tenant entity under a single lease agreement from time to time we may acquire additional properties that are then leased to the tenant under the master lease the tenant is required to make one monthly payment that represents rent on all the properties that are subject to the master lease typically the master lease tenant can exercise its right to purchase the properties or to renew the master lease only with respect to all leased properties at the same time this bundling feature benefits us because the tenant cannot limit the purchase or renewal to the better performing properties and terminate the leasing arrangement with respect to the poorer performing properties this spreads our risk among the entire group of properties within the master lease the bundling feature may provide a similar advantage if the master lease tenant is in bankruptcy subject to certain restrictions a debtor in bankruptcy has the right to assume or reject each of its leases it is our intent that a tenant in bankruptcy would be required to assume or reject the master lease as a whole rather than deciding on a property by property basis 

 

we currently provide for the construction of properties for tenants as part of longterm operating leases we capitalize certain interest costs associated with funds used to pay for the construction of properties owned by us the amount capitalized is based upon the amount advanced during the construction period using the rate of interest that approximates our cost of financing our interest expense is reduced by the amount capitalized we also typically charge a transaction fee at the commencement of construction the construction period commences upon funding and terminates upon the earlier of the completion of the applicable property or the end of a specified period during the construction period we advance funds to the tenants in accordance with agreed upon terms and conditions which require among other things site visits by a company representative prior to advancement of funds during the construction period we generally require an additional credit enhancement in the form of payment and performance bonds andor completion guaranties at december 31 2006 we had outstanding construction investments of 138222000 and were committed to providing additional funds of approximately 342754000 to complete construction 

 

hospital affiliates development corporation “hadc” is a taxable reit subsidiary of the company that was incorporated in 1989 in indiana the primary objective of hadc is to develop quality specialty medical properties for the company but hadc also provides a select amount of these services for thirdparties especially those that are expected to be a source of longterm relationships and potential property acquisitions hadc develops and constructs new “buildtosuit” and multitenant facilities hadc earns fees from thirdparties by providing services such as property development facility planning medical equipment planning and implementation services leasing services and property management as a taxable reit subsidiary hadc pays income taxes at regular corporate rates on its taxable income 

 

operating properties 

 

our operating properties are those in which we are responsible for the property and are typically multitenant medical office buildings that are leased to multiple health care providers typically hospitals and physician practices under a gross modified gross or triplenet lease structure under a gross or modified gross lease all or a portion of our operating expenses are not reimbursed by tenants accordingly we incur certain property operating expenses such as real estate taxes repairs and maintenance property management fees utilities and insurance at 

december 31 2006 39 of our owned medical office buildings are managed by a third party property management company at december 31 2006 36 of our operating property leases are leased to multiple tenants under gross or modified gross leases pursuant to which we are responsible for certain operating expenses substantially all of our leases at operating properties include annual base rent escalation clauses that are either predetermined fixed increases or are a function of an inflation index and typically have an initial term ranging from one to 20 years with a weighted average remaining term of approximately five years as of december 31 2006 operating property leases are normally credit enhanced by guaranties andor letters of credit the net value of our operating properties aggregated approximately 974298000 at december 31 2006 

 

mortgage loans 

 

our investments in mortgage loans are typically structured to provide us with interest income principal amortization and transaction fees and are generally secured by a first or second mortgage lien or leasehold mortgage at december 31 2006 we had outstanding mortgage loans of 177615000 the interest yield excluding any loans on nonaccrual averaged approximately 90 per annum on our outstanding mortgage loan balances our yield on mortgage loans depends upon a number of factors including the stated interest rate average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments the mortgage loans outstanding at december 31 2006 are generally subject to three to 20year terms with principal amortization schedules andor balloon payments of the outstanding principal balances at the end of the term typically mortgage loans are crossdefaulted and crosscollateralized with other mortgage loans operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its affiliates 

 

working capital loans 

 

working capital loans are generally either unsecured or secured by the obligor’s leasehold rights corporate guaranties andor personal guaranties these loans have terms generally ranging from three months to ten years at december 31 2006 we had outstanding working capital loans of 16833000 the average interest yield excluding any loans on nonaccrual was approximately 87 per annum on our outstanding working capital loan balances at december 31 2006 we had provided working capital loans to nine obligors 

 

equity investments 

 

equity investments consist primarily of investments in private companies where we do not have the ability to exercise influence under the cost method of accounting investments in private companies are carried at cost and are adjusted only for otherthantemporary declines in fair value distributions of earnings and additional investments for investments in public companies if any that have readily determinable fair market values we classify our equity investments as availableforsale and accordingly record these investments at their fair market values with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income a separate component of stockholders’ equity these investments represent a minimal ownership interest in these companies in connection with the windrose merger we assumed a 1000000 investment in an unconsolidated subsidiary that holds trust preferred securities and is accounted for under the cost method 

 

segment reporting 

 

our business consists of two business segments — investment properties and operating properties for additional information regarding business segments see note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements 

 

borrowing policies 

 

we utilize a combination of debt and equity to fund the purchase of new properties and to provide loan financing our debt and equity levels are determined by management to maintain a conservative credit profile generally we intend to issue unsecured fixed rate public debt with longterm maturities to approximate the maturities on our leases and loans for shortterm purposes we may borrow on our unsecured lines of credit arrangements we replace these borrowings with longterm capital such as senior unsecured notes common stock or preferred stock when terms are deemed favorable we may invest in properties subject to existing mortgage indebtedness in addition we may obtain secured financing for unleveraged properties in which we have invested or 

may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis it is our intent to limit secured indebtedness in our agreements with our lenders we are subject to restrictions with respect to secured and unsecured indebtedness 

 

customer concentrations 

 

the following table summarizes certain information about our customer concentrations as of december 31 2006 dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

competition 

 

we compete with other real estate investment trusts real estate partnerships banks insurance companies finance companies governmentsponsored agencies taxable and taxexempt bond funds and other investors in the acquisition development leasing and financing of health care and senior housing properties we compete for investments based on a number of factors including rates financings offered underwriting criteria and reputation the operatorstenants of our properties compete on a local and regional basis with operatorstenants of properties that provide comparable services operatorstenants compete for patients and residents based on a number of factors including quality of care reputation physical appearance of properties services offered family preferences physicians staff and price we also face competition from other health care facilities for tenants such as physicians and other health care providers that provide comparable facilities and services 

 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2006 we employed 113 fulltime employees 

certain government regulations 

 

health law matters — generally 

 

we invest in assisted living skilled nursing independent living facilitiescontinuing care retirement communities medical office buildings and specialty care facilities which represented approximately 25 34 13 22 and 6 respectively of our investments at december 31 2006 

 

typically operators of assisted living and independent living facilities do not receive significant funding from governmental programs and are regulated by the states not the federal government operators of skilled nursing and specialty care facilities are subject to federal and state laws that regulate the type and quality of the medical andor nursing care provided ancillary services eg respiratory occupational physical and infusion therapies qualifications of the administrative personnel and nursing staff the adequacy of the physical plant and equipment distribution of pharmaceuticals reimbursement and rate setting and operating policies in addition as described below some of our property operators are subject to extensive laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including kickbacks physician selfreferrals and false claims hospitals physician group practice clinics and other health care facilities in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal state and local licensure certification and inspection laws and regulations our tenants’ failure to comply with any of these laws could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension or decertification from federal and state health care programs loss of license or closure of the facility 

 

licensing and certification 

 

the primary regulations that affect assisted living facilities are the states’ licensing laws in granting and renewing these licenses the regulatory authorities consider numerous factors relating to a property’s physical plant and operations including but not limited to admission and discharge standards and staffing and training a decision to grant or renew a license is also affected by a property’s record with respect to consumer rights and medication guidelines and rules 

 

generally our skilled nursing and specialty care facilities are required to be licensed on an annual or biannual basis and to be certified for participation in the medicare and medicaid programs the failure of our operators to maintain or renew any required license or regulatory approval or the failure to correct serious survey deficiencies could prevent them from continuing operations at a property in addition if a property is found out of compliance with the conditions of participation in medicare medicaid or other health care programs the property may be barred from participation in government reimbursement programs any of these occurrences may impair the ability of our operators to meet their obligations to us if we have to replace a property operator our ability to replace the operator may be affected by federal and state rules and policies governing changes in control this may result in payment delays an inability to find a replacement operator a significant working capital commitment from us to a new operator or other difficulties 

 

reimbursement 

 

assisted living facilities approximately 33 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2006 were attributable to assisted living facilities the majority of the revenues received by the operators of our assisted living facilities are from private pay sources the remaining revenue source is primarily medicaid waiver programs as a part of the omnibus budget reconciliation act “obra” of 1981 congress established a waiver program enabling some states to offer medicaid reimbursement to assisted living facilities as an alternative to institutional longterm care services the provisions of obra and the subsequent obra acts of 1987 and 1990 permit states to seek a waiver from typical medicaid requirements to develop costeffective alternatives to longterm care including medicaid payments for assisted living and home health at december 31 2006 seven of our 25 assisted living operators received medicaid reimbursement pursuant to medicaid waivers programs for the twelve months ended september 30 2006 approximately 13 of the revenues at our assisted living facilities were from medicaid reimbursement 

 

rates paid by selfpay residents are set by the facilities and are largely determined by local market conditions and operating costs generally facilities receive a higher payment per day for a private pay resident than for a medicaid beneficiary who requires a comparable level of care the level of medicaid reimbursement varies from 

state to state thus the revenues generated by operators of our assisted living facilities may be adversely affected by payor mix acuity level and changes in medicaid eligibility and reimbursement levels in addition a state could lose its medicaid waiver and no longer be permitted to utilize medicaid dollars to reimburse for assisted living services changes in revenues could in turn have a material adverse effect on an operator’s ability to meet its obligations to us 

 

skilled nursing facilities and specialty care facilities skilled nursing and specialty care facilities typically receive most of their revenues from medicare and medicaid with the balance representing private pay including private insurance consequently changes in federal or state reimbursement policies may also adversely affect an operator’s ability to cover its expenses including our rent or debt service skilled nursing and specialty care facilities are subject to periodic pre and postpayment reviews and other audits by federal and state authorities a review or audit of claims of a property operator could result in recoupments denials or delays of payments in the future which could have a material adverse effect on the operator’s ability to meet its obligations to us due to the significant judgments and estimates inherent in payor settlement accounting no assurance can be given as to the adequacy of any reserves maintained by our property operators for potential adjustments to reimbursements for payor settlements due to budgetary constraints governmental payors may limit or reduce payments to skilled nursing and specialty care facilities as a result of government reimbursement programs being subject to such budgetary pressures and legislative and administrative actions an operator’s ability to meet its obligations to us may be significantly impaired 

 

medicare reimbursement and skilled nursing facilities for the twelve months ended september 30 2006 approximately 29 of the revenues at our skilled nursing facilities which comprised 48 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2006 were from medicare reimbursement in an effort to reduce federal spending on health care the balanced budget act of 1997 “bba” fundamentally altered medicare payment methodologies for skilled nursing facilities by mandating the institution of the skilled nursing property prospective payment system the prospective payment system caused medicare per diem reimbursement for skilled nursing property services to decrease the reductions in medicare payments resulted in immediate financial difficulties for skilled nursing facilities and caused a number of operators to seek bankruptcy protection the federal government subsequently passed legislation to lessen the negative financial impact from the prospective payment system these payment increases have since expired 

 

skilled nursing facilities received a 31 inflationary market basket increase in medicare payments for federal fiscal year 2007 which represents 560 million of additional medicare spending however section 5004 of the deficit reduction act of 2005 “dra” reduced medicare reimbursement to skilled nursing facilities for bad debt costs section 5008 of the dra directs the secretary as defined in that statute to conduct a demonstration program beginning january 1 2008 assessing the costs and outcomes of patients discharged from hospitals in a variety of postacute care settings including skilled nursing facilties home care and other settings the outcome of that demonstration program could lead to significant changes in medicare coverage and reimbursement for postacute care it is not known how either the deomonstration program or as yet unannounced changes in medicare reimbursement might impact tenants of the company’s properties 

 

the moratorium on the therapy caps for part b outpatient rehabilitation services which had applied through december 31 2005 expired the therapy caps were mandated by the bba the annual payment cap of 1780 per patient applies to occupational therapy and a separate 1780 cap applies to speech and physical therapy patients exceeding the cap will be able to obtain additional medicare coverage through a waiver program if the therapy is deemed medically necessary however the program is set to expire in december 2007 otherwise the patient would need to use private funds to pay for the cost of therapy above the caps 

 

medicare reimbursement and specialty care facilities for the twelve months ended september 30 2006 approximately 59 of the revenues at our specialty care facilities which comprised 5 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2006 were from medicare specialty care facilities generally are reimbursed by medicare under either the diagnosis related group prospective payment system reimbursement methodology for inpatient hospitals or the longterm acute care hospital prospective payment system for longterm acute care hospitals acute care hospitals provide a wide range of inpatient and outpatient services including but not limited to surgery rehabilitation therapy and clinical laboratories longterm acute care hospitals provide inpatient services for 

patients with complex medical conditions that require more intensive care monitoring or emergency support than that available in most skilled nursing facilities 

 

with respect to medicare’s diagnosis related groupoutpatient prospective payment system methodology for regular hospitals reimbursement for inpatient services is on the basis of a fixed prospective rate based on the principal diagnosis of the patient diagnoses are grouped into more than 500 diagnosis related groups in some cases a hospital might be able to qualify for an outlier payment if the hospital’s losses exceed a threshold 

 

medicaid reimbursement medicaid is a major payor source for residents in our skilled nursing and specialty care facilities for the twelve months ended september 30 2006 approximately 53 of the revenues of our skilled nursing facilities and 25 of the revenues of our specialty care facilities were attributable to medicaid payments the federal government and the states share responsibility for financing medicaid the federal matching rate known as the federal medical assistance percentage varies by state based on relative per capita income on average medicaid is the largest component of total state spending representing approximately 222 of total state spending the percentage of medicaid dollars used for longterm care varies from state to state due in part to different ratios of elderly population and eligibility requirements with certain federal guidelines states have a wide range of discretion to determine eligibility and reimbursement methodology many states reimburse longterm care facilities using fixed daily rates which are applied prospectively based on patient acuity and the historical costs incurred in providing patient care reasonable costs typically include allowances for staffing administrative and general and property and equipment eg real estate taxes depreciation and fair rental 

 

in most states medicaid does not fully reimburse the cost of providing skilled nursing services certain states are attempting to slow the rate of growth in medicaid expenditures by freezing rates or restricting eligibility and benefits states in which we have skilled nursing property investments increased their per diem medicaid rates roughly 35 on average for fiscal year 2007 four of our states effectively froze rates in fiscal year 2007 which impacts profitability to the extent that expenses continue to rise in addition medicaid rates may decline if revenues in a particular state are not sufficient to fund budgeted expenditures 

 

the medicare part d drug benefit became effective january 1 2006 the direct impact on nursing facilities is that residents dually eligible for medicare and enrolled in one of the new part d plans and medicaid now receive reimbursement for drugs through medicare part d rather than through medicaid participants began enrolling in the new part d prescription drug plans on november 15 2005 part d will result in increased administrative responsibilities for nursing home operators because residents have the choice of multiple prescription drug plans operators may also experience increased expenses to the extent that patients’ drugs are not covered by their prescription drug plan formulary 

 

the reimbursement methodologies applied to health care facilities continue to evolve federal and state authorities have considered and may seek to implement new or modified reimbursement methodologies that may negatively impact health care property operations the impact of any such change if implemented may result in a material adverse effect on our skilled nursing and specialty care property operations no assurance can be given that current revenue sources or levels will be maintained accordingly there can be no assurance that payments under a government reimbursement program are currently or will be in the future sufficient to fully reimburse the property operators for their operating and capital expenses as a result an operator’s ability to meet its obligations to us could be adversely impacted 

 

other related laws 

 

skilled nursing and specialty care facilities and assisted living facilities that receive medicaid payments are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations that govern the operations and financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by health care providers certain of these laws prohibit direct or indirect payments of any kind for the purpose of inducing or encouraging the referral of patients for medical products or services reimbursable by governmental programs other laws require providers to furnish only medically necessary services and submit to the government valid and accurate statements for each service still other laws require providers to comply with a variety of safety health and other requirements relating to the condition of the licensed property and the quality of care provided sanctions for violation of these laws and regulations may include but are not limited to criminal andor civil penalties and fines and a loss of licensure and immediate termination of 

governmental payments in certain circumstances violation of these rules such as those prohibiting abusive and fraudulent behavior with respect to one property may subject other facilities under common control or ownership to sanctions including disqualification from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs in the ordinary course of its business a property operator is regularly subjected to inquiries investigations and audits by federal and state agencies that oversee these laws and regulations 

 

each skilled nursing and specialty care property and any assisted living property that receives medicaid payments is subject to the federal antikickback statute that generally prohibits persons from offering providing soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing of a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal health care program such as the medicare and medicaid programs skilled nursing and specialty care facilities are also subject to the federal ethics in patient referral act of 1989 commonly referred to as the stark law the stark law generally prohibits the submission of claims to medicare for payment if the claim results from a physician referral for certain designated services and the physician has a financial relationship with the health service provider that does not qualify under one of the exceptions for a financial relationship under the stark law similar prohibitions on physician selfreferrals and submission of claims apply to state medicaid programs further skilled nursing and specialty care facilities and assisted living facilities that receive medicaid payments are subject to substantial financial penalties under the civil monetary penalties act and the false claims act and in particular actions under the false claims act’s “whistleblower” provisions private enforcement of health care fraud has increased due in large part to amendments to the false claims act that encourage private individuals to sue on behalf of the government these whistleblower suits by private individuals known as qui tam actions may be filed by almost anyone including present and former patients nurses and other employees recent action under the federal false claims act have asserted claims for treble damages and up to 11000 per claim on the basis of the alleged failure of a property to meet applicable regulations relating to the operation of the property prosecutions investigations or qui tam actions could have a material adverse effect on a property operator’s liquidity financial condition and results of operations which could adversely affect the ability of the operator to meet its obligations to us finally various state false claim and antikickback laws also may apply to each property operator violation of any of the foregoing statutes can result in criminal andor civil penalties that could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its obligations to us 

 

the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 which became effective january 1 1997 greatly expanded the definition of health care fraud and related offenses and broadened its scope to include private health care plans in addition to government payors it also greatly increased funding for the department of justice federal bureau of investigation and the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services to audit investigate and prosecute suspected health care fraud 

 

additionally the administrative simplification provisions of this law provide for communication of health information through standard electronic transaction formats and for the privacy and security of health information in order to comply with the regulations health care providers must undergo significant operational and technical changes 

 

finally government investigation and enforcement of health care laws has increased dramatically over the past several years and is expected to continue some of these enforcement actions represent novel legal theories and expansions in the application of false claims laws the costs for an operator of a health care property associated with both defending such enforcement actions and the undertakings in settlement agreements can be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its obligations to us 

 

environmental laws 

 

a wide variety of federal state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect health care facility operations or special medical properties under various federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations an owner of real property or a secured lender such as the company may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at under or disposed of in connection with such property as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property the cost of any required remediation removal fines or personal or property damages and the owner’s or secured lender’s liability 

therefor could exceed the value of the property andor the assets of the owner or secured lender in addition the presence of such substances or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which in turn would reduce our revenue

general 

 

we elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust or “reit” commencing with our first taxable year we intend to continue to operate in such a manner as to qualify as a reit but there is no guarantee that we will qualify or remain qualified as a reit for subsequent years qualification and taxation as a reit depends upon our ability to meet a variety of qualification tests imposed under federal income tax law with respect to income assets distribution level and diversity of share ownership as discussed below under “— qualification as a reit” there can be no assurance that we will be owned and organized and will operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified 

 

in any year in which we qualify as a reit in general we will not be subject to federal income tax on that portion of our reit taxable income or capital gain that is distributed to stockholders we may however be subject to tax at normal corporate rates on any taxable income or capital gain not distributed if we elect to retain and pay income tax on our net longterm capital gain stockholders are required to include their proportionate share of our undistributed longterm capital gain in income but they will receive a refundable credit for their share of any taxes paid by us on such gain 

 

despite the reit election we may be subject to federal income and excise tax as follows 

 

 13 

 

  

if we acquire any assets from a corporation which is or has been a “c” corporation in a carryover basis transaction we could be liable for specified liabilities that are inherited from the “c” corporation a “c” corporation is generally defined as a corporation that is required to pay full corporate level federal income tax if we recognize gain on the disposition of the assets during the tenyear period beginning on the date on which the assets were acquired by us then to the extent of the assets’ “builtin gain” ie the excess of the fair market value of the asset over the adjusted tax basis in the asset in each case determined as of the beginning of the tenyear period we will be subject to tax on the gain at the highest regular corporate rate applicable the results described in this paragraph with respect to the recognition of builtin gain assume that the builtin gain assets at the time the builtin gain assets were subject to a conversion transaction either where a “c” corporation elected reit status or a reit acquired the assets from a “c” corporation were not treated as sold to an unrelated party and gain recognized 

 

qualification as a reit 

 

a reit is defined as a corporation trust or association 

 

  

4 which is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company 

 

  

conditions 1 to 4 inclusive must be met during the entire taxable year and condition 5 must be met during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months for purposes of conditions 5 and 6 pension funds and certain other taxexempt entities are treated as individuals subject to a “lookthrough” exception in the case of condition 6 

 

based on publicly available information we believe we have satisfied the share ownership requirements set forth in 5 and 6 above in addition article vi of our amended and restated bylaws provides for restrictions regarding ownership and transfer of shares these restrictions are intended to assist us in continuing to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in 5 and 6 above these restrictions however may not ensure that we will in all cases be able to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in 5 and 6 above 

 

we have complied with and will continue to comply with regulatory rules to send annual letters to certain of our stockholders requesting information regarding the actual ownership of our stock if despite sending the annual letters we do not know or after exercising reasonable diligence would not have known whether we failed to meet the five or fewer requirement we will be treated as having met the five or fewer requirement if we fail to comply with these regulatory rules we will be subject to a monetary penalty if our failure to comply was due to intentional disregard of the requirement the penalty would be increased however if our failure to comply were due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect no penalty would be imposed 

 

we may own a number of properties through wholly owned subsidiaries a corporation will qualify as a “qualified reit subsidiary” if 100 of its stock is owned by a reit and the reit does not elect to treat the subsidiary as a taxable reit subsidiary a “qualified reit subsidiary” will not be treated as a separate corporation and all assets liabilities and items of income deductions and credits of a “qualified reit subsidiary” will be treated as assets liabilities and items as the case may be of the reit a “qualified reit subsidiary” is not subject to federal income tax and our ownership of the voting stock of a qualified reit subsidiary will not violate the restrictions against ownership of securities of any one issuer which constitute more than 10 of the value or total voting power of such issuer or more than 5 of the value of our total assets as described below under “— asset tests” 

 

if we invest in a partnership a limited liability company or a trust taxed as a partnership or as a disregarded entity we will be deemed to own a proportionate share of the partnership’s limited liability company’s or trust’s assets likewise we will be treated as receiving our share of the income and loss of the partnership limited liability company or trust and the gross income will retain the same character in our hands as it has in the hands of the partnership limited liability company or trust these “lookthrough” rules apply for purposes of the income tests and assets tests described below 

 

income tests there are two separate percentage tests relating to our sources of gross income that we must satisfy for each taxable year 

 

  

for taxable years beginning on or before october 22 2004 1 payments to us under an interest rate swap or cap agreement option futures contract forward rate agreement or any similar financial instrument entered into by us to reduce interest rate risk on indebtedness incurred or to be incurred and 2 gain from the sale or other disposition of any such investment are treated as income qualifying under the 95 gross income test as to transactions entered into in taxable years beginning after october 22 2004 any of our income from a “clearly identified” hedging transaction that is entered into by us in the normal course of business directly or indirectly to manage the risk of interest rate movements price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings or obligations incurred or to be incurred by us or such other risks that are prescribed by the internal revenue service is excluded from the 95 gross income test in general a hedging transaction is “clearly identified” if 1 the transaction is identified as a hedging transaction before the end of the day on which it is entered into and 2 the items or risks being hedged are identified “substantially contemporaneously” with the hedging transaction an identification is not substantially contemporaneous if it is made more than 35 days after entering into the hedging transaction 

 

rents received by us will qualify as “rents from real property” for purposes of satisfying the gross income tests for a reit only if several conditions are met 

 

  

for taxable years beginning after august 5 1997 a reit has been permitted to render a de minimis amount of impermissible services to tenants and still treat amounts received with respect to that property as rent from real property the amount received or accrued by the reit during the taxable year for the impermissible services with respect to a property may not exceed 1 of all amounts received or accrued by the reit directly or indirectly from the property the amount received for any service or management operation for this purpose shall be deemed to be not less than 150 of the direct cost of the reit in furnishing or rendering the service or providing the management or operation furthermore impermissible services may be furnished to tenants by a taxable reit subsidiary subject to certain conditions and we may still treat rents received with respect to the property as rent from real property 

 

the term “interest” generally does not include any amount if the determination of the amount depends in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person although an amount generally will not be excluded from the term “interest” solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage of receipts or sales 

 

if we fail to satisfy one or both of the 75 or 95 gross income tests for any taxable year we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for such year if we are eligible for relief for taxable years beginning on or before october 22 2004 these relief provisions generally will be available if 1 our failure to meet such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect 2 we attach a schedule of the sources of our income to our return and 3 any incorrect information on the schedule was not due to fraud with intent to evade tax for taxable years beginning after october 22 2004 these relief provisions generally will be available if 1 following our identification of the failure we file a schedule for such taxable year describing each item of our gross income and 2 the failure to meet such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect 

 

it is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions if these relief provisions apply a 100 tax is imposed on an amount equal to a the gross income attributable to 1 75 of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75 income test and 2 95 of our gross income 90 of our gross income for taxable years beginning on or before october 22 2004 over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 95 income test multiplied by b a fraction intended to reflect our profitability 

 

asset tests within 30 days after the close of each quarter of our taxable year we must also satisfy several tests relating to the nature and diversification of our assets determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles at least 75 of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets cash cash items including receivables arising in the ordinary course of our operation government securities and qualified temporary investments although the remaining 25 of our assets generally may be invested without restriction we are prohibited from owning securities representing more than 10 of either the vote the “10 vote 

test” or value the “10 value test” of the outstanding securities of any issuer other than a qualified reit subsidiary another reit or a taxable reit subsidiary further no more than 20 of the total assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries the “20 asset test” and no more than 5 of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities of any nongovernmental issuer other than a qualified reit subsidiary the “5 asset test” another reit or a taxable reit subsidiary each of the 10 vote test the 10 value test and the 20 and 5 asset tests must be satisfied at the end of each quarter there are special rules which provide relief if the value related tests are not satisfied due to changes in the value of the assets of a reit 

 

for taxable years beginning after december 31 2000 certain items are excluded from the 10 value test including 1 straight debt securities of an issuer including straight debt that provides certain contingent payments 2 any loan to an individual or an estate 3 any rental agreement described in section 467 of the internal revenue code other than with a “related person” 4 any obligation to pay rents from real property 5 certain securities issued by a state or any subdivision thereof the district of columbia a foreign government or any political subdivision thereof or the commonwealth of puerto rico 6 any security issued by a reit and 7 any other arrangement that as determined by the secretary of the treasury is excepted from the definition of security “excluded securities” special rules apply to straight debt securities issued by corporations and entities taxable as partnerships for federal income tax purposes if a reit or its taxable reit subsidiary holds 1 straight debt securities of a corporate or partnership issuer and 2 securities of such issuer that are not excluded securities and have an aggregate value greater than 1 of such issuer’s outstanding securities the straight debt securities will be included in the 10 value test 

 

for taxable years beginning after december 31 2000 a reit’s interest as a partner in a partnership is not treated as a security for purposes of applying the 10 value test to securities issued by the partnership further any debt instrument issued by a partnership will not be a security for purposes of applying the 10 value test 1 to the extent of the reit’s interest as a partner in the partnership and 2 if at least 75 of the partnership’s gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions would qualify for the 75 gross income test for taxable years beginning after october 22 2004 for purposes of the 10 value test a reit’s interest in a partnership’s assets is the reit’s proportionate interest in any securities issued by the partnership other than the excluded securities described in the preceding paragraph 

 

with respect to corrections of failures for which the requirements for corrections are satisfied after october 22 2004 regardless of whether such failures occurred in taxable years beginning on before or after such date as to violations of the 10 vote test the 10 value test or the 5 asset test a reit may avoid disqualification as a reit by disposing of sufficient assets to cure a violation that does not exceed the lesser of 1 of the reit’s assets at the end of the relevant quarter or 10000000 provided that the disposition occurs within six months following the last day of the quarter in which the reit first identified the assets for violations of any of the reit asset tests due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that exceed the thresholds described in the preceding sentence a reit can avoid disqualification as a reit after the close of a taxable quarter by taking certain steps including disposition of sufficient assets within the six month period described above to meet the applicable asset test paying a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets during the period of time that the assets were held as nonqualifying assets and filing a schedule with the internal revenue service that describes the nonqualifying assets 

 

investments in taxable reit subsidiaries for taxable years beginning after december 31 2000 reits may own more than 10 of the voting power and value of securities in taxable reit subsidiaries we and any taxable corporate entity in which we own an interest are allowed to jointly elect to treat such entity as a “taxable reit subsidiary” 

 

several of our subsidiaries have elected to be treated as a taxable reit subsidiary taxable reit subsidiaries are subject to full corporate level federal taxation on their earnings but are permitted to engage in certain types of activities that cannot be performed directly by reits without jeopardizing their reit status our taxable reit subsidiaries will attempt to minimize the amount of these taxes but there can be no assurance whether or the extent to which measures taken to minimize taxes will be successful to the extent our taxable reit subsidiaries are required to pay federal state or local taxes the cash available for distribution as dividends to us from our taxable reit subsidiaries will be reduced 

 

the amount of interest on relatedparty debt that a taxable reit subsidiary may deduct is limited further a 100 tax applies to any interest payments by a taxable reit subsidiary to its affiliated reit to the extent the interest rate is not commercially reasonable a taxable reit subsidiary is permitted to deduct interest payments to unrelated parties without any of these restrictions 

 

the internal revenue service may reallocate costs between a reit and its taxable reit subsidiary where there is a lack of arm’slength dealing between the parties any deductible expenses allocated away from a taxable reit subsidiary would increase its tax liability further any amount by which a reit understates its deductions and overstates those of its taxable reit subsidiary will subject to certain exceptions be subject to a 100 tax additional taxable reit subsidiary elections may be made in the future for additional entities in which we own an interest 

 

annual distribution requirements in order to avoid being taxed as a regular corporation we are required to make distributions other than capital gain distributions to our stockholders which qualify for the dividends paid deduction in an amount at least equal to 1 the sum of i 90 of our “reit taxable income” computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain and ii 90 of the aftertax net income if any from foreclosure property minus 2 a portion of certain items of noncash income these distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for that year and if paid on or before the first regular distribution payment after such declaration the amount distributed must not be preferential this means that every stockholder of the class of stock to which a distribution is made must be treated the same as every other stockholder of that class and no class of stock may be treated otherwise than in accordance with its dividend rights as a class to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our “reit taxable income” as adjusted we will be subject to tax on the undistributed amount at regular corporate tax rates finally as discussed above we may be subject to an excise tax if we fail to meet certain other distribution requirements we intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy these annual distribution requirements 

 

it is possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90 distribution requirement or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation due to among other things 1 timing differences between i the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses and ii the inclusion of income and deduction of expenses in arriving at our taxable income or 2 the payment of severance benefits that may not be deductible to us in the event that timing differences occur we may find it necessary to arrange for borrowings or if possible pay dividends in the form of taxable stock dividends in order to meet the distribution requirement 

 

under certain circumstances in the event of a deficiency determined by the internal revenue service we may be able to rectify a resulting failure to meet the distribution requirement for a year by paying “deficiency dividends” to stockholders in a later year which may be included in our deduction for distributions paid for the earlier year thus we may be able to avoid being taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency distributions however we will be required to pay applicable penalties and interest based upon the amount of any deduction taken for deficiency distributions 

 

failure to qualify as a reit 

 

if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates distributions to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify as a reit will not be deductible nor will any particular amount of distributions be required to be made in any year all distributions to stockholders will be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these distributions and subject to certain limitations will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporate stockholders unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions we also will be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to statutory relief failure to qualify for even one year could result in our need to incur indebtedness or liquidate investments in order to pay potentially significant resulting tax liabilities 

 

in addition to the relief described above under “— income tests” and ‘‘— asset tests” relief is available in the event that we violate a provision of the internal revenue code that would result in our failure to qualify as a reit if 1 the violation is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect 2 we pay a penalty of 50000 for each failure to satisfy the provision and 3 the violation does not include a violation described under “— income tests” or “— asset tests” above it is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions 

 

federal income taxation of holders of our stock 

 

treatment of taxable us stockholders the following summary applies to you only if you are a “us stockholder” a “us stockholder” is a stockholder of shares of stock who for united states federal income tax purposes is 

 

  

so long as we qualify for taxation as a reit distributions on shares of our stock made out of the current or accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these distributions and not designated as capital gain dividends will be includable as ordinary income for federal income tax purposes none of these distributions will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for us corporate stockholders 

 

generally for taxable years ending after may 6 2003 through december 31 2008 the maximum marginal rate of tax payable by individuals on dividends received from corporations that are subject to a corporate level of tax is 15 except in limited circumstances this tax rate will not apply to dividends paid to you by us on our shares because generally we are not subject to federal income tax on the portion of our reit taxable income or capital gains distributed to our stockholders the reduced maximum federal income tax rate will apply to that portion if any of dividends received by you with respect to our shares that are attributable to 1 dividends received by us from nonreit corporations or other taxable reit subsidiaries 2 income from the prior year with respect to which we were required to pay federal corporate income tax during the prior year if for example we did not distribute 100 of our reit taxable income for the prior year or 3 the amount of any earnings and profits that were distributed by us and accumulated in a nonreit year 

 

distributions that are designated as capital gain dividends will be taxed as longterm capital gains to the extent they do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year without regard to the period for which you held our stock however if you are a corporation you may be required to treat a portion of some capital gain dividends as ordinary income 

 

if we elect to retain and pay income tax on any net longterm capital gain you would include in income as longterm capital gain your proportionate share of this net longterm capital gain you would also receive a refundable tax credit for your proportionate share of the tax paid by us on such retained capital gains and you would have an increase in the basis of your shares of our stock in an amount equal to your includable capital gains less your share of the tax deemed paid 

 

you may not include in your federal income tax return any of our net operating losses or capital losses federal income tax rules may also require that certain minimum tax adjustments and preferences be apportioned to you in addition any distribution declared by us in october november or december of any year on a specified date in any such month shall be treated as both paid by us and received by you on december 31 of that year provided that the distribution is actually paid by us no later than january 31 of the following year 

 

we will be treated as having sufficient earnings and profits to treat as a dividend any distribution up to the amount required to be distributed in order to avoid imposition of the 4 excise tax discussed under “— general” and “— qualification as a reit — annual distribution requirements” above as a result you may be required to treat as taxable dividends certain distributions that would otherwise result in a taxfree return of capital moreover any “deficiency dividend” will be treated as a dividend an ordinary dividend or a capital gain dividend as the case may be regardless of our earnings and profits any other distributions in excess of current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to you to the extent these distributions do not exceed the adjusted tax basis of your shares of our stock you will be required to reduce the tax basis of your shares of our stock by the amount of these distributions until the basis has been reduced to zero after which these distributions will be taxable as capital gain if the shares of our stock are held as a capital asset the tax basis as so reduced will be used in computing the capital gain or loss if any realized upon sale of the shares of our stock any loss upon a sale or exchange of shares of our stock which were held for six months or less after application of certain holding period rules will generally be treated as a longterm capital loss to the extent you previously received capital gain distributions with respect to these shares of our stock 

 

upon the sale or exchange of any shares of our stock to or with a person other than us or a sale or exchange of all shares of our stock whether actually or constructively owned with us you will generally recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your adjusted tax basis in these shares of our stock this gain will be capital gain if you held these shares of our stock as a capital asset 

 

if we redeem any of your shares in us the treatment can only be determined on the basis of particular facts at the time of redemption in general you will recognize gain or loss as opposed to dividend income equal to the difference between the amount received by you in the redemption and your adjusted tax basis in your shares redeemed if such redemption results in a “complete termination” of your interest in all classes of our equity securities is a “substantially disproportionate redemption” or is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” with respect to you in applying these tests there must be taken into account your ownership of all classes of our equity securities eg common stock preferred stock depositary shares and warrants you also must take into account any equity securities that are considered to be constructively owned by you 

 

if as a result of a redemption by us of your shares you no longer own either actually or constructively any of our equity securities or only own actually and constructively an insubstantial percentage of our equity securities then it is probable that the redemption of your shares would be considered “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” and thus would result in gain or loss to you however whether a distribution is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” depends on all of the facts and circumstances and if you rely on any of these tests at the time of redemption you should consult your tax advisor to determine their application to the particular situation 

 

generally if the redemption does not meet the tests described above then the proceeds received by you from the redemption of your shares will be treated as a distribution taxable as a dividend to the extent of the allocable portion of current or accumulated earnings and profits if the redemption is taxed as a dividend your adjusted tax basis in the redeemed shares will be transferred to any other shareholdings in us that you own if you own no other shareholdings in us under certain circumstances such basis may be transferred to a related person or it may be lost entirely 

 

gain from the sale or exchange of our shares held for more than one year is taxed at a maximum longterm capital gain rate which is currently 15 pursuant to internal revenue service guidance we may classify portions of our capital gain dividends as gains eligible for the longterm capital gains rate or as gain taxable to individual stockholders at a maximum rate of 25 

 

treatment of taxexempt us stockholders taxexempt entities including qualified employee pension and profit sharing trusts and individual retirement accounts “exempt organizations” generally are exempt from federal income taxation however they are subject to taxation on their unrelated business taxable income “ubti” the internal revenue service has issued a published revenue ruling that dividend distributions from a reit to an exempt employee pension trust do not constitute ubti provided that the shares of the reit are not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business of the exempt employee pension trust based on this ruling amounts distributed by us to exempt organizations generally should not constitute ubti however if an exempt organization finances its acquisition of the shares of our stock with debt a portion of its income from us will constitute ubti pursuant to the 

“debt financed property” rules likewise a portion of the exempt organization’s income from us would constitute ubti if we held a residual interest in a real estate mortgage investment conduit 

 

in addition in certain circumstances a pension trust that owns more than 10 of our stock is required to treat a percentage of our dividends as ubti this rule applies to a pension trust holding more than 10 of our stock only if 1 the percentage of our income that is ubti determined as if we were a pension trust is at least 5 2 we qualify as a reit by reason of the modification of the five or fewer requirement that allows beneficiaries of the pension trust to be treated as holding shares in proportion to their actuarial interests in the pension trust and 3 either i one pension trust owns more than 25 of the value of our stock or ii a group of pension trusts individually holding more than 10 of the value of our stock collectively own more than 50 of the value of our stock 

 

backup withholding and information reporting under certain circumstances you may be subject to backup withholding at applicable rates on payments made with respect to or cash proceeds of a sale or exchange of shares of our stock backup withholding will apply only if you 1 fail to provide a correct taxpayer identification number which if you are an individual is ordinarily your social security number 2 furnish an incorrect taxpayer identification number 3 are notified by the internal revenue service that you have failed to properly report payments of interest or dividends or 4 fail to certify under penalties of perjury that you have furnished a correct taxpayer identification number and that the internal revenue service has not notified you that you are subject to backup withholding 

 

backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients such as corporations and taxexempt organizations you should consult with a tax advisor regarding qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining an exemption backup withholding is not an additional tax rather the amount of any backup withholding with respect to payment to a stockholder will be allowed as a credit against such stockholder’s united states federal income tax liability and may entitle such stockholder to a refund provided that the required information is provided to the internal revenue service in addition withholding a portion of capital gain distributions made to stockholders may be required for stockholders who fail to certify their nonforeign status 

 

taxation of foreign stockholders the following summary applies to you only if you are a foreign person the federal taxation of foreign persons is a highly complex matter that may be affected by many considerations 

 

except as discussed below distributions to you of cash generated by our real estate operations in the form of ordinary dividends but not by the sale or exchange of our capital assets generally will be subject to us withholding tax at a rate of 30 unless an applicable tax treaty reduces that tax and you file with us the required form evidencing the lower rate 

 

in general you will be subject to united states federal income tax on a graduated rate basis rather than withholding with respect to your investment in our stock if such investment is “effectively connected” with your conduct of a trade or business in the united states a corporate foreign stockholder that receives income that is or is treated as effectively connected with a united states trade or business may also be subject to the branch profits tax which is payable in addition to regular united states corporate income tax the following discussion will apply to foreign stockholders whose investment in us is not so effectively connected we expect to withhold united states income tax as described below on the gross amount of any distributions paid to you unless 1 you file an internal revenue service form w8eci with us claiming that the distribution is “effectively connected” or 2 certain other exceptions apply 

 

distributions by us that are attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a united states real property interest will be taxed to you under the foreign investment in real property tax act of 1980 “firpta” as if these distributions were gains “effectively connected” with a united states trade or business accordingly you will be taxed at the normal capital gain rates applicable to a us stockholder on these amounts subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals distributions subject to firpta may also be subject to a branch profits tax in the hands of a corporate foreign stockholder that is not entitled to treaty exemption 

 

we will be required to withhold from distributions subject to firpta and remit to the internal revenue service 35 of designated capital gain dividends or if greater 35 of the amount of any distributions that could be designated as capital gain dividends in addition if we designate prior distributions as capital gain dividends subsequent distributions up to the amount of the prior distributions not withheld against will be treated as capital gain dividends for purposes of withholding 

 

for taxable years beginning after october 22 2004 any capital gain dividend with respect to any class of stock that is “regularly traded” on an established securities market will be treated as an ordinary dividend if the foreign stockholder did not own more than 5 of such class of stock at any time during the taxable year once this provision takes effect foreign stockholders generally will not be required to report distributions received from us on us federal income tax returns and all distributions treated as dividends for us federal income tax purposes including any capital gain dividend will be subject to a 30 us withholding tax unless reduced under an applicable income tax treaty as discussed above in addition the branch profits tax will no longer apply to such distributions 

 

unless our shares constitute a “united states real property interest” within the meaning of firpta or are effectively connected with a us trade or business a sale of our shares by you generally will not be subject to united states taxation our shares will not constitute a united states real property interest if we qualify as a “domestically controlled reit” we do and expect to continue to qualify as a domestically controlled reit a domestically controlled reit is a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50 in value of its shares is held directly or indirectly by foreign stockholders however if you are a nonresident alien individual who is present in the united states for 183 days or more during the taxable year and certain other conditions apply you will be subject to a 30 tax on such capital gains in any event a purchaser of our shares from you will not be required under firpta to withhold on the purchase price if the purchased shares are “regularly traded” on an established securities market or if we are a domestically controlled reit otherwise under firpta the purchaser may be required to withhold 10 of the purchase price and remit such amount to the internal revenue service 

 

backup withholding tax and information reporting will generally not apply to distributions paid to you outside the united states that are treated as 1 dividends to which the 30 or lower treaty rate withholding tax discussed above applies 2 capital gains dividends or 3 distributions attributable to gain from the sale or exchange by us of us real property interests payment of the proceeds of a sale of stock within the united states or conducted through certain us related financial intermediaries is subject to both backup withholding and information reporting unless the beneficial owner certifies under penalties of perjury that he or she is not a us person and the payor does not have actual knowledge that the beneficial owner is a us person or otherwise established an exemption you may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for refund with the internal revenue service

forwardlooking statements and risk factors 

 

this annual report on form 10k and the documents incorporated by reference contain statements that constitute “forwardlooking statements” as that term is defined in the federal securities laws these forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to those regarding 

 

  

when we use words such as “may” “will” “intend” “should” “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “estimate” or similar expressions we are making forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of 

future performance and involve risks and uncertainties our expected results may not be achieved and actual results may differ materially from our expectations this may be a result of various factors including but not limited to 

 

  

risk factors related to our operators’ revenues and expenses 

 

our investment property operators’ revenues are primarily driven by occupancy medicare and medicaid reimbursement if applicable and private pay rates expenses for these facilities are primarily driven by the costs of labor food utilities taxes insurance and rent or debt service revenues from government reimbursement have and may continue to come under pressure due to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls liability insurance and staffing costs continue to increase for our operators to the extent that any decrease in revenues andor any increase in operating expenses result in a property not generating enough cash to make payments to us the credit of our operator and the value of other collateral would have to be relied upon 

 

risk factors related to obligor bankruptcies 

 

we are exposed to the risk that our obligors may not be able to meet the rent principal and interest or other payments due us which may result in an obligor bankruptcy or insolvency or that an obligor might become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings for other reasons although our operating lease agreements provide us with the right to evict a tenant demand immediate payment of rent and exercise other remedies and our loans 

provide us with the right to terminate any funding obligation demand immediate repayment of principal and unpaid interest foreclose on the collateral and exercise other remedies the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization an obligor in bankruptcy or subject to insolvency proceedings may be able to limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent in the case of a lease or to receive unpaid principal and interest in the case of a loan and to exercise other rights and remedies 

 

we may be required to fund certain expenses eg real estate taxes and maintenance to preserve the value of an investment property avoid the imposition of liens on a property andor transition a property to a new tenant in some instances we have terminated our lease with a tenant and relet the property to another tenant in some of those situations we have provided working capital loans to and limited indemnification of the new obligor if we cannot transition a leased property to a new tenant we may take possession of that property which may expose us to certain successor liabilities should such events occur our revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely affected 

 

transfers of health care facilities may require regulatory approvals and these facilities may not have efficient alternative uses 

 

transfers of health care facilities to successor operators may be subject to regulatory approvals that are not required for transfers of other types of real estate the replacement of an operator could be delayed by the approval process of any federal state or local agency necessary for the transfer of the facility or the replacement of the operator licensed to manage the facility alternatively given the specialized nature of our facilities we may be required to spend substantial time and funds to adapt these properties to other uses if we are unable to timely transfer properties to successor operators or find efficient alternative uses our revenue and operations may be adversely affected 

 

risk factors related to government regulations 

 

our obligors’ businesses are affected by government reimbursement and private payor rates to the extent that an operatortenant receives a significant portion of its revenues from governmental payors primarily medicare and medicaid such revenues may be subject to statutory and regulatory changes retroactive rate adjustments recovery of program overpayments or setoffs administrative rulings policy interpretations payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries government funding restrictions at a program level or with respect to specific facilities and interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing governmental investigations and audits at such property in recent years governmental payors have frozen or reduced payments to health care providers due to budgetary pressures health care reimbursement will likely continue to be of paramount importance to federal and state authorities we cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or effect any future legislative reforms may have on the financial condition of our obligors and properties there can be no assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will continue to be available for services provided by any property operator whether the property receives reimbursement from medicare medicaid or private payors significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on an obligor’s liquidity financial condition and results of operations which could adversely affect the ability of an obligor to meet its obligations to us see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — reimbursement” above 

 

our operators and tenants generally are subject to extensive federal state and local licensure certification and inspection laws and regulations our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with any of these laws could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension or decertification from federal and state health care programs loss of license or closure of the facility such actions may have an effect on our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make lease payments to us and therefore adversely impact us 

 

many of our medical properties may require a license andor certificate of need to operate failure to obtain a license or certificate of need or loss of a required license or certificate of need would prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by the operators or tenants these events could materially adversely affect our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make rent payments to us state and local laws also may regulate expansion including the addition of new beds or services or acquisition of medical equipment and the construction of health care facilities by requiring a certificate of need or other similar approval 

 

risk factors related to liability claims and insurance costs 

 

longterm care property operators skilled nursing facilities assisted living facilities and independent livingcontinuing care retirement communities have experienced substantial increases in both the number and size of patient care liability claims in recent years particularly in the states of texas and florida as a result general and professional liability costs have increased and may continue to increase longterm care liability insurance rates are increasing nationwide because of large jury awards over the past four years both texas and florida have adopted skilled nursing property liability laws that modify or limit tort damages despite some of these reforms the longterm care industry overall continues to experience very high general and professional liability costs insurance companies have responded to this claims crisis by severely restricting their capacity to write longterm care general and professional liability policies no assurances can be given that the climate for longterm care general and professional liability insurance will improve in any of the foregoing states or any other states where the property operators conduct business insurance companies may continue to reduce or stop writing general and professional liability policies for longterm care facilities thus general and professional liability insurance coverage may be restricted or very costly which may adversely affect the property operators’ future operations cash flows and financial condition and may have a material adverse effect on the property operators’ ability to meet their obligations to us 

 

risk factors related to acquisitions 

 

we are exposed to the risk that our future acquisitions may not prove to be successful we could encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired properties including contingent liabilities and newly acquired properties might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business if we agree to provide construction funding to an operatortenant and the project is not completed we may need to take steps to ensure completion of the project moreover if we issue equity securities or incur additional debt or both to finance future acquisitions it may reduce our per share financial results these costs may negatively affect our results of operations 

 

risk factors related to environmental laws 

 

under various federal and state laws owners or operators of real estate may be required to respond to the presence or release of hazardous substances on the property and may be held liable for property damage personal injuries or penalties that result from environmental contamination or exposure to hazardous substances we may become liable to reimburse the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination generally such liability attaches to a person based on the person’s relationship to the property our tenants or borrowers are primarily responsible for the condition of the property moreover we review environmental site assessments of the properties that we own or encumber prior to taking an interest in them those assessments are designed to meet the “all appropriate inquiry” standard which we believe qualifies us for the innocent purchaser defense if environmental liabilities arise based upon such assessments we do not believe that any of our properties are subject to material environmental contamination however environmental liabilities may be present in our properties and we may incur costs to remediate contamination which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition or the business or financial condition of our obligors 

 

risk factors related to facilities that require entrance fees 

 

certain of our senior housing facilities require the payment of an upfront entrance fee by the resident a portion of which may be refundable by the operator some of these facilities are subject to substantial oversight by state regulators as a result of this oversight residents of these facilities may have a variety of rights including for example the right to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time and certain lien rights the oversight and rights of residents within these facilities may have an effect on the revenue or operations of the operators of such facilities and therefore may negatively impact us 

 

risk factors related to facilities under construction or development 

 

at any given time we may be in the process of constructing one or more new facilities that ultimately will require a license before they can be utilized by the operator for their intended use the operator also will need to obtain medicare and medicaid provider agreements or third party payor contracts in the event that the operator is unable to obtain the necessary licensure provider agreements on contracts after the completion of construction there is a risk that we will not be able to earn any revenues on the facility until either the initial operator obtains a license to operate the new facility and the necessary provider agreements or contracts or we can find and contract with a new operator that is able to obtain a license to operate the facility for its intended use and the necessary provider agreements or contracts 

 

in connection with our renovation redevelopment development and related construction activities we may be unable to obtain or suffer delays in obtaining necessary zoning landuse building occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations these factors could result in increased costs or our abandonment of these projects in addition we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms which may render us unable to proceed with our development activities and we may not be able to complete construction and leaseup of a property on schedule which could result in increased debt service expense or construction costs 

 

additionally the time frame required for development construction and leaseup of these properties means that we may have to wait years for significant cash returns because we are required to make cash distributions to our stockholders if the cash flow from operations or refinancing is not sufficient we may be forced to borrow additional money to fund such distributions newly developed and acquired properties may not produce the cash flow that we expect which could adversely affect our overall financial performance 

 

in deciding whether to acquire or develop a particular property we make assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property in particular we estimate the return on our investment based on expected occupancy and rental rates if our financial projections with respect to a new property are inaccurate and the property is unable to achieve the expected occupancy and rental rates it may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment our estimate of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove to be inaccurate which may result in our failure to meet our profitability goals additionally we may acquire new properties not fully leased and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with that property 

 

we do not know if our tenants will renew their existing leases and if they do not we may be unable to lease the properties on as favorable terms or at all 

 

we cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases at the end of their lease terms which expire at various times through 2021 if these leases are not renewed we would be required to find other tenants to occupy those properties there can be no assurance that we would be able to identify suitable replacement tenants or enter into leases with new tenants on terms as favorable to us as the current leases or that we would be able to lease those properties at all 

 

our ownership of properties through ground leases exposes us to the loss of such properties upon breach or termination of the ground leases 

 

we have acquired an interest in certain of our properties by acquiring a leasehold interest in the property on which the building is located and we may acquire additional properties in the future through the purchase of interests in ground leases as the lessee under a ground lease we are exposed to the possibility of losing the property upon termination of the ground lease or an earlier breach of the ground lease by us 

 

illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties 

 

real estate investments are relatively illiquid our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in economic and other conditions will be limited no assurances can be given that we will recognize full value for any property that we are required to sell for liquidity reasons our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 

risk factors related to reinvestment of sale proceeds 

 

from time to time we will have cash available from 1 the proceeds of sales of our securities 2 principal payments on our loans receivable and 3 the sale of properties including nonelective dispositions under the terms of master leases or similar financial support arrangements we must reinvest these proceeds on a timely basis in properties or in qualified shortterm investments we compete for real estate investments with a broad variety of potential investors this competition for attractive investments may negatively affect our ability to make timely investments on terms acceptable to us delays in acquiring properties may negatively impact revenues and perhaps our ability to make distributions to stockholders 

 

failure to properly manage our rapid growth could distract our management or increase our expenses 

 

we have experienced rapid growth and development in a relatively short period of time and expect to continue this rapid growth in the future our rapid growth has resulted in increased levels of responsibility for our management future property acquisitions could place significant additional demands on and require us to expand our management resources and personnel our failure to manage any such rapid growth effectively could harm our business and in particular our financial condition results of operations and cash flows which could negatively affect our ability to make distributions to stockholders our rapid growth could also increase our capital requirements which may require us to issue potentially dilutive equity securities and incur additional debt 

 

other risk factors 

 

we are also subject to a number of other risks first we might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a reit we intend to operate as a reit under the internal revenue code and believe we have and will continue to operate in such a manner since reit qualification requires us to meet a number of complex requirements it is possible that we may fail to fulfill them and if we do our earnings will be reduced by the amount of federal taxes owed a reduction in our earnings would affect the amount we could distribute to our stockholders also if we were not a reit we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders since a nonreit is not required to pay dividends to stockholders amounting to at least the sum of 1 85 of our reit ordinary income for such year other than capital gain that we elect to retain and pay tax on and 2 any undistributed taxable income from preceding periods see “item 1 — business — taxation” for a discussion of the provisions of the internal revenue code that apply to us and the effects of nonqualification 

 

second our second restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain antitakeover provisions staggered board provisions restrictions on share ownership and transfer and super majority stockholder approval requirements for business combinations that could make it more difficult for or even prevent a third party from acquiring us without the approval of our incumbent board of directors provisions and agreements that inhibit or discourage takeover attempts could reduce the market value of our common stock 

 

third we are dependent on key personnel although we have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers losing any one of them could at least temporarily have an adverse impact on our operations we believe that losing more than one would have a material adverse impact on our business

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

the following discussion and analysis is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of health care reit inc for the periods presented and should be read together with the notes thereto contained in this annual report on form 10k other important factors are identified in “item 1 — business” and “item 1a — risk factors” above 

 

executive overview 

 

business 

 

health care reit inc is a selfadministered equity real estate investment trust that invests in the full spectrum of senior housing and health care real estate founded in 1970 we were the first reit to invest exclusively in health care properties the following table summarizes our portfolio as of december 31 2006 

 

 

 

 

  

our primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and enhance stockholder value we seek to pay consistent cash dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual increases in rental and interest income and portfolio growth to meet these objectives we invest across the full spectrum of senior housing and health care real estate and diversify our investment portfolio by property type operatortenant and geographic location 

 

substantially all of our revenues and sources of cash flows from operations are derived from operating lease rentals and interest earned on outstanding loans receivable these items represent our primary source of liquidity to fund distributions and are dependent upon our obligors’ continued ability to make contractual rent and interest payments to us to the extent that our obligors experience operating difficulties and are unable to generate sufficient cash to make payments to us there could be a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity andor financial condition to mitigate this risk we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property and operatortenant our asset management process includes review of monthly financial statements for each property periodic review of obligor credit periodic property inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure real estate taxes letters of credit and other collateral in monitoring our portfolio our personnel use a proprietary database to collect and analyze propertyspecific data additionally we conduct extensive research to ascertain industry trends and risks through these asset management and research efforts we are typically able to intervene at an early stage to address payment risk and in so doing support both the collectibility of revenue and the value of our investment 

 

in addition to our asset management and research efforts we also structure our investments to help mitigate payment risk we typically limit our investments to no more than 90 of the appraised value of a property 

operating leases and loans are normally credit enhanced by guaranties andor letters of credit in addition operating leases are typically structured as master leases and loans are generally crossdefaulted and crosscollateralized with other loans operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its affiliates 

 

for the year ended december 31 2006 rental income and interest income represented 93 and 6 respectively of total gross revenues including discontinued operations substantially all of our operating leases are designed with either fixed or contingent escalating rent structures leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straightline basis over the initial lease period subject to a collectibility assessment rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period our yield on loans receivable depends upon a number of factors including the stated interest rate the average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments 

 

depending upon the availability and cost of external capital we anticipate investing in additional properties new investments are generally funded from temporary borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements internally generated cash and the proceeds from sales of real property our investments generate internal cash from rent and interest receipts and principal payments on loans receivable permanent financing for future investments which replaces funds drawn under the unsecured lines of credit arrangements is expected to be provided through a combination of public and private offerings of debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt we believe our liquidity and various sources of available capital are sufficient to fund operations meet debt service obligations both principal and interest make dividend distributions and finance future investments 

 

depending upon market conditions we believe that new investments will be available in the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to our stockholders we expect to complete gross new investments of 1000000000 to 1200000000 in 2007 including acquisitions of 700000000 to 800000000 and funded new development of 300000000 to 400000000 we anticipate the sale of real property and the repayment of loans receivable totaling approximately 100000000 to 200000000 during 2007 it is possible that additional loan repayments or sales of real property may occur in the future to the extent that loan repayments and real property sales exceed new investments our revenues and cash flows from operations could be adversely affected we expect to reinvest the proceeds from any loan repayments and real property sales in new investments to the extent that new investment requirements exceed our available cash onhand we expect to borrow under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements at december 31 2006 we had 36216000 of cash and cash equivalents and 515000000 of available borrowing capacity under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements our investment activity may exceed our borrowing capacity under our unsecured lines of credit to the extent that we are unable to issue equity or debt securities to provide additional capital we may not be able to fund all of our potential investments which could have an adverse effect on our revenues and cash flows from operations 

 

key transactions in 2006 

 

we completed the following key transactions during the year ended december 31 2006

key performance indicators trends and uncertainties 

 

we utilize several key performance indicators to evaluate the various aspects of our business these indicators are discussed below and relate to operating performance credit strength and concentration risk management uses these key performance indicators to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results in making operating decisions and for budget planning purposes 

 

operating performance we believe that net income available to common stockholders “nics” is the most appropriate earnings measure other useful supplemental measures of our operating performance include funds from operations “ffo” and funds available for distribution “fad” however these supplemental measures are not defined by us generally accepted accounting principals “us gaap” please refer to the section entitled “nongaap financial measures” for further discussion of ffo and fad and for reconciliations of ffo and fad to nics these earning measures and their relative per share amounts are widely used by investors and analysts in the valuation comparison and investment recommendations of reits the following table reflects the recent historical trends of our operating performance measures in thousands except per share data 

 

 

 

credit strength we measure our credit strength both in terms of leverage ratios and coverage ratios our leverage ratios include debt to book capitalization debt to gross assets and debt to market capitalization the leverage ratios indicate how much of our balance sheet capitalization is related to longterm debt our coverage ratios include interest coverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio the coverage ratios indicate our ability to service interest and fixed charges interest plus preferred dividends and secured debt principal amortizations we expect to maintain capitalization ratios and coverage ratios sufficient to maintain investment grade ratings with moody’s investors service standard  poor’s ratings services and fitch ratings the coverage ratios are based on earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” which is discussed in further detail and reconciled to net income below in “nongaap financial measures” leverage ratios and coverage ratios are 

widely used by investors analysts and rating agencies in the valuation comparison investment recommendations and rating of companies the following table reflects the recent historical trends for our credit strength measures 

 

 

 

concentration risk we evaluate our concentration risk in terms of asset mix investment mix customer mix and geographic mix concentration risk is a valuable measure in understanding what portion of our investments could be at risk if certain sectors were to experience downturns asset mix measures the portion of our investments that are real property in order to qualify as an equity reit at least 75 of our real estate investments must be real property whereby each property which includes the land buildings improvements intangibles and related rights is owned by us and leased to an operator pursuant to a longterm operating lease investment mix measures the portion of our investments that relate to our various property types customer mix measures the portion of our investments that relate to our top five customers the following table reflects our recent historical trends of concentration risk 

 

 

 

  

we evaluate our key performance indicators in conjunction with current expectations to determine if historical trends are indicative of future results our expected results may not be achieved and actual results may differ materially from our expectations management regularly monitors various economic and other factors to develop strategic and tactical plans designed to improve performance and maximize our competitive position our ability to achieve our financial objectives is dependent upon our ability to effectively execute these plans and to appropriately respond to emerging economic and companyspecific trends please refer to “item 1a — risk factors” above for further discussion

operating activities the increases in net cash provided from operating activities are primarily attributable to increases in net income excluding depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation and net straightline rental income net income and the provisions for depreciation and amortization increased primarily as a result of net new investments in properties owned by us see the discussion of investing activities below for additional details to the extent that we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future our net income and provisions for depreciation and amortization will change accordingly 

 

the following is a summary of our straightline rent dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

gross straightline rental income represents the noncash difference between contractual cash rent due and the average rent recognized pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 13 accounting for leases “sfas 13” for leases with fixed rental escalators net of collectibility reserves if any this amount is positive in the first half of a lease term but declining every year due to annual increases in cash rent due and is negative in the second half of a lease term the decrease in gross straightline rental income is primarily due to annual increases in cash rent due on leases with fixed increases the increase in nonrecurring cash receipts is primarily attributable to cash received upon renegotiation of a lease in connection to the acquisition of commonwealth communities holdings llc by kindred healthcare inc in february 2006 

investing activities the changes in net cash used in investing activities are primarily attributable to the windrose merger and net changes in loans receivable and real property investments the following is a summary of our investment and disposition activities excluding the windrose merger dollars in thousands

capital structure 

 

as of december 31 2006 we had stockholders’ equity of 1978793000 and a total outstanding debt balance of 2198001000 which represents a debt to total book capitalization ratio of 53 our ratio of debt to market capitalization was 39 at december 31 2006 for the year ended december 31 2006 our coverage ratio of ebitda to interest was 297 to 100 for the year ended december 31 2006 our coverage ratio of ebitda to fixed charges was 239 to 100 also at december 31 2006 we had 36216000 of cash and cash equivalents and 515000000 of available borrowing capacity under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements 

 

our debt agreements contain various covenants restrictions and events of default among other things these provisions require us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness create liens and make investments or acquisitions as of december 31 2006 we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our debt agreements none of our debt agreements contain provisions for acceleration that could be triggered by our debt ratings however under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements the ratings on our senior unsecured notes are used to determine the fees and interest payable 

 

our senior unsecured notes are rated baa3 ratings watch positive bbb stable and bbb positive by moody’s investors service standard  poor’s ratings services and fitch ratings respectively we plan to manage the company to maintain investment grade status with a commensurate capital structure consistent with our current profile any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the noted rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity andor financial condition

the following is a summary of certain items that impact the results of operations for the year ended december 31 2005 

 

  

the following is a summary of certain items that impact the results of operations for the year ended december 31 2004 

 

  

the increase in fully diluted average common shares outstanding is primarily the result of the windrose merger public and private common stock offerings and common stock issuances pursuant to our drip the following table represents the changes in outstanding common stock for the period from january 1 2004 to december 31 2006 in thousands 

 

 

revenues were comprised of the following dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

the increase in gross revenues is primarily attributable to increased rental income resulting from the acquisitions of new properties from which we receive rent see the discussion of investing activities in “liquidity and capital resources” above for further information certain of our leases contain annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the consumer price index andor changes in the gross operating revenues of the tenant’s properties these escalators are not fixed so no straightline rent is recorded however rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period while this change does not affect our cash flow or our ability to pay dividends it is anticipated that we will generate additional organic growth and minimize noncash straightline rent over time if gross operating revenues at our facilities andor the consumer price index do not increase a portion of our revenues may not continue to increase sales of real property would offset revenue increases and to the extent that they exceed new acquisitions could result in decreased revenues our leases could renew above or below current rent rates resulting in an increase or decrease in rental income 

 

interest income decreased in 2006 primarily due to recognition of additional interest income of approximately 4523000 in 2005 the additional interest income related to the payoffs of loans that were either on nonaccrual or partial accrual and all contractual interest was received from the borrowers the decrease from 2004 to 2006 is primarily due to the decrease in outstanding loans receivable from 258734000 at december 31 2003 to 194448000 at december 31 2006 

 

expenses were comprised of the following dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

the increase in total expenses is primarily attributable to increases in interest expense and the provisions for depreciation and amortization offset by the recognition of losses on extinguishment of debt in 2005 the increases in interest expense are primarily due to higher average borrowings and changes in the amount of capitalized interest offsetting interest expense if we borrow under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements issue additional senior unsecured notes or assume additional secured debt our interest expense will increase 

 

the following is a summary of our interest expense dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

the change in interest expense on senior unsecured notes is due to the net effect and timing of issuances and extinguishments see the discussion of financing activities in “liquidity and capital resources” above for further information 

 

the following is a summary of our senior unsecured notes activity dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

the change in interest expense on secured debt is due to the net effect and timing of assumptions extinguishments and principal amortizations the following is a summary of our secured debt activity dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

the change in interest expense on unsecured lines of credit arrangements is due primarily to higher average interest rates the following is a summary of our unsecured lines of credit arrangements dollars in thousands 

 

 

we capitalize certain interest costs associated with funds used to finance the construction of properties owned directly by us the amount capitalized is based upon the borrowings outstanding during the construction period using the rate of interest that approximates our cost of financing our interest expense is reduced by the amount capitalized capitalized interest for the years ended december 31 2004 2005 and 2006 totaled 875000 665000 and 4470000 respectively 

 

on may 6 2004 we entered into two interest rate swap agreements the “swaps” for a total notional amount of 100000000 to hedge changes in fair value attributable to changes in the libor swap rate of 100000000 of fixed rate debt with a maturity date of november 15 2013 we receive a fixed rate of 60 and pay a variable rate based on sixmonth libor plus a spread for the year ended december 31 2006 we incurred 197000 of losses related to our swaps that was recorded as an addition to interest expense for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 we generated 972000 and 1770000 respectively of savings related to our swaps that was recorded as a reduction of interest expense 

 

property operating expenses represent 12 days of expenses in 2006 related to windrose’s operating properties acquired on december 20 2006 these expenses include ground leases property taxes and other expenses not reimbursed by tenants 

 

depreciation and amortization increased primarily as a result of additional investments in properties owned directly by us see the discussion of investing activities in “liquidity and capital resources” above for further information to the extent that we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future our provision for depreciation will change accordingly 

 

general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues including discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2006 were 827 as compared with 589 and 654 for the same periods in 2005 and 2004 respectively the 2006 increase is directly attributable to 5213000 of merger related expenses and 1287000 of accelerated stockbased compensation expenses the change from 2004 to 2005 is due to increased costs to attract and retain appropriate personnel to achieve our business objectives offset by a decrease in professional service fees and other operating costs as a result of focused expense control 

 

the change in loan expense was primarily due to increased costs in 2006 related to amending our primary unsecured line of credit arrangement and costs related to the issuance of senior unsecured notes 

 

during the year ended december 31 2004 it was determined that the projected undiscounted cash flows from one of our properties did not exceed its related net book value and an impairment charge of 314000 was recorded to reduce the property to its estimated fair market value the estimated fair market value of the property was determined by an independent appraisal we did not record any impairment charges for the years ended december 31 2005 or december 31 2006 

 

the provision for loan losses is related to our critical accounting estimate for the allowance for loan losses and is discussed below in “critical accounting policies” 

 

other items were comprised of the following dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

three assisted living facilities were held for sale at december 31 2006 and were sold subsequent to yearend during the years ended december 31 2004 2005 and 2006 we sold properties with carrying values of 37710000 88098000 and 75989000 for net losses of 143000 and net gains of 3227000 and 1267000 respectively 

in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 144 we have reclassified the income and expenses attributable to the properties sold subsequent to january 1 2002 and attributable to assets held for sale at december 31 2006 to discontinued operations these properties generated 3306000 and 1213000 of income after deducting depreciation and interest expense from rental revenue for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2005 respectively and a loss of 2021000 for the year ended december 31 2006 please refer to note 16 of our audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

 

the increase in preferred dividends is primarily due to the increase in average outstanding preferred shares the following is a summary of our preferred stock activity 

 

 

 

in conjunction with the acquisition of windrose medical properties trust in december 2006 we issued 2100000 shares of 75 series g cumulative convertible preferred stock these shares have a liquidation value of 2500 per share dividends are payable quarterly in arrears the preferred stock which has no stated maturity may be redeemed by us at a redemption price of 2500 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends on such shares to the redemption date on or after june 30 2010 each series g preferred share is convertible by the holder into our common stock at a conversion price of 3493 equivalent to a conversion rate of 07157 common shares per series g preferred share these shares were recorded at 2958 per share which was deemed to be the fair value at the date of issuance 

 

nongaap financial measures 

 

we believe that net income available to common stockholders as defined by us gaap is the most appropriate earnings measurement however we consider ffo and fad to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with us gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation however since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient in response the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” created ffo as a supplemental measure of operating performance for reits that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income ffo as defined by nareit means net income computed in accordance with us gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures fad represents ffo excluding the net straightline rental adjustments rental income related to abovebelow market leases and amortization of deferred loan expenses and less cash used to fund capital expenditures tenant improvements and lease commissions 

 

in april 2002 the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 145 that requires gains and losses on extinguishment of debt to be classified as income or loss from continuing operations rather than as extraordinary items as previously required under statement no 4 we adopted the standard effective january 1 2003 and have properly reflected the 21484000 or 039 per diluted share of losses on extinguishment of debt for the year ended december 31 2005 these charges have not been added back for the calculations of ffo fad or ebitda 

 

in october 2003 nareit informed its member companies that the sec had changed its position on certain aspects of the nareit ffo definition including impairment charges previously the sec accepted nareit’s view that impairment charges were effectively an early recognition of an expected loss on an impending sale of 

property and thus should be added back to net income in the calculation of ffo and fad similar to other gains and losses on sales however the sec’s clarified interpretation is that recurring impairments taken on real property may not be added back to net income in the calculation of ffo and fad we have adopted this interpretation and have not added back impairment charges of 314000 or 001 per diluted share recorded for the year ended december 31 2004 

 

ebitda stands for earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization we believe that ebitda along with net income and cash flow provided from operating activities is an important supplemental measure because it provides additional information to assess and evaluate the performance of our operations additionally restrictive covenants in our longterm debt arrangements contain financial ratios based on ebitda we primarily utilize ebitda to measure our interest coverage ratio which represents ebitda divided by total interest and our fixed charge coverage ratio which represents ebitda divided by fixed charges fixed charges include total interest secured debt principal amortization and preferred dividends 

 

ffo fad and ebitda are financial measures that are widely used by investors equity and debt analysts and rating agencies in the valuation comparison rating and investment recommendations of companies management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results and in making operating decisions additionally ffo and fad are utilized by the board of directors to evaluate management ffo fad and ebitda do not represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with us gaap and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity finally ffo fad and ebitda as defined by us may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies 

 

net operating income “noi” is used to evaluate the operating performance of certain real estate properties such as medical office buildings we define noi as rental revenues including tenant reimbursements less property level operating expenses which exclude depreciation and amortization general and administrative expenses impairments interest expense and discontinued operations we believe noi provides investors relevant and useful information because it measures the operating performance of our medical office buildings at the property level on an unleveraged basis we use noi to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess the property level performance of our medical office buildings

critical accounting policies 

 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap which requires us to make estimates and assumptions management considers an accounting estimate or assumption critical if

management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate and are not reasonably likely to change in the future however since these estimates require assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made they bear the risk of change if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations liquidity andor financial condition please refer to note 1 of our audited consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact us there were no material changes to these policies in 2006 

 

we adopted the fair valuebased method of accounting for sharebased payments effective january 1 2003 using the prospective method described in fasb statement no 148 accounting for stockbased compensation — transition and disclosure because statement 123r must be applied not only to new awards but to previously granted awards that are not fully vested on the effective date of statement 123r and because we adopted statement 123 using the prospective transition method which applied only to awards granted modified or settled after the adoption date of statement 123 compensation cost for some previously granted awards that were not recognized under statement 123 has been recognized under statement 123r additionally we amortize compensation cost for share based payments to the date that the awards become fully vested or to the expected retirement date if sooner effective with the adoption of statement 123r we began recognizing compensation cost to the date the awards become fully vested or to the retirement eligible date if sooner had we adopted statement 123r in prior periods the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share to our audited consolidated financial statements the adoption of statement 123r increased compensation cost by approximately 1287000 for 2006 as a result of amortizing share based awards to the retirement eligible date 

 

the following table presents information about our critical accounting policies as well as the material assumptions used to develop each estimate

impact of inflation 

 

during the past three years inflation has not significantly affected our earnings because of the moderate inflation rate additionally our earnings are primarily longterm investments with fixed rates of return these investments are mainly financed with a combination of equity senior unsecured notes and borrowings under our 

unsecured lines of credit arrangements during inflationary periods which generally are accompanied by rising interest rates our ability to grow may be adversely affected because the yield on new investments may increase at a slower rate than new borrowing costs presuming the current inflation rate remains moderate and longterm interest rates do not increase significantly we believe that inflation will not impact the availability of equity and debt financing for us

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

we are exposed to various market risks including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates we seek to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates by matching the terms of new investments with new longterm fixed rate borrowings to the extent possible we may or may not elect to use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate exposure these decisions are principally based on our policy to fund our fixed rate investments with longterm fixed rate debt and equity but are also based on the general trend in interest rates at the applicable dates and our perception of the future volatility of interest rates the following section is presented to provide a discussion of the risks associated with potential fluctuations in interest rates 

 

we historically borrow on our unsecured lines of credit arrangements to acquire construct or make loans relating to health care and senior housing properties then as market conditions dictate we will issue equity or longterm fixed rate debt to repay the borrowings under the unsecured lines of credit arrangements 

 

a change in interest rates will not affect the interest expense associated with our fixed rate debt interest rate changes however will affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt at december 31 2006 we had 1539830000 of outstanding principal balances related to our senior unsecured notes a 1 increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in fair value of our senior unsecured notes by approximately 71108000 at december 31 2006 at december 31 2005 we had 1194830000 of outstanding principal balances related to our senior unsecured notes a 1 increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in fair value of our senior unsecured notes by approximately 36770000 at december 31 2005 at december 31 2006 we had 363848000 of outstanding principal balances related to our fixed rate secured debt a 1 increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in fair value of our fixed rate secured debt by approximately 17214000 at december 31 2006 at december 31 2005 we had 107540000 of outstanding principal balances related to our fixed rate secured debt a 1 increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in fair value of our fixed rate secured debt by approximately 3962000 at december 31 2005 at december 31 2006 we had 51000000 of outstanding principal balances related to our liability to a subsidiary trust issuing preferred securities a 1 increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in fair value of this liability by approximately 1891000 at december 31 2006 changes in the interest rate environment upon maturity of this fixed rate debt could have an effect on our future cash flows and earnings depending on whether the debt is replaced with other fixed rate debt variable rate debt or equity or repaid by the sale of assets 

 

on may 6 2004 we entered into two interest rate swap agreements the “swaps” for a total notional amount of 100000000 to hedge changes in fair value attributable to changes in the libor swap rate of 100000000 of fixed rate debt with a maturity date of november 15 2013 the swaps are treated as fairvalue hedges for accounting purposes and we utilize the shortcut method in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended the swaps are with highly rated counterparties in which we receive a fixed rate of 60 and pay a variable rate based on sixmonth libor plus a spread at december 31 2006 and 2005 the swaps were reported at their fair values as a 902000 and 2211000 other asset respectively a 1 increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in fair value of our swaps by approximately 4659000 and 6435000 at december 31 2006 and 2005 

 

our variable rate debt including our unsecured lines of credit arrangements and one mortgage loan is reflected at fair value at december 31 2006 we had 239552000 outstanding related to our variable rate debt and assuming no changes in outstanding balances a 1 increase in interest rates would result in increased annual interest expense of 2396000 at december 31 2005 we had 195000000 outstanding related to our variable rate debt and assuming no changes in outstanding balances a 1 increase in interest rates would have resulted in increased annual interest expense of 1950000 

 

we are subject to risks associated with debt financing including the risk that existing indebtedness may not be refinanced or that the terms of refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of current indebtedness the majority of our borrowings were completed under indentures or contractual agreements that limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur accordingly in the event that we are unable to raise additional equity or borrow money because of these limitations our ability to acquire additional properties may be limited

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

 

management has assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on the criteria established by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in a report entitled internal control — integrated framework the scope of management’s assessment as of december 31 2006 did not include an assessment of the internal control over financial reporting for windrose medical properties trust in a purchase business combination on december 20 2006 the acquired business represents 237 of the company’s consolidated total assets at december 31 2006 and 04 of the company’s net income available to common stockholders for the year ended december 31 2006 the scope of management’s assessment on internal control over financial reporting for fiscal year 2007 will include the acquired windrose medical properties trust operations

health care reit inc 

 

we have audited management’s assessment included in management’s report on internal control over financial reporting that health care reit inc maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria health care reit inc’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

 

as indicated in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial property management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of windrose medical properties trust which is included in the consolidated financial statements of health care reit inc and constitute 237 of consolidated total assets as of december 31 2006 and 10 of consolidated revenues for the year then ended management did not include an assessment of the internal control over financial reporting of windrose medical properties trust because it was acquired in a business combination on december 19 2006 

 

in our opinion management’s assessment that health care reit inc maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the coso criteria also in our opinion health care reit inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on the coso criteria

general 

 

health care reit inc a delaware corporation is a selfadministered equity real estate investment trust that invests in health care and senior housing facilities founded in 1970 we were the first real estate investment trust to invest exclusively in health care facilities as of december 31 2005 we had 2858429000 of net real estate investments inclusive of credit enhancements in 442 facilities located in 36 states and managed by 54 different operators at that date the portfolio included 195 assisted living facilities 203 skilled nursing facilities 31 independent livingcontinuing care retirement communities and 13 specialty care facilities 

 

our primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and enhance stockholder value we seek to pay consistent cash dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual increases in rental and interest income and portfolio growth to meet these objectives we invest in properties managed by experienced operators and diversify our investment portfolio by operator and geographic location 

 

depending on the availability and cost of external capital we anticipate investing in additional facilities and entering into operating leases with and loans to qualified operators capital for future investments may be provided by borrowing under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements public or private offerings of debt or equity securities or the incurrence or assumption of secured indebtedness 

 

references herein to “we” “us” “our” or the “company” refer to health care reit inc and its subsidiaries unless specifically noted otherwise 

 

portfolio of properties 

 

the following table summarizes our portfolio as of december 31 2005 

 

 

 

 

  

property types 

 

our primary property investments are skilled nursing facilities assisted living facilities and independent livingcontinuing care retirement communities we also invest in specialty care facilities our properties include standalone facilities that provide one level of service combination facilities that provide multiple levels of service and communities or campuses that provide a wide range of services the following is a summary of our various property types 

assisted living facilities 

 

assisted living facilities are state regulated rental properties that provide the same services as independent living facilities but also provide supportive care from trained employees to residents who require assistance with activities of daily living including management of medications bathing dressing toileting ambulating and eating 

 

alzheimer’sdementia care facilities certain assisted living facilities may include state licensed settings that specialize in caring for those afflicted with alzheimer’s disease andor similar forms of dementia 

 

skilled nursing facilities 

 

skilled nursing facilities are licensed daily rate or rental properties where the majority of individuals require 24hour nursing andor medical care generally these properties are licensed for medicaid andor medicare reimbursement 

 

independent livingcontinuing care retirement communities 

 

these communities may include one or more of the following property types 

 

continuing care retirement communities continuing care retirement communities include a combination of detached homes an independent living facility an assisted living facility andor a skilled nursing facility on one campus resident payment plans vary but can include entrance fees condominium fees and rental fees 

 

active adult communities active adult communities contain primarily forsale singlefamily homes townhomes cluster homes mobile homes andor condominiums with no specialized services these communities are typically restricted or targeted to adults at least 55 years of age or older residents generally lead an independent lifestyle communities may include amenities such as a clubhouse golf course and recreational spaces 

 

independent living facilities independent living facilities are agerestricted multifamily properties with central dining facilities that provide residents access to meals and other services such as housekeeping linen service transportation and social and recreational activities 

 

specialty care facilities 

 

our specialty care facilities include acute care hospitals longterm acute care hospitals and other specialty care hospitals acute care hospitals provide a wide range of inpatient and outpatient services including but not limited to surgery rehabilitation therapy and clinical laboratories longterm acute care hospitals provide inpatient services for patients with complex medical conditions that require more intensive care monitoring or emergency support than that available in most skilled nursing facilities other specialty care hospitals provide specialized inpatient and outpatient services for specific illnesses or diseases including among others orthopedic neurosurgical and behavioral care 

 

investments 

 

we invest in health care and senior housing properties we diversify our investment portfolio by operator and geographic location in determining whether to invest in a facility we focus on the following 1 the experience of the tenant’s or borrower’s management team 2 the historical and projected financial and operational performance of the facility 3 the credit of the tenant or borrower 4 the security for the lease or loan and 5 the capital committed to the facility by the tenant or borrower we conduct market research and analysis for all potential investments in addition we review the value of all facilities the interest rates and covenant requirements of any debt to be assumed and the anticipated sources of repayment of any existing debt that is not to be assumed 

 

our investments are primarily real property leased to operators under longterm operating leases or financed with operators under longterm mortgage loans construction financing is provided but only as part of a longterm operating lease or mortgage loan substantially all of our investments are designed with escalating rate structures depending upon market conditions we believe that new investments will be available in the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to our stockholders operating leases and mortgage loans are normally credit enhanced by guaranties andor letters of credit typically operating leases are structured 

as master leases and mortgage loans are crossdefaulted and crosscollateralized with other mortgage loans operating leases or agreements between us and the operator and its affiliates 

 

at december 31 2005 87 of our owned real property was subject to master leases a master lease is a lease of multiple facilities to one tenant entity under a single lease agreement from time to time we may acquire additional facilities that are then leased to the tenant under the master lease the tenant is required to make one monthly payment that represents rent on all the properties that are subject to the master lease typically the master lease tenant can exercise its right to purchase the facilities or to renew the master lease only with respect to all leased facilities at the same time this bundling feature benefits us because the tenant cannot limit the purchase or renewal to the better performing facilities and terminate the leasing arrangement with respect to the poorer performing facilities this spreads our risk among the entire group of facilities within the master lease the bundling feature may provide a similar advantage if the master lease tenant is in bankruptcy subject to certain restrictions a debtor in bankruptcy has the right to assume or reject each of its leases it is our intent that a tenant in bankruptcy would be required to assume or reject the master lease as a whole rather than deciding on a facility by facility basis 

 

we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of facility and operator our asset management process includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each facility periodic review of operator creditworthiness periodic facility inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure real estate taxes letters of credit and other collateral in monitoring our portfolio our personnel use a proprietary database to collect and analyze facilityspecific data additionally we conduct extensive research to ascertain industry trends and risks 

 

through asset management and research we evaluate the operating environment in each facility’s market to determine whether payment risk is likely to increase when we identify unacceptable levels of payment risk we seek to mitigate eliminate or transfer the risk we categorize the risk as operator facility or market risk for operator risk we typically find a substitute operator to run the facility for facility risk we usually work with the operator to institute facilitylevel management changes to address the risk finally for market risk we often encourage an operator to change its capital structure including refinancing the facility or raising additional equity through these asset management and research efforts we are generally able to intervene at an early stage to address payment risk and in so doing support both the collectibility of revenue and the value of our investment 

 

operating leases 

 

each facility which includes the land building improvements and related rights owned by us is leased to an operator pursuant to a longterm operating lease as discussed above most of our leased properties are subject to master leases these leases generally have a fixed contractual term of 12 to 15 years and contain one or more five to 15year renewal options each lease is a net lease requiring the tenant to pay rent and all additional charges incurred in the operation of the leased property the tenants are required to repair rebuild and maintain the leased properties 

 

the net value of our completed leased properties aggregated approximately 2658019000 at december 31 2005 prior to june 2004 our standard lease structure contained fixed annual rental escalators which were generally recognized on a straightline basis over the initial lease period beginning in june 2004 our new standard lease structure contains annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the consumer price index andor changes in the gross operating revenues of the tenant’s properties these escalators are not fixed so no straightline rent is recorded however rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period this lease structure initially generates lower revenues and earnings compared to leases with fixed escalators that require straightlining but enables us to generate additional organic growth and minimize noncash straightline rent over time this change does not affect our cash flow or our ability to pay dividends 

 

we currently provide for the construction of facilities for tenants as part of longterm operating leases we capitalize certain interest costs associated with funds used to pay for the construction of properties owned by us the amount capitalized is based upon the amount advanced during the construction period using the rate of interest that approximates our cost of financing our interest expense is reduced by the amount capitalized we also typically charge a transaction fee at the commencement of construction the construction period commences upon funding and terminates upon the earlier of the completion of the applicable facility or the end of a specified period during the construction period we advance funds to the operator in accordance with agreed upon terms and conditions 

which require among other things site visits by a company representative prior to advancement of funds during the construction period we generally require an additional credit enhancement in the form of payment and performance bonds andor completion guaranties at december 31 2005 we had outstanding construction investments of 3906000 for leased properties and were committed to providing additional funds of approximately 36519000 to complete construction 

 

mortgage loans 

 

our investments in mortgage loans are typically structured to provide us with interest income principal amortization and transaction fees and are generally secured by a first or second mortgage lien or leasehold mortgage at december 31 2005 the interest yield excluding any loans on nonaccrual averaged approximately 92 per annum on our outstanding mortgage loan balances our yield on mortgage loans depends upon a number of factors including the stated interest rate average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments the mortgage loans outstanding at december 31 2005 are generally subject to three to 20year terms with principal amortization schedules andor balloon payments of the outstanding principal balances at the end of the term generally the mortgage loans provide three to eight years of prepayment protection 

 

working capital loans 

 

working capital loans are generally either unsecured or secured by the operator’s leasehold rights corporate guaranties andor personal guaranties these instruments have terms generally ranging from three months to ten years at december 31 2005 the average interest yield excluding any loans on nonaccrual was approximately 103 per annum on our outstanding working capital loan balances at december 31 2005 we had provided working capital loans to eight operators loans that were previously classified as subdebt investments have been reclassified as working capital loans 

 

equity investments 

 

we had an investment in atlantic healthcare finance lp a property group that specializes in the financing through sale and leaseback transactions of nursing and care homes located in the united kingdom this investment was accounted for under the equity method of accounting because we had the ability to exercise significant influence but not control over the company due to our 31 ownership interest in october 2003 we sold our investment in atlantic healthcare finance lp generating a net gain of 902000 

 

other equity investments which consist of investments in private and public companies for which we do not have the ability to exercise influence are accounted for under the cost method under the cost method of accounting investments in private companies are carried at cost and are adjusted only for otherthantemporary declines in fair value distributions of earnings and additional investments for investments in public companies that have readily determinable fair market values we classify our equity investments as availableforsale and accordingly record these investments at their fair market values with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income a separate component of stockholders’ equity these investments represent a minimal ownership interest in these companies 

borrowing policies 

 

we utilize a combination of debt and equity to fund the purchase of new properties and to provide loan financing our debt and equity levels are determined by management to maintain a conservative credit profile generally we intend to issue unsecured fixed rate public debt with longterm maturities to approximate the maturities on our leases and loans for shortterm purposes we may borrow on our unsecured lines of credit arrangements we replace these borrowings with longterm capital such as senior unsecured notes common stock or preferred stock when terms are deemed favorable we may invest in properties subject to existing mortgage indebtedness in addition we may obtain secured financing for unleveraged properties in which we have invested or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis it is our intent to limit secured indebtedness in our agreements with our lenders we are subject to restrictions with respect to secured and unsecured indebtedness 

 

operator concentrations 

 

the following table summarizes certain information about our operator concentrations as of december 31 2005 dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

competition 

 

we compete with other real estate investment trusts real estate partnerships banks insurance companies finance companies governmentsponsored agencies taxable and taxexempt bond funds and other investors in the acquisition leasing and financing of health care and senior housing properties we compete for investments based on a number of factors including rates financings offered underwriting criterion and reputation the operators of our facilities compete on a local and regional basis with operators of facilities that provide comparable services 

operators compete for patients and residents based on a number of factors including quality of care reputation physical appearance of facilities services offered family preferences physicians staff and price 

 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2005 we employed 42 fulltime employees 

 

certain government regulations 

 

health law matters — generally 

 

we invest in assisted living skilled nursing independent livingcontinuing care retirement communities and specialty care facilities which represented approximately 34 44 15 and 7 respectively of our investments at december 31 2005 

 

typically operators of assisted living and independent living facilities do not receive significant funding from governmental programs and are regulated by the states not the federal government operators of skilled nursing and specialty care facilities are subject to federal and state laws that regulate the type and quality of the medical andor nursing care provided ancillary services eg respiratory occupational physical and infusion therapies qualifications of the administrative personnel and nursing staff the adequacy of the physical plant and equipment distribution of pharmaceuticals reimbursement and rate setting and operating policies in addition as described below some of our facility operators are subject to extensive laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including kickbacks physician selfreferrals and false claims 

 

licensing and certification 

 

the primary regulations that affect assisted living facilities are the states’ licensing laws in granting and renewing these licenses the regulatory authorities consider numerous factors relating to a facility’s physical plant and operations including but not limited to admission and discharge standards and staffing and training a decision to grant or renew a license is also affected by a facility’s record with respect to consumer rights and medication guidelines and rules 

 

generally our skilled nursing and specialty care facilities are required to be licensed on an annual or biannual basis and to be certified for participation in the medicare and medicaid programs the failure of our operators to maintain or renew any required license or regulatory approval or the failure to correct serious survey deficiencies could prevent them from continuing operations at a property in addition if a facility is found out of compliance with the conditions of participation in medicare medicaid or other health care programs the facility may be barred from participation in government reimbursement programs any of these occurrences may impair the ability of our operators to meet their obligations to us if we have to replace a facility operator our ability to replace the operator may be affected by federal and state rules and policies governing changes in control this may result in payment delays an inability to find a replacement operator a significant working capital commitment from us to a new operator or other difficulties 

 

reimbursement 

 

assisted living facilities approximately 46 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2005 were attributable to assisted living facilities the majority of the revenues received by the operators of our assisted living facilities are from private pay sources the remaining revenue source is primarily medicaid waiver programs as a part of the omnibus budget reconciliation act “obra” of 1981 congress established a waiver program under medicaid to offer an alternative to institutional longterm care services the provisions of obra and the subsequent obra acts of 1987 and 1990 allow states flexibility in developing costeffective alternatives to longterm care including assisted living and home health at december 31 2005 seven of our 23 assisted living operators utilized medicaid waivers for the 12 months ended september 30 2005 approximately 12 of the revenues at our assisted living facilities were from medicaid reimbursement 

 

rates paid by selfpay residents are set by the facilities and are largely determined by local market conditions and operating costs generally facilities receive a higher payment per day for a private pay resident than for a 

medicaid beneficiary who requires a comparable level of care the level of medicaid reimbursement varies from state to state thus the revenues generated by operators of our assisted living facilities may be adversely affected by payor mix acuity level and changes in medicaid eligibility and reimbursement levels changes in revenues could in turn have a material adverse effect on an operator’s ability to meet its obligations to us 

 

skilled nursing facilities and specialty care facilities skilled nursing and specialty care facilities typically receive most of their revenues from medicare and medicaid with the balance representing private pay including private insurance consequently changes in federal or state reimbursement policies may also adversely affect an operator’s ability to cover its expenses including our rent or debt service skilled nursing and specialty care facilities are subject to periodic pre and postpayment reviews and other audits by federal and state authorities a review or audit of claims of a facility operator could result in recoupments denials or delays of payments in the future which could have a material adverse effect on the operator’s ability to meet its obligations to us due to the significant judgments and estimates inherent in payor settlement accounting no assurance can be given as to the adequacy of any reserves maintained by our facility operators for potential adjustments to reimbursements for payor settlements due to budgetary constraints governmental payors may limit or reduce payments to skilled nursing and specialty care facilities as a result of government reimbursement programs being subject to such budgetary pressures and legislative and administrative actions an operator’s ability to meet its obligations to us may be significantly impaired 

 

medicare reimbursement and skilled nursing facilities for the 12 months ended september 30 2005 approximately 29 of the revenues at our skilled nursing facilities which comprised 42 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2005 were from medicare reimbursement in an effort to reduce federal spending on health care the balanced budget act of 1997 “bba” fundamentally altered medicare payment methodologies for skilled nursing facilities by mandating the institution of the skilled nursing facility prospective payment system the prospective payment system caused medicare per diem reimbursement for skilled nursing facility services to decrease the reductions in medicare payments resulted in immediate financial difficulties for skilled nursing facilities and caused a number of operators to seek bankruptcy protection the federal government subsequently passed legislation to lessen the negative financial impact from the prospective payment system these payment increases have since expired 

 

skilled nursing facilities received a 31 inflationary market basket increase in medicare payments for federal fiscal year 2006 which represents 530 million of additional medicare spending however aggregate medicare expenditures in federal fiscal year 2006 are expected to increase by only 20 million because the market basket increase will be largely offset by the refinement of the resource utilization group “rug” system effective january 1 2006 the centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” introduced nine new payment categories increasing the number of rugs from 44 to 53 the new categories are intended to compensate providers for the care of medically complex patients concurrent with the rug refinement cms increased the rates for all rugs to reflect variations in nontherapy ancillary costs that were not fully captured in the rug refinement this adjustment increases aggregate medicare payments by roughly 3 and represents a permanent payment increase that will be integrated into the base line spending levels however due to a decrease of 6 from the loss of temporary payment adjustments that will cease as a result of the new classification system the overall increase is only 01 on average we expect medicare rates in our portfolio to decrease slightly in 2006 the net impact varies by facility depending on geographical region rug distribution urban versus nonurban location freestanding versus hospitalbased and the operator’s ability to adapt to the new rugs 

 

the moratorium on the therapy caps for part b outpatient rehabilitation services which had applied through december 31 2005 expired the therapy caps were mandated by the bba the annual payment cap of 1740 per patient applies to occupational and physical therapy and a separate 1740 cap applies to speech therapy patients exceeding the cap will be able to obtain additional medicare coverage if the therapy is deemed medically necessary otherwise the patient would need to use private funds to pay for the cost of therapy above the caps 

 

medicare reimbursement and specialty care facilities for the 12 months ended september 30 2005 approximately 50 of the revenues at our specialty care facilities which comprised 6 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2005 were from medicare specialty care facilities generally are reimbursed by medicare under either the diagnosis related group prospective payment system reimbursement methodology for inpatient 

hospitals or the longterm acute care hospital prospective payment system for longterm acute care hospitals acute care hospitals provide a wide range of inpatient and outpatient services including but not limited to surgery rehabilitation therapy and clinical laboratories longterm acute care hospitals provide inpatient services for patients with complex medical conditions that require more intensive care monitoring or emergency support than that available in most skilled nursing facilities some of our other specialty care facilities provide specialized inpatient and outpatient services for specific illnesses or diseases including among others orthopedic neurosurgical and behavioral care services 

 

with respect to medicare’s diagnosis related groupoutpatient prospective payment system methodology for regular hospitals reimbursement for inpatient services is on the basis of a fixed prospective rate based on the principal diagnosis of the patient diagnoses are grouped into more than 500 diagnosis related groups in some cases a hospital might be able to qualify for an outlier payment if the hospital’s losses exceed a threshold 

 

on january 19 2006 the cms released its proposed payment rule for longterm acute care hospitals “ltachs” for fiscal year 2007 which begins on july 1 2006 among other changes the proposed rule would eliminate the market basket increase and change the payment rates for outliers cms projects that the proposed rule will reduce aggregate medicare ltach payments by approximately 11 in fiscal 2007 the proposal is subject to a 60 day comment period our portfolio includes nine ltachs with an investment balance of 124668000 which represents 4 of our total investment balance 

 

congress has limited increases in diagnosis related groups or outpatient prospective payment system payments these limited increases may not be sufficient to cover specialty care facilities’ increasing costs of providing care failure to increase reimbursement to cover increased costs or reductions or freezes in payment rates will have an adverse impact on operators of our specialty care facilities 

 

medicaid reimbursement medicaid is a major payor source for residents in our skilled nursing and specialty care facilities for the 12 months ended september 30 2005 approximately 55 of the revenues of our skilled nursing facilities and 23 of the revenues of our specialty care facilities were attributable to medicaid payments the federal government and the states share responsibility for financing medicaid the federal matching rate known as the federal medical assistance percentage varies by state based on relative per capita income on average medicaid is the largest component of total state spending representing approximately 22 of total state spending the percentage of medicaid dollars used for longterm care varies from state to state due in part to different ratios of elderly population and eligibility requirements with certain federal guidelines states have a wide range of discretion to determine eligibility and reimbursement methodology many states reimburse longterm care facilities using fixed daily rates which are applied prospectively based on the historical costs incurred in providing patient care reasonable costs typically include allowances for staffing administrative and general and property and equipment eg depreciation and fair rental 

 

in most states medicaid does not fully reimburse the cost of providing skilled nursing services certain states are attempting to slow the rate of growth in medicaid expenditures by freezing rates or restricting eligibility and benefits states in which we have skilled nursing facility investments increased their per diem medicaid rates roughly 3 on average for fiscal year 2006 none of our states reduced medicaid rates across the board in fiscal year 2006 although certain facilities experienced reduced rates due to changes in acuity in addition nine of our states effectively froze rates in fiscal year 2006 which impacts profitability to the extent that expenses continue to rise in addition medicaid rates may decline if revenues in a particular state are not sufficient to fund budgeted expenditures 

 

the medicare part d drug benefit became effective january 1 2006 the direct impact on nursing facilities is that residents dually eligible for medicare and medicaid now receive drugs through medicare part d rather than through medicaid participants began enrolling in the new part d prescription drug plans on november 15 2005 part d will result in increased administrative responsibilities for nursing home operators because residents have the choice of multiple prescription drug plans operators may also experience increased expenses to the extent that patients’ drugs are not covered by their prescription drug plan formulary 

 

the reimbursement methodologies applied to health care facilities continue to evolve federal and state authorities have considered and may seek to implement new or modified reimbursement methodologies that may 

negatively impact health care facility operations the impact of any such change if implemented may result in a material adverse effect on our skilled nursing and specialty care facility operations no assurance can be given that current revenue sources or levels will be maintained accordingly there can be no assurance that payments under a government reimbursement program are currently or will in the future be sufficient to fully reimburse the facility operators for their operating and capital expenses as a result an operator’s ability to meet its obligations to us could be adversely impacted 

 

other related laws 

 

skilled nursing and specialty care facilities and assisted living facilities that receive medicaid payments are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations which govern the operations and financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by health care providers certain of these laws prohibit direct or indirect payments of any kind for the purpose of inducing or encouraging the referral of patients for medical products or services reimbursable by governmental programs other laws require providers to furnish only medically necessary services and submit to the government valid and accurate statements for each service still other laws require providers to comply with a variety of safety health and other requirements relating to the condition of the licensed facility and the quality of care provided sanctions for violation of these laws and regulations may include but are not limited to criminal andor civil penalties and fines and a loss of licensure and immediate termination of governmental payments in certain circumstances violation of these rules such as those prohibiting abusive and fraudulent behavior with respect to one facility may subject other facilities under common control or ownership to sanctions including disqualification from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs in the ordinary course of its business a facility operator is regularly subjected to inquiries investigations and audits by federal and state agencies that oversee these laws and regulations 

 

each skilled nursing and specialty care facility and any assisted living facility that receives medicaid payments is subject to the federal antikickback statute that generally prohibits persons from offering providing soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing of a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal health care program such as the medicare and medicaid programs skilled nursing and specialty care facilities are also subject to the federal ethics in patient referral act of 1989 commonly referred to as the stark law the stark law generally prohibits the submission of claims to medicare for payment if the claim results from a physician referral for certain designated services and the physician has a financial relationship with the health service provider that does not qualify under one of the exceptions for a financial relationship under the stark law similar prohibitions on physician selfreferrals and submission of claims apply to state medicaid programs further skilled nursing and specialty care facilities and assisted living facilities that receive medicaid payments are subject to substantial financial penalties under the civil monetary penalties act and the false claims act and in particular actions under the false claims act’s “whistleblower” provisions private enforcement of health care fraud has increased due in large part to amendments to the false claims act that encourage private individuals to sue on behalf of the government these whistleblower suits by private individuals known as qui tam actions may be filed by almost anyone including present and former patients nurses and other employees prosecutions investigations or qui tam actions could have a material adverse effect on a facility operator’s liquidity financial condition and results of operations which could adversely affect the ability of the operator to meet its obligations to us finally various state false claim and antikickback laws also may apply to each facility operator violation of any of the foregoing statutes can result in criminal andor civil penalties that could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its obligations to us 

 

the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 which became effective january 1 1997 greatly expanded the definition of health care fraud and related offenses and broadened its scope to include private health care plans in addition to government payors it also greatly increased funding for the department of justice federal bureau of investigation and the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services to audit investigate and prosecute suspected health care fraud 

 

additionally the administrative simplification provisions of this law provide for communication of health information through standard electronic transaction formats and for the privacy and security of health information in order to comply with the regulations health care providers must undergo significant operational and technical changes 

finally government investigation and enforcement of health care laws has increased dramatically over the past several years and is expected to continue some of these enforcement actions represent novel legal theories and expansions in the application of false claims laws the costs for an operator of a health care facility associated with both defending such enforcement actions and the undertakings in settlement agreements can be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its obligations to us

general 

 

we elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust or “reit” commencing with our first taxable year we intend to continue to operate in such a manner as to qualify as a reit but there is no guarantee that we will qualify or remain qualified as a reit for subsequent years qualification and taxation as a reit depends upon our ability to meet a variety of qualification tests imposed under federal income tax law with respect to income assets distribution level and diversity of share ownership as discussed below under “— qualification as a reit” there can be no assurance that we will be owned and organized and will operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified 

 

in any year in which we qualify as a reit in general we will not be subject to federal income tax on that portion of our reit taxable income or capital gain that is distributed to stockholders we may however be subject to tax at normal corporate rates on any taxable income or capital gain not distributed if we elect to retain and pay income tax on our net longterm capital gain stockholders are required to include their proportionate share of our undistributed longterm capital gain in income but they will receive a refundable credit for their share of any taxes paid by us on such gain 

 

despite the reit election we may be subject to federal income and excise tax as follows 

 

 12 

 

  

if we acquire any assets from a corporation which is or has been a “c” corporation in a carryover basis transaction we could be liable for specified liabilities that are inherited from the “c” corporation a “c” corporation is generally defined as a corporation that is required to pay full corporate level federal income tax if we recognize gain on the disposition of the assets during the tenyear period beginning on the date on which the assets were acquired by us then to the extent of the assets’ “builtin gain” ie the excess of the fair market value of the asset over the adjusted tax basis in the asset in each case determined as of the beginning of the tenyear period we will be subject to tax on the gain at the highest regular corporate rate applicable the results described in this paragraph with respect to the recognition of builtin gain assume that the builtin gain assets at the time the builtin gain assets were subject to a conversion transaction either where a “c” corporation elected reit status or a reit acquired the assets from a “c” corporation were not treated as sold to an unrelated party and gain recognized 

 

qualification as a reit 

 

a reit is defined as a corporation trust or association 

 

  

conditions 1 to 4 inclusive must be met during the entire taxable year and condition 5 must be met during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months for purposes of conditions 5 and 6 pension funds and certain other taxexempt entities are treated as individuals subject to a “lookthrough” exception in the case of condition 6 

based on publicly available information we believe we have satisfied the share ownership requirements set forth in 5 and 6 above in addition article vi of our amended and restated bylaws provides for restrictions regarding ownership and transfer of shares these restrictions are intended to assist us in continuing to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in 5 and 6 above these restrictions however may not ensure that we will in all cases be able to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in 5 and 6 above 

 

we have complied with and will continue to comply with regulatory rules to send annual letters to certain of our stockholders requesting information regarding the actual ownership of our stock if despite sending the annual letters we do not know or after exercising reasonable diligence would not have known whether we failed to meet the five or fewer requirement we will be treated as having met the five or fewer requirement if we fail to comply with these regulatory rules we will be subject to a monetary penalty if our failure to comply was due to intentional disregard of the requirement the penalty would be increased however if our failure to comply were due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect no penalty would be imposed 

 

we may own a number of properties through wholly owned subsidiaries a corporation will qualify as a “qualified reit subsidiary” if 100 of its stock is owned by a reit and the reit does not elect to treat the subsidiary as a taxable reit subsidiary a “qualified reit subsidiary” will not be treated as a separate corporation and all assets liabilities and items of income deductions and credits of a “qualified reit subsidiary” will be treated as assets liabilities and items as the case may be of the reit a “qualified reit subsidiary” is not subject to federal income tax and our ownership of the voting stock of a qualified reit subsidiary will not violate the restrictions against ownership of securities of any one issuer which constitute more than 10 of the value or total voting power of such issuer or more than 5 of the value of our total assets as described below under “— asset tests” 

 

if we invest in a partnership a limited liability company or a trust taxed as a partnership or as a disregarded entity we will be deemed to own a proportionate share of the partnership’s limited liability company’s or trust’s assets likewise we will be treated as receiving our share of the income and loss of the partnership limited liability company or trust and the gross income will retain the same character in our hands as it has in the hands of the partnership limited liability company or trust these “lookthrough” rules apply for purposes of the income tests and assets tests described below 

 

income tests there are two separate percentage tests relating to our sources of gross income that we must satisfy for each taxable year 

 

  

for taxable years beginning on or before october 22 2004 1 payments to us under an interest rate swap or cap agreement option futures contract forward rate agreement or any similar financial instrument entered into by us to reduce interest rate risk on indebtedness incurred or to be incurred and 2 gain from the sale or other disposition of any such investment are treated as income qualifying under the 95 gross income test as to transactions entered into in taxable years beginning after october 22 2004 any of our income from a “clearly identified” hedging transaction that is entered into by us in the normal course of business directly or indirectly to manage the risk of interest rate movements price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings or obligations incurred or to be incurred by us or such other risks that are prescribed by the internal revenue service is excluded from the 95 gross income test in general a hedging transaction is “clearly identified” if 1 the transaction is identified as a hedging transaction before the end of the day on which it is entered into and 2 the items or risks being hedged are identified “substantially contemporaneously” with the hedging transaction an identification is not substantially contemporaneous if it is made more than 35 days after entering into the hedging transaction 

rents received by us will qualify as “rents from real property” for purposes of satisfying the gross income tests for a reit only if several conditions are met 

 

  

for taxable years beginning after august 5 1997 a reit has been permitted to render a de minimis amount of impermissible services to tenants and still treat amounts received with respect to that property as rent from real property the amount received or accrued by the reit during the taxable year for the impermissible services with respect to a property may not exceed 1 of all amounts received or accrued by the reit directly or indirectly from the property the amount received for any service or management operation for this purpose shall be deemed to be not less than 150 of the direct cost of the reit in furnishing or rendering the service or providing the management or operation furthermore impermissible services may be furnished to tenants by a taxable reit subsidiary subject to certain conditions and we may still treat rents received with respect to the property as rent from real property 

 

the term “interest” generally does not include any amount if the determination of the amount depends in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person although an amount generally will not be excluded from the term “interest” solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage of receipts or sales 

 

if we fail to satisfy one or both of the 75 or 95 gross income tests for any taxable year we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for such year if we are eligible for relief for taxable years beginning on or before october 22 2004 these relief provisions generally will be available if 1 our failure to meet such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect 2 we attach a schedule of the sources of our income to our return and 3 any incorrect information on the schedule was not due to fraud with intent to evade tax for taxable years beginning after october 22 2004 these relief provisions generally will be available if 1 following our identification of the failure we file a schedule for such taxable year describing each item of our gross income and 2 the failure to meet such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect 

 

it is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions if these relief provisions apply a 100 tax is imposed on an amount equal to a the gross income attributable to 1 75 of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75 income test and 2 95 of our gross income 90 of our gross income for taxable years beginning on or before october 22 2004 over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 95 income test multiplied by b a fraction intended to reflect our profitability 

 

asset tests within 30 days after the close of each quarter of our taxable year we must also satisfy several tests relating to the nature and diversification of our assets determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles at least 75 of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets cash cash items including receivables arising in the ordinary course of our operation government securities and qualified temporary investments although the remaining 25 of our assets generally may be invested without restriction we are prohibited from owning securities representing more than 10 of either the vote the “10 vote 

test” or value the “10 value test” of the outstanding securities of any issuer other than a qualified reit subsidiary another reit or a taxable reit subsidiary further no more than 20 of the total assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries the “20 asset test” and no more than 5 of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities of any nongovernmental issuer other than a qualified reit subsidiary the “5 asset test” another reit or a taxable reit subsidiary each of the 10 vote test the 10 value test and the 20 and 5 asset tests must be satisfied at the end of each quarter there are special rules which provide relief if the value related tests are not satisfied due to changes in the value of the assets of a reit 

 

for taxable years beginning after december 31 2000 certain items are excluded from the 10 value test including 1 straight debt securities of an issuer including straight debt that provides certain contingent payments 2 any loan to an individual or an estate 3 any rental agreement described in section 467 of the internal revenue code other than with a “related person” 4 any obligation to pay rents from real property 5 certain securities issued by a state or any subdivision thereof the district of columbia a foreign government or any political subdivision thereof or the commonwealth of puerto rico 6 any security issued by a reit and 7 any other arrangement that as determined by the secretary of the treasury is excepted from the definition of security “excluded securities” special rules apply to straight debt securities issued by corporations and entities taxable as partnerships for federal income tax purposes if a reit or its taxable reit subsidiary holds 1 straight debt securities of a corporate or partnership issuer and 2 securities of such issuer that are not excluded securities and have an aggregate value greater than 1 of such issuer’s outstanding securities the straight debt securities will be included in the 10 value test 

 

for taxable years beginning after december 31 2000 a reit’s interest as a partner in a partnership is not treated as a security for purposes of applying the 10 value test to securities issued by the partnership further any debt instrument issued by a partnership will not be a security for purposes of applying the 10 value test 1 to the extent of the reit’s interest as a partner in the partnership and 2 if at least 75 of the partnership’s gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions would qualify for the 75 gross income test for taxable years beginning after october 22 2004 for purposes of the 10 value test a reit’s interest in a partnership’s assets is the reit’s proportionate interest in any securities issued by the partnership other than the excluded securities described in the preceding paragraph 

 

with respect to corrections of failures for which the requirements for corrections are satisfied after october 22 2004 regardless of whether such failures occurred in taxable years beginning on before or after such date as to violations of the 10 vote test the 10 value test or the 5 asset test a reit may avoid disqualification as a reit by disposing of sufficient assets to cure a violation that does not exceed the lesser of 1 of the reit’s assets at the end of the relevant quarter or 10000000 provided that the disposition occurs within six months following the last day of the quarter in which the reit first identified the assets for violations of any of the reit asset tests due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that exceed the thresholds described in the preceding sentence a reit can avoid disqualification as a reit after the close of a taxable quarter by taking certain steps including disposition of sufficient assets within the six month period described above to meet the applicable asset test paying a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets during the period of time that the assets were held as nonqualifying assets and filing a schedule with the internal revenue service that describes the nonqualifying assets 

 

investments in taxable reit subsidiaries for taxable years beginning after december 31 2000 reits may own more than 10 of the voting power and value of securities in taxable reit subsidiaries we and any taxable corporate entity in which we own an interest are allowed to jointly elect to treat such entity as a “taxable reit subsidiary” 

 

several of our subsidiaries have elected to be treated as a taxable reit subsidiary taxable reit subsidiaries are subject to full corporate level federal taxation on their earnings but are permitted to engage in certain types of activities that cannot be performed directly by reits without jeopardizing their reit status our taxable reit subsidiaries will attempt to minimize the amount of these taxes but there can be no assurance whether or the extent to which measures taken to minimize taxes will be successful to the extent our taxable reit subsidiaries are required to pay federal state or local taxes the cash available for distribution as dividends to us from our taxable reit subsidiaries will be reduced 

the amount of interest on relatedparty debt that a taxable reit subsidiary may deduct is limited further a 100 tax applies to any interest payments by a taxable reit subsidiary to its affiliated reit to the extent the interest rate is not commercially reasonable a taxable reit subsidiary is permitted to deduct interest payments to unrelated parties without any of these restrictions 

 

the internal revenue service may reallocate costs between a reit and its taxable reit subsidiary where there is a lack of arm’slength dealing between the parties any deductible expenses allocated away from a taxable reit subsidiary would increase its tax liability further any amount by which a reit understates its deductions and overstates those of its taxable reit subsidiary will subject to certain exceptions be subject to a 100 tax additional taxable reit subsidiary elections may be made in the future for additional entities in which we own an interest 

 

annual distribution requirements in order to avoid being taxed as a regular corporation we are required to make distributions other than capital gain distributions to our stockholders which qualify for the dividends paid deduction in an amount at least equal to 1 the sum of i 90 of our “reit taxable income” computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain and ii 90 of the aftertax net income if any from foreclosure property minus 2 a portion of certain items of noncash income these distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for that year and if paid on or before the first regular distribution payment after such declaration the amount distributed must not be preferential this means that every stockholder of the class of stock to which a distribution is made must be treated the same as every other stockholder of that class and no class of stock may be treated otherwise than in accordance with its dividend rights as a class to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our “reit taxable income” as adjusted we will be subject to tax on the undistributed amount at regular corporate tax rates finally as discussed above we may be subject to an excise tax if we fail to meet certain other distribution requirements we intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy these annual distribution requirements 

 

it is possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90 distribution requirement or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation due to among other things 1 timing differences between i the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses and ii the inclusion of income and deduction of expenses in arriving at our taxable income or 2 the payment of severance benefits that may not be deductible to us in the event that timing differences occur we may find it necessary to arrange for borrowings or if possible pay dividends in the form of taxable stock dividends in order to meet the distribution requirement 

 

under certain circumstances in the event of a deficiency determined by the internal revenue service we may be able to rectify a resulting failure to meet the distribution requirement for a year by paying “deficiency dividends” to stockholders in a later year which may be included in our deduction for distributions paid for the earlier year thus we may be able to avoid being taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency distributions however we will be required to pay applicable penalties and interest based upon the amount of any deduction taken for deficiency distributions 

 

failure to qualify as a reit 

 

if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates distributions to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify as a reit will not be deductible nor will any particular amount of distributions be required to be made in any year all distributions to stockholders will be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these distributions and subject to certain limitations will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporate stockholders unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions we also will be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to statutory relief failure to qualify for even one year could result in our need to incur indebtedness or liquidate investments in order to pay potentially significant resulting tax liabilities 

in addition to the relief described above under “— income tests” and ‘‘— asset tests” relief is available in the event that we violate a provision of the internal revenue code that would result in our failure to qualify as a reit if 1 the violation is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect 2 we pay a penalty of 50000 for each failure to satisfy the provision and 3 the violation does not include a violation described under “— income tests” or “— asset tests” above it is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions 

 

federal income taxation of holders of our stock 

 

treatment of taxable us stockholders the following summary applies to you only if you are a “us stockholder” a “us stockholder” is a stockholder of shares of stock who for united states federal income tax purposes is 

 

  

so long as we qualify for taxation as a reit distributions on shares of our stock made out of the current or accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these distributions and not designated as capital gain dividends will be includable as ordinary income for federal income tax purposes none of these distributions will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for us corporate stockholders 

 

generally for taxable years ending after may 6 2003 through december 31 2008 the maximum marginal rate of tax payable by individuals on dividends received from corporations that are subject to a corporate level of tax is 15 except in limited circumstances this tax rate will not apply to dividends paid to you by us on our shares because generally we are not subject to federal income tax on the portion of our reit taxable income or capital gains distributed to our stockholders the reduced maximum federal income tax rate will apply to that portion if any of dividends received by you with respect to our shares that are attributable to 1 dividends received by us from nonreit corporations or other taxable reit subsidiaries 2 income from the prior year with respect to which we were required to pay federal corporate income tax during the prior year if for example we did not distribute 100 of our reit taxable income for the prior year or 3 the amount of any earnings and profits that were distributed by us and accumulated in a nonreit year 

 

distributions that are designated as capital gain dividends will be taxed as longterm capital gains to the extent they do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year without regard to the period for which you held our stock however if you are a corporation you may be required to treat a portion of some capital gain dividends as ordinary income 

 

if we elect to retain and pay income tax on any net longterm capital gain you would include in income as longterm capital gain your proportionate share of this net longterm capital gain you would also receive a refundable tax credit for your proportionate share of the tax paid by us on such retained capital gains and you would have an increase in the basis of your shares of our stock in an amount equal to your includable capital gains less your share of the tax deemed paid 

 

you may not include in your federal income tax return any of our net operating losses or capital losses federal income tax rules may also require that certain minimum tax adjustments and preferences be apportioned to you in addition any distribution declared by us in october november or december of any year on a specified date in any such month shall be treated as both paid by us and received by you on december 31 of that year provided that the distribution is actually paid by us no later than january 31 of the following year 

we will be treated as having sufficient earnings and profits to treat as a dividend any distribution up to the amount required to be distributed in order to avoid imposition of the 4 excise tax discussed under “— general” and “— qualification as a reit — annual distribution requirements” above as a result you may be required to treat as taxable dividends certain distributions that would otherwise result in a taxfree return of capital moreover any “deficiency dividend” will be treated as a dividend an ordinary dividend or a capital gain dividend as the case may be regardless of our earnings and profits any other distributions in excess of current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to you to the extent these distributions do not exceed the adjusted tax basis of your shares of our stock you will be required to reduce the tax basis of your shares of our stock by the amount of these distributions until the basis has been reduced to zero after which these distributions will be taxable as capital gain if the shares of our stock are held as a capital asset the tax basis as so reduced will be used in computing the capital gain or loss if any realized upon sale of the shares of our stock any loss upon a sale or exchange of shares of our stock which were held for six months or less after application of certain holding period rules will generally be treated as a longterm capital loss to the extent you previously received capital gain distributions with respect to these shares of our stock 

 

upon the sale or exchange of any shares of our stock to or with a person other than us or a sale or exchange of all shares of our stock whether actually or constructively owned with us you will generally recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your adjusted tax basis in these shares of our stock this gain will be capital gain if you held these shares of our stock as a capital asset 

 

if we redeem any of your shares in us the treatment can only be determined on the basis of particular facts at the time of redemption in general you will recognize gain or loss as opposed to dividend income equal to the difference between the amount received by you in the redemption and your adjusted tax basis in your shares redeemed if such redemption results in a “complete termination” of your interest in all classes of our equity securities is a “substantially disproportionate redemption” or is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” with respect to you in applying these tests there must be taken into account your ownership of all classes of our equity securities eg common stock preferred stock depositary shares and warrants you also must take into account any equity securities that are considered to be constructively owned by you 

 

if as a result of a redemption by us of your shares you no longer own either actually or constructively any of our equity securities or only own actually and constructively an insubstantial percentage of our equity securities then it is probable that the redemption of your shares would be considered “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” and thus would result in gain or loss to you however whether a distribution is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” depends on all of the facts and circumstances and if you rely on any of these tests at the time of redemption you should consult your tax advisor to determine their application to the particular situation 

 

generally if the redemption does not meet the tests described above then the proceeds received by you from the redemption of your shares will be treated as a distribution taxable as a dividend to the extent of the allocable portion of current or accumulated earnings and profits if the redemption is taxed as a dividend your adjusted tax basis in the redeemed shares will be transferred to any other shareholdings in us that you own if you own no other shareholdings in us under certain circumstances such basis may be transferred to a related person or it may be lost entirely 

 

gain from the sale or exchange of our shares held for more than one year is taxed at a maximum longterm capital gain rate which is currently 15 pursuant to internal revenue service guidance we may classify portions of our capital gain dividends as gains eligible for the longterm capital gains rate or as gain taxable to individual stockholders at a maximum rate of 25 

 

treatment of taxexempt us stockholders taxexempt entities including qualified employee pension and profit sharing trusts and individual retirement accounts “exempt organizations” generally are exempt from federal income taxation however they are subject to taxation on their unrelated business taxable income “ubti” the internal revenue service has issued a published revenue ruling that dividend distributions from a reit to an exempt employee pension trust do not constitute ubti provided that the shares of the reit are not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business of the exempt employee pension trust based on this ruling amounts distributed by us to exempt organizations generally should not constitute ubti however if an exempt organization finances its acquisition of the shares of our stock with debt a portion of its income from us will constitute ubti pursuant to the 

“debt financed property” rules likewise a portion of the exempt organization’s income from us would constitute ubti if we held a residual interest in a real estate mortgage investment conduit 

 

in addition in certain circumstances a pension trust that owns more than 10 of our stock is required to treat a percentage of our dividends as ubti this rule applies to a pension trust holding more than 10 of our stock only if 1 the percentage of our income that is ubti determined as if we were a pension trust is at least 5 2 we qualify as a reit by reason of the modification of the five or fewer requirement that allows beneficiaries of the pension trust to be treated as holding shares in proportion to their actuarial interests in the pension trust and 3 either i one pension trust owns more than 25 of the value of our stock or ii a group of pension trusts individually holding more than 10 of the value of our stock collectively own more than 50 of the value of our stock 

 

backup withholding and information reporting under certain circumstances you may be subject to backup withholding at applicable rates on payments made with respect to or cash proceeds of a sale or exchange of shares of our stock backup withholding will apply only if you 1 fail to provide a correct taxpayer identification number which if you are an individual is ordinarily your social security number 2 furnish an incorrect taxpayer identification number 3 are notified by the internal revenue service that you have failed to properly report payments of interest or dividends or 4 fail to certify under penalties of perjury that you have furnished a correct taxpayer identification number and that the internal revenue service has not notified you that you are subject to backup withholding 

 

backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients such as corporations and taxexempt organizations you should consult with a tax advisor regarding qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining an exemption backup withholding is not an additional tax rather the amount of any backup withholding with respect to payment to a stockholder will be allowed as a credit against such stockholder’s united states federal income tax liability and may entitle such stockholder to a refund provided that the required information is provided to the internal revenue service in addition withholding a portion of capital gain distributions made to stockholders may be required for stockholders who fail to certify their nonforeign status 

 

taxation of foreign stockholders the following summary applies to you only if you are a foreign person the federal taxation of foreign persons is a highly complex matter that may be affected by many considerations 

 

except as discussed below distributions to you of cash generated by our real estate operations in the form of ordinary dividends but not by the sale or exchange of our capital assets generally will be subject to us withholding tax at a rate of 30 unless an applicable tax treaty reduces that tax and you file with us the required form evidencing the lower rate 

 

in general you will be subject to united states federal income tax on a graduated rate basis rather than withholding with respect to your investment in our stock if such investment is “effectively connected” with your conduct of a trade or business in the united states a corporate foreign stockholder that receives income that is or is treated as effectively connected with a united states trade or business may also be subject to the branch profits tax which is payable in addition to regular united states corporate income tax the following discussion will apply to foreign stockholders whose investment in us is not so effectively connected we expect to withhold united states income tax as described below on the gross amount of any distributions paid to you unless 1 you file an internal revenue service form w8eci with us claiming that the distribution is “effectively connected” or 2 certain other exceptions apply 

 

distributions by us that are attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a united states real property interest will be taxed to you under the foreign investment in real property tax act of 1980 “firpta” as if these distributions were gains “effectively connected” with a united states trade or business accordingly you will be taxed at the normal capital gain rates applicable to a us stockholder on these amounts subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals distributions subject to firpta may also be subject to a branch profits tax in the hands of a corporate foreign stockholder that is not entitled to treaty exemption 

we will be required to withhold from distributions subject to firpta and remit to the internal revenue service 35 of designated capital gain dividends or if greater 35 of the amount of any distributions that could be designated as capital gain dividends in addition if we designate prior distributions as capital gain dividends subsequent distributions up to the amount of the prior distributions not withheld against will be treated as capital gain dividends for purposes of withholding 

 

for taxable years beginning after october 22 2004 any capital gain dividend with respect to any class of stock that is “regularly traded” on an established securities market will be treated as an ordinary dividend if the foreign stockholder did not own more than 5 of such class of stock at any time during the taxable year once this provision takes effect foreign stockholders generally will not be required to report distributions received from us on us federal income tax returns and all distributions treated as dividends for us federal income tax purposes including any capital gain dividend will be subject to a 30 us withholding tax unless reduced under an applicable income tax treaty as discussed above in addition the branch profits tax will no longer apply to such distributions 

 

unless our shares constitute a “united states real property interest” within the meaning of firpta or are effectively connected with a us trade or business a sale of our shares by you generally will not be subject to united states taxation our shares will not constitute a united states real property interest if we qualify as a “domestically controlled reit” we do and expect to continue to qualify as a domestically controlled reit a domestically controlled reit is a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50 in value of its shares is held directly or indirectly by foreign stockholders however if you are a nonresident alien individual who is present in the united states for 183 days or more during the taxable year and certain other conditions apply you will be subject to a 30 tax on such capital gains in any event a purchaser of our shares from you will not be required under firpta to withhold on the purchase price if the purchased shares are “regularly traded” on an established securities market or if we are a domestically controlled reit otherwise under firpta the purchaser may be required to withhold 10 of the purchase price and remit such amount to the internal revenue service 

 

backup withholding tax and information reporting will generally not apply to distributions paid to you outside the united states that are treated as 1 dividends to which the 30 or lower treaty rate withholding tax discussed above applies 2 capital gains dividends or 3 distributions attributable to gain from the sale or exchange by us of us real property interests payment of the proceeds of a sale of stock within the united states or conducted through certain us related financial intermediaries is subject to both backup withholding and information reporting unless the beneficial owner certifies under penalties of perjury that he or she is not a us person and the payor does not have actual knowledge that the beneficial owner is a us person or otherwise established an exemption you may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for refund with the internal revenue service

our facility operators’ revenues are primarily driven by occupancy medicare and medicaid reimbursement if applicable and private pay rates expenses for these facilities are primarily driven by the costs of labor food utilities taxes insurance and rent or debt service revenues from government reimbursement have and may continue to come under pressure due to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls liability insurance and staffing costs continue to increase for our operators to the extent that any decrease in revenues andor any increase in operating expenses result in a facility not generating enough cash to make payments to us the credit of our operator and the value of other collateral would have to be relied upon

we are exposed to the risk that our operators may not be able to meet the rent principal and interest or other payments due us which may result in an operator bankruptcy or insolvency or that an operator might become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings for other reasons although our operating lease agreements provide us with the right to evict an operator demand immediate payment of rent and exercise other remedies and our loans provide us with the right to terminate any funding obligation demand immediate repayment of principal and unpaid interest foreclose on the collateral and exercise other remedies the bankruptcy laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization an operator in bankruptcy may be able to limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent in the case of a lease or to receive unpaid principal and interest in the case of a loan and to exercise other rights and remedies 

 

we may be required to fund certain expenses eg real estate taxes and maintenance to preserve the value of a facility avoid the imposition of liens on a facility andor transition a facility to a new operator in some instances we have terminated our lease with an operator and relet the facility to another operator in some of those situations we have provided working capital loans to and limited indemnification of the new operator if we cannot transition a leased facility to a new operator we may take possession of that facility which may expose us to certain successor liabilities should such events occur our revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely affected 

 

risk factors related to government regulations 

 

our operators’ businesses are affected by government reimbursement and private payor rates to the extent that a facility receives a significant portion of its revenues from governmental payors primarily medicare and medicaid such revenues may be subject to statutory and regulatory changes retroactive rate adjustments recovery of program overpayments or setoffs administrative rulings policy interpretations payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries government funding restrictions at a program level or with respect to specific facilities and interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing governmental investigations and audits at such facility in recent years governmental payors have frozen or reduced payments to health care providers due to budgetary pressures health care reimbursement will likely continue to be of paramount importance to federal and state authorities we cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or effect any future legislative reforms may have on the financial condition of the skilled nursing industry the specialty care industry or the health care industry in general there can be no assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will continue to be available for services provided by any facility operator whether the facility receives reimbursement from medicare medicaid or private payors significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on an operator’s liquidity financial condition and results of operations which could adversely affect the ability of an operator to meet its obligations to us in addition the replacement of an operator that has defaulted on its lease or loan could be delayed by the approval process of any federal state or local agency necessary for the transfer of the facility or the replacement of the operator licensed to manage the facility see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — reimbursement” above 

 

risk factors related to liability claims and insurance costs 

 

longterm care facility operators skilled nursing facilities assisted living facilities and independent livingcontinuing care retirement communities have experienced substantial increases in both the number and size of patient care liability claims in recent years particularly in the states of texas and florida as a result general and professional liability costs have increased and may continue to increase longterm care liability insurance rates are increasing nationwide because of large jury awards in states like texas and florida over the past four years both texas and florida have adopted skilled nursing facility liability laws that modify or limit tort damages despite some of these reforms the longterm care industry overall continues to experience very high general and professional liability costs insurance companies have responded to this claims crisis by severely restricting their capacity to write longterm care general and professional liability policies no assurances can be given that the climate for longterm care general and professional liability insurance will improve in any of the foregoing states or any other states where the facility operators conduct business insurance companies may continue to reduce or stop writing general and professional liability policies for longterm care facilities thus general professional liability insurance coverage may be restricted or very costly which may adversely affect the facility operators’ future 

operations cash flows and financial condition and may have a material adverse effect on the facility operators’ ability to meet their obligations to us 

 

risk factors related to acquisitions 

 

we are exposed to the risk that our future acquisitions may not prove to be successful we could encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired properties including contingent liabilities and newly acquired properties might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business if we agree to provide construction funding to an operator and the project is not completed we may need to take steps to ensure completion of the project or we could lose the property moreover if we issue equity securities or incur additional debt or both to finance future acquisitions it may reduce our per share financial results these costs may negatively affect our results of operations 

 

risk factors related to environmental laws 

 

under various federal and state laws owners or operators of real estate may be required to respond to the release of hazardous substances on the property and may be held liable for property damage personal injuries or penalties that result from environmental contamination these laws also expose us to the possibility that we may become liable to reimburse the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination generally such liability attaches to a person based on the person’s relationship to the property our tenants or borrowers are primarily responsible for the condition of the property and since we are a passive landlord we do not “participate in the management” of any property in which we have an interest moreover we review environmental site assessments of the properties that we own or encumber prior to taking an interest in them those assessments are designed to meet the “all appropriate inquiry” standard which qualifies us for the innocent purchaser defense if environmental liabilities arise based upon such assessments we do not believe that any of our properties are subject to material environmental contamination however environmental liabilities may be present in our properties and we may incur costs to remediate contamination which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition 

 

risk factors related to reinvestment of sale proceeds 

 

from time to time we will have cash available from 1 the proceeds of sales of our securities 2 principal payments on our loans receivable and 3 the sale of properties including nonelective dispositions under the terms of master leases or similar financial support arrangements we must reinvest these proceeds on a timely basis in properties or in qualified shortterm investments we compete for real estate investments with a broad variety of potential investors this competition for attractive investments may negatively affect our ability to make timely investments on terms acceptable to us delays in acquiring properties may negatively impact revenues and perhaps our ability to make distributions to stockholders 

 

other risk factors 

 

we are also subject to a number of other risks first we might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a reit we intend to operate as a reit under the internal revenue code and believe we have and will continue to operate in such a manner since reit qualification requires us to meet a number of complex requirements it is possible that we may fail to fulfill them and if we do our earnings will be reduced by the amount of federal taxes owed a reduction in our earnings would affect the amount we could distribute to our stockholders also if we were not a reit we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders since a nonreit is not required to pay dividends to stockholders amounting to at least 90 of its annual taxable income including 100 of capital gains see “item 1 — business — taxation” for a discussion of the provisions of the internal revenue code that apply to us and the effects of nonqualification 

 

second our second restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain antitakeover provisions staggered board provisions restrictions on share ownership and transfer and super majority stockholder approval requirements for business combinations that could make it more difficult for or even prevent 

a third party from acquiring us without the approval of our incumbent board of directors provisions and agreements that inhibit or discourage takeover attempts could reduce the market value of our common stock 

 

third we are dependent on key personnel although we have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers losing any one of them could at least temporarily have an adverse impact on our operations we believe that losing more than one would have a material adverse impact on our business

the following discussion and analysis is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of health care reit inc for the periods presented and should be read together with the notes thereto contained in this annual report on form 10k other important factors are identified in “item 1 — business” and “item 1a — risk factors” above 

 

executive overview 

 

business 

 

health care reit inc is a selfadministered equity real estate investment trust that invests in health care and senior housing properties founded in 1970 we were the first reit to invest exclusively in health care facilities the following table summarizes our portfolio as of december 31 2005 

 

 

 

 

  

our primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and enhance stockholder value we seek to pay consistent cash dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual increases in rental and interest income and portfolio growth to meet these objectives we invest in properties managed by experienced operators and diversify our investment portfolio by operator and geographic location 

 

substantially all of our revenues and sources of cash flows from operations are derived from operating lease rentals and interest earned on outstanding loans receivable these items represent our primary source of liquidity to fund distributions and are dependent upon our operators’ continued ability to make contractual rent and interest payments to us to the extent that our operators experience operating difficulties and are unable to generate sufficient cash to make payments to us there could be a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity andor financial condition to mitigate this risk we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of facility and operator our asset management process includes review of monthly financial statements for each facility periodic review of operator credit periodic facility inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure real estate taxes letters of credit and other collateral in monitoring our portfolio our personnel use a proprietary database to collect and analyze facilityspecific data additionally we conduct extensive research to ascertain industry trends and risks through these asset management and research efforts we are typically able to intervene at an early stage to address payment risk and in so doing support both the collectibility of revenue and the value of our investment 

 

in addition to our asset management and research efforts we also structure our investments to help mitigate payment risk we typically limit our investments to no more than 90 of the appraised value of a property operating leases and loans are normally credit enhanced by guaranties andor letters of credit in addition operating leases are typically structured as master leases and loans are generally crossdefaulted and crosscollateralized with 

other loans operating leases or agreements between us and the operator and its affiliates as of december 31 2005 87 of our real property was subject to master leases 

 

for the year ended december 31 2005 rental income and interest income represented 90 and 8 respectively of total gross revenues including discontinued operations prior to june 2004 our standard lease structure contained fixed annual rental escalators which were generally recognized on a straightline basis over the initial lease period beginning in june 2004 our new standard lease structure contains annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the consumer price index andor changes in the gross operating revenues of the tenant’s properties these escalators are not fixed so no straightline rent is recorded however rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period this lease structure initially generates lower revenues and earnings compared to leases with fixed escalators that require straightlining but enables us to generate additional organic growth and minimize noncash straightline rent over time this change does not affect our cash flow or our ability to pay dividends our yield on loans receivable depends upon a number of factors including the stated interest rate the average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments 

 

depending upon the availability and cost of external capital we anticipate making investments in additional facilities new investments are generally funded from temporary borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements internally generated cash and the proceeds from sales of real property our investments generate internal cash from rent and interest receipts and principal payments on loans receivable permanent financing for future investments which replaces funds drawn under the unsecured lines of credit arrangements is expected to be provided through a combination of public and private offerings of debt and equity securities and the incurrence of secured debt we believe our liquidity and various sources of available capital are sufficient to fund operations meet debt service obligations both principal and interest make dividend distributions and finance future investments 

 

depending upon market conditions we believe that new investments will be available in the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to our stockholders we expect to complete gross new investments of 450000000 to 550000000 in 2006 including acquisitions of 300000000 and funded new development of 150000000 to 250000000 we anticipate the sale of real property and the repayment of loans receivable totaling approximately 100000000 to 150000000 during 2006 it is possible that additional loan repayments or sales of real property may occur in the future to the extent that loan repayments and real property sales exceed new investments our revenues and cash flows from operations could be adversely affected we expect to reinvest the proceeds from any loan repayments and real property sales in new investments to the extent that new investment requirements exceed our available cash onhand we expect to borrow under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements at december 31 2005 we had 36237000 of cash and cash equivalents and 345000000 of available borrowing capacity under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements 

key transactions in 2005 

 

we completed the following key transactions during the year ended december 31 2005 

 

  

key performance indicators trends and uncertainties 

 

we utilize several key performance indicators to evaluate the various aspects of our business these indicators are discussed below and relate to operating performance credit strength and concentration risk management uses these key performance indicators to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results in making operating decisions and for budget planning purposes 

 

operating performance we believe that net income available to common stockholders “nics” is the most appropriate earnings measure other useful supplemental measures of our operating performance include funds from operations “ffo” and funds available for distribution “fad” however these supplemental measures are not defined by us generally accepted accounting principals “us gaap” please refer to the section entitled “nongaap financial measures” for further discussion of ffo and fad and for reconciliations of ffo and fad to nics these earning measures and their relative per share amounts are widely used by investors and analysts in the valuation comparison and investment recommendations of companies the following table reflects the recent historical trends of our operating performance measures in thousands except per share data 

 

 

credit strength we measure our credit strength both in terms of leverage ratios and coverage ratios our leverage ratios include debt to book capitalization and debt to market capitalization the leverage ratios indicate how much of our balance sheet capitalization is related to longterm debt our coverage ratios include interest coverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio the coverage ratios indicate our ability to service interest and fixed charges interest plus preferred dividends we expect to maintain capitalization ratios and coverage ratios sufficient to maintain investment grade ratings with moody’s investors service standard  poor’s ratings services and fitch ratings the coverage ratios are based on earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” which is discussed in further detail and reconciled to net income below in “nongaap financial measures” leverage ratios and coverage ratios are widely used by investors analysts and rating agencies in the valuation comparison investment recommendations and rating of companies the following table reflects the recent historical trends for our credit strength measures 

 

 

 

concentration risk we evaluate our concentration risk in terms of asset mix investment mix operator mix and geographic mix concentration risk is a valuable measure in understanding what portion of our investments could be at risk if certain sectors were to experience downturns asset mix measures the portion of our investments that are real property in order to qualify as an equity reit at least 75 of our real estate investments must be real property whereby each property which includes the land buildings improvements and related rights is owned by us and leased to an operator pursuant to a longterm operating lease investment mix measures the portion of our investments that relate to our various facility types operator mix measures the portion of our investments that relate to our top five operators the following table reflects our recent historical trends of concentration risk 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

we evaluate our key performance indicators in conjunction with current expectations to determine if historical trends are indicative of future results our expected results may not be achieved and actual results may differ materially from our expectations management regularly monitors various economic and other factors to develop strategic and tactical plans designed to improve performance and maximize our competitive position our ability to achieve our financial objectives is dependent upon our ability to effectively execute these plans and to appropriately respond to emerging economic and companyspecific trends please refer to “item 1a — risk factors” above for further discussion 

 

portfolio update 

 

payment coverages in our portfolio continue to improve our overall payment coverage is at 192 times and represents an increase of 14 basis points from 2004 and 39 basis points from 2003 the following table reflects our recent historical trends of portfolio coverages coverage data reflects the 12 months ended for the periods presented cbmf represents the ratio of facilities’ earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and management fees to contractual rent or interest due us camf represents the ratio of earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and rent but after management fees to contractual rent or interest due us

liquidity and capital resources 

 

sources and uses of cash 

 

our primary sources of cash include rent and interest receipts borrowings under unsecured lines of credit arrangements public and private offerings of debt and equity securities proceeds from the sales of real property and principal payments on loans receivable our primary uses of cash include dividend distributions debt service payments including principal and interest real property acquisitions loan advances and general and administrative expenses these sources and uses of cash are reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows and are discussed in further detail below 

 

the following is a summary of our sources and uses of cash flows dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

operating activities the increases in net cash provided from operating activities are primarily attributable to increases in net income excluding the provision for depreciation and net straightline rental income net income and the provision for depreciation increased primarily as a result of net new investments in properties owned by us see the discussion of investing activities below for additional details to the extent that we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future our net income and provision for depreciation will change accordingly net straightline rental income decreased primarily due to a decrease in gross straightline rental income and increases in cash payments outside normal monthly rental payments 

 

the following is a summary of our straightline rent dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

gross straightline rental income represents the noncash difference between contractual cash rent due and the average rent recognized pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 13 “accounting for leases” this amount is positive in the first half of a lease term but declining every year due to annual increases in cash rent due and is negative in the second half of a lease term the decrease in gross straightline rental income is primarily due to annual increases in cash rent due on leases with fixed increases and our decision in 2004 to change our 

standard lease structure prior to june 2004 our standard lease structure contained fixed annual rental escalators which were generally recognized on a straightline basis over the initial lease period beginning in june 2004 our new standard lease structure contains annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the consumer price index andor changes in the gross operating revenues of the tenant’s properties these escalators are not fixed so no straightline rent is recorded instead rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payment due for the period the increase in nonrecurring cash receipts are primarily attributable to cash received in connection with real property sales that resulted in the payoff of existing straightline receivable balances 

 

investing activities the changes in net cash used in investing activities are primarily attributable to net changes in loans receivable and real property investments the following is a summary of our investment and disposition activities dollars in thousands 

 

 

financing activities the changes in net cash provided from or used in financing activities are primarily attributable to changes related to our longterm debt common stock issuances preferred stock issuances and redemptions and cash distributions to stockholders 

 

the following is a summary our senior unsecured note issuances dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

we repaid 40000000 of 80 senior unsecured notes upon maturity in april 2004 in may 2005 we redeemed all of our outstanding 50000000 817 senior unsecured notes due march 2006 we completed a public tender offer for 57670000 of our outstanding 100000000 7625 senior unsecured notes due march 2008 and we redeemed 122500000 of our outstanding 175000000 75 senior unsecured notes due august 2007 the increase in principal payments on secured debt during 2005 is primarily due to early extinguishments of outstanding mortgages during the year ended december 31 2005 we paid off mortgages with outstanding balances of 72309000 and average interest rates of 7481 

 

the change in common stock is primarily attributable to public and private issuances and common stock issuances related to our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan “drip” the remaining difference in common stock issuances is primarily due to issuances pursuant to stock incentive plans 

 

the following is a summary our common stock issuances dollars in thousands except per share amounts 

 

 

 

in july 2003 we closed on a public offering of 4000000 shares of 7875 series d cumulative redeemable preferred stock which generated net proceeds of approximately 96850000 a portion of the proceeds from this offering were used to redeem all 3000000 shares of our 8875 series b cumulative redeemable preferred stock on july 15 2003 at a redemption price of 25 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends in september 2004 we closed on a public offering of 7000000 shares of 7625 series f cumulative redeemable preferred stock which generated net proceeds of approximately 169107000 the proceeds were used to repay borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements and to invest in additional properties 

 

in order to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we must distribute at least 90 of our taxable income including 100 of capital gains to our stockholders the increases in dividends are primarily attributable to increases in outstanding common and preferred stock shares as discussed above and increases in our annual common stock dividend per share 

the following is a summary of our dividend payments in thousands except per share amounts 

 

 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we have an outstanding letter of credit issued for the benefit of certain insurance companies that provide workers’ compensation insurance to one of our tenants our obligation under the letter of credit matures in 2009 at december 31 2005 our obligation under the letter of credit was 2450000 

 

we are exposed to various market risks including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates we may or may not elect to use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate exposure these decisions are principally based on the general trend in interest rates at the applicable dates our perception of the future volatility of interest rates and our relative levels of variable rate debt and variable rate investments as of december 31 2005 we participated in two interest rate swap agreements related to our longterm debt our interest rate swaps are discussed below in “contractual obligations” 

 

contractual obligations 

 

the following table summarizes our payment requirements under contractual obligations as of december 31 2005 in thousands 

 

 

 

 

  

we have an unsecured credit arrangement with a consortium of ten banks providing for a revolving line of credit “revolving credit” in the amount of 500000000 which expires on june 22 2008 with the ability to extend for one year at our discretion if we are in compliance with all covenants the agreement specifies that borrowings under the revolving credit are subject to interest payable in periods no longer than three months at either the agent bank’s prime rate of interest or the applicable margin over libor interest rate at our option 5387 at december 31 2005 the applicable margin is based on our ratings with moody’s investors service and standard  poor’s ratings services and was 09 at december 31 2005 in addition we pay a facility fee annually to each bank based on the bank’s commitment under the revolving credit facility the facility fee depends on our ratings

at december 31 2005 we had operating lease obligations of 14257000 relating to our office space five assisted living facilities and three skilled nursing facilities 

 

purchase obligations are comprised of unfunded construction commitments and contingent purchase obligations at december 31 2005 we had outstanding construction financings of 3906000 for leased properties and were committed to providing additional financing of approximately 36519000 to complete construction at december 31 2005 we had contingent purchase obligations totaling 44930000 these contingent purchase obligations primarily relate to deferred acquisition fundings and capital improvements deferred acquisition fundings are contingent upon a tenant satisfying certain conditions in the lease upon funding amounts due from the tenant are increased to reflect the additional investment in the property 

 

capital structure 

 

as of december 31 2005 we had stockholders’ equity of 1430756000 and a total outstanding debt balance of 1500818000 which represents a debt to total book capitalization ratio of 51 our ratio of debt to market capitalization was 40 at december 31 2005 for the year ended december 31 2005 our coverage ratio of ebitda to interest was 310 to 100 for the year ended december 31 2005 our coverage ratio of ebitda to fixed charges was 247 to 100 also at december 31 2005 we had 36237000 of cash and cash equivalents and 345000000 of available borrowing capacity under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements 

 

our debt agreements contain various covenants restrictions and events of default among other things these provisions require us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness create liens and make investments or acquisitions as of december 31 2005 we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our debt agreements none of our debt agreements contain provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by our debt ratings however under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements the ratings on our senior unsecured notes are used to determine the fees and interest payable 

 

our senior unsecured notes are rated baa3 stable bbb positive and bbb stable by moody’s investors service standard  poor’s ratings services and fitch ratings respectively we plan to manage the company to maintain investment grade status with a capital structure consistent with our current profile any downgrades in 

terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the noted rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity andor financial condition 

 

as of february 28 2006 we had an effective shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission under which we may issue up to 429344619 of securities including debt securities common and preferred stock depositary shares warrants and units also as of february 28 2006 we had an effective registration statement on file in connection with our enhanced drip program under which we may issue up to 6314213 shares of common stock as of february 28 2006 2718433 shares of common stock remained available for issuance under this registration statement depending upon market conditions we anticipate issuing securities under our registration statements to invest in additional properties and to repay borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements 

 

results of operations 

 

 

 

net income available to common stockholders decreased 14 from 2004 and 11 from 2003 primarily due to the losses on extinguishment of debt totaling 21484000 or 039 per diluted share and increases in interest expense provision for depreciation and preferred stock dividends offset by increases in rental income net income available to common stockholders increased 3 from 2003 to 2004 due to an increase in rental income offset by increases in interest expense and provision for depreciation these changes are discussed in further detail below net income available to common stockholders decreased on a per share basis during 2005 due to the lower net income available to common stockholders discussed above and higher outstanding shares net income available to common stockholders decreased on a per share basis during 2004 primarily due to higher outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis average common shares outstanding for the year ended december 31 2005 was 54499000 a 5 increase from 52082000 for the same period in 2004 and an 18 increase from 44201000 for the same period in 2003 the increase in fully diluted average common shares outstanding is primarily the result of public and private common stock offerings and common stock issuances pursuant to our drip

the decrease in ffo for the year ended december 31 2005 is primarily due to the losses on extinguishment of debt the increase in ffo for the year ended december 31 2004 is primarily due to the increase in net income available to common stockholders the increases in fad are primarily due to the changes in net straightline rental income offset by the losses on extinguishment of debt please refer to the discussion of “nongaap financial measures” below for further information regarding ffo and fad and for reconciliations of ffo and fad to nics 

the increases in ebitda are primarily due to increases in net income excluding interest expense and provision for depreciation our coverage ratio of ebitda to total interest was 310 times for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared with 324 times for the same period in 2004 and 350 times for the same period in 2003 our coverage ratio of ebitda to fixed charges was 247 times for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared with 277 times for the same period in 2004 and 301 times for the same period in 2003 our coverage ratios declined from the prior years primarily due to the losses on extinguishment of debt and increases in interest expense please refer to the discussion of “nongaap financial measures” below for further information regarding ebitda and a reconciliation of ebitda and net income 

 

revenues were comprised of the following dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

the increase in gross revenues is primarily attributable to increased rental income resulting from the acquisitions of new properties from which we receive rent see the discussion of investing activities in “liquidity and capital resources” above for further information in addition as discussed above prior to june 2004 our standard lease structure contained fixed annual rental escalators which were generally recognized on a straightline basis over the minimum lease period beginning in june 2004 our new standard lease structure contains annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the consumer price index andor changes in the gross operating revenues of the tenant’s properties these escalators are not fixed so no straightline rent is recorded however rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period while this change does not affect our cash flow or our ability to pay dividends it is anticipated that we will generate additional organic growth and minimize noncash straightline rent over time if gross operating revenues at our facilities andor the consumer price index do not increase a portion of our revenues may not continue to increase sales of real property would offset revenue increases and to the extent that they exceed new acquisitions could result in decreased revenues our leases could renew above or below current rent rates resulting in an increase or decrease in rental income as of december 31 2005 we had no leases expiring prior to 2009 with the exception of our master lease with commonwealth communities holdings llc in october 2005 kindred healthcare inc “kindred” announced its intent to acquire commonwealth as part of this transaction which closed on february 28 2006 we leased the commonwealth facilities to kindred under two master leases 

 

interest income increased in 2005 primarily due to recognition of additional interest income of approximately 4509000 offset by loan payoffs the additional interest income related to the payoffs of loans that were either on nonaccrual or partial accrual and all contractual interest was received from the borrowers transaction fees and other income fluctuated primarily due to 822000 of extinguishment recoveries 750000 in termination fees as well as additional fees from loan payoffs recognized during the year ended december 31 2005 the decrease from 2003 to 2004 is primarily due to the 902000 gain from the sale of our investment in atlantic healthcare finance lp in october 2003 

expenses were comprised of the following dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

the increase in total expenses is primarily attributable to increases in interest expense the provision for depreciation and the recognition of losses on extinguishment of debt the increases in interest expense are primarily due to higher average borrowings and changes in the amount of capitalized interest offsetting interest expense this was partially offset by lower average interest rates and savings generated from interest rate swap agreements if we borrow under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements issue additional senior unsecured notes or assume additional secured debt our interest expense will increase 

 

the following is a summary of our interest expense dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

the increase in interest expense on senior unsecured notes is due to the net effect and timing of issuances and extinguishments see the discussion of financing activities in “liquidity and capital resources” above for further information 

 

the following is a summary of our senior unsecured notes principal activity dollars in thousands 

 

 

the increase in interest expense on secured debt is due to the net effect and timing of assumptions extinguishments and principal amortizations the following is a summary of our secured debt activity dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

the increase in interest expense on unsecured lines of credit arrangements is due primarily to higher average outstanding borrowings the following is a summary of our unsecured lines of credit arrangements dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

we capitalize certain interest costs associated with funds used to finance the construction of properties owned directly by us the amount capitalized is based upon the borrowings outstanding during the construction period using the rate of interest that approximates our cost of financing our interest expense is reduced by the amount capitalized capitalized interest for the years ended december 31 2003 2004 and 2005 totaled 1535000 875000 and 665000 respectively 

 

on may 6 2004 we entered into two interest rate swap agreements the “swaps” for a total notional amount of 100000000 to hedge changes in fair value attributable to changes in the libor swap rate of 100000000 of fixed rate debt with a maturity date of november 15 2013 we receive a fixed rate of 60 and pay a variable rate based on sixmonth libor plus a spread for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 we generated 972000 and 1770000 respectively of savings related to our swaps that was recorded as a reduction of interest expense we had no interest rate swap agreements outstanding during 2003 

 

the provision for depreciation increased primarily as a result of additional investments in properties owned directly by us see the discussion of investing activities in “liquidity and capital resources” above for further information to the extent that we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future our provision for depreciation will change accordingly 

 

general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues including revenues from discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2005 were 589 as compared with 654 and 555 for the same periods in 2004 and 2003 respectively the change from 2004 to 2005 is due to increased costs to attract and retain appropriate personnel to achieve our business objectives offset by a decrease in professional service fees and other operating costs as a result of focused expense control approximately onehalf of the increases from 2003 to 2004 were related to costs associated with our initiatives to attract and retain appropriate personnel to achieve our business objectives the remainder was comprised of increases relating to professional services fees including costs associated with sox compliance taxes and transition costs associated with the removal of an underperforming operator in december 2004 

the change in loan expense was primarily due to increased costs in 2003 and 2004 related to amending our primary unsecured line of credit arrangement costs related to obtaining consents to modify the covenants under our senior unsecured notes and costs related to the issuance of senior unsecured notes 

 

during the year ended december 31 2004 it was determined that the projected undiscounted cash flows from a property did not exceed its related net book value and an impairment charge of 314000 was recorded to reduce the property to its estimated fair market value the estimated fair market value of the property was determined by an independent appraisal during the year ended december 31 2003 it was determined that the projected undiscounted cash flows from a property did not exceed its related net book value and an impairment charge of 2792000 was recorded to reduce the property to its estimated fair market value the estimated fair market value of the property was determined by an independent appraisal 

 

the provision for loan losses is related to our critical accounting estimate for the allowance for loan losses and is discussed below in “critical accounting policies” 

 

other items were comprised of the following dollars in thousands 

 

 

 

one assisted living facility was held for sale at december 31 2005 we did not recognize an impairment loss on this asset as the fair market value less estimated costs to sell exceeded our carrying value also during the years ended december 31 2003 2004 and 2005 we sold properties with carrying values of 61316000 37710000 and 88098000 for net gains of 4139000 net losses of 143000 and net gains of 3227000 respectively in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 144 we have reclassified the income and expenses attributable to the properties held for sale or sold subsequent to january 1 2002 to discontinued operations these properties generated 6822000 3415000 and 1905000 of income after deducting depreciation and interest expense from rental revenue for the years ended december 31 2003 2004 and 2005 respectively please refer to note 15 of our audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

 

the increase in preferred dividends is primarily due to the increase in average outstanding preferred shares the following is a summary of our preferred stock activity 

 

 

 

in july 2003 we closed a public offering of 4000000 shares of 7875 series d cumulative redeemable preferred stock a portion of the proceeds from this offering were used to redeem all 3000000 shares of our 8875 series b cumulative redeemable preferred stock on july 15 2003 in accordance with emerging issues task force “eitf” topic d42 the costs to issue these securities were recorded as a noncash nonrecurring 

charge of 2790000 or 006 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2003 to reduce net income available to common stockholders no such transactions or charges occurred in 2004 or 2005 

 

nongaap financial measures 

 

we believe that net income as defined by us gaap is the most appropriate earnings measurement however we consider ffo and fad to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with us gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation however since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient in response the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” created ffo as a supplemental measure of operating performance for reits that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income ffo as defined by nareit means net income computed in accordance with us gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures fad represents ffo excluding the noncash straightline rental adjustments additionally our historical results include an adjustment for a preferred stock redemption charge for the year ended december 31 2003 but exclude adjustments for impairment charges 

 

in april 2002 the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 145 that requires gains and losses on extinguishment of debt to be classified as income or loss from continuing operations rather than as extraordinary items as previously required under statement no 4 we adopted the standard effective january 1 2003 and have properly reflected the 21484000 or 039 per diluted share of losses on extinguishment of debt for the year ended december 31 2005 these charges have not been added back for the calculations of ffo fad or ebitda 

 

in august 2003 we adopted the sec clarification of eitf topic d42 to implement the clarified accounting pronouncement our 2003 results reflect a reduction in net income available to common stockholders resulting from a noncash nonrecurring charge of 2790000 or 006 per diluted share due to the redemption of our 8875 series b cumulative redeemable preferred stock in july 2003 nareit has issued its recommendation that preferred stock redemption charges should not be added back to net income in the calculation of ffo and fad although we have adopted this recommendation we have also disclosed ffo and fad adjusted for the preferred stock redemption charge for enhanced clarity additionally we believe that the nature of the charge is nonrecurring because there was not a similar charge during the two preceding years and we do not anticipate a similar charge in the succeeding two years 

 

in october 2003 nareit informed its member companies that the sec had changed its position on certain aspects of the nareit ffo definition including impairment charges previously the sec accepted nareit’s view that impairment charges were effectively an early recognition of an expected loss on an impending sale of property and thus should be added back to net income in the calculation of ffo and fad similar to other gains and losses on sales however the sec’s clarified interpretation is that recurring impairments taken on real property may not be added back to net income in the calculation of ffo and fad we have adopted this interpretation and have not added back impairment charges of 2792000 or 006 per diluted share recorded for the year ended december 31 2003 and 314000 or 001 per diluted share recorded for the year ended december 31 2004 

 

ebitda stands for earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization additionally we exclude the noncash provision for loan losses in calculating ebitda we believe that ebitda along with net income and cash flow provided from operating activities is an important supplemental measure because it provides additional information to assess and evaluate the performance of our operations additionally restrictive covenants in our longterm debt arrangements contain financial ratios based on ebitda we primarily utilize ebitda to measure our interest coverage ratio which represents ebitda divided by total interest and our fixed charge coverage ratio which represents ebitda divided by fixed charges fixed charges include total interest and preferred dividends 

 

ffo fad and ebitda are financial measures that are widely used by investors equity and debt analysts and rating agencies in the valuation comparison investment recommendations and rating of companies management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results in 

making operating decisions and for budget planning purposes additionally ffo and fad are internal evaluation metrics utilized by the board of directors to evaluate management ffo fad and ebitda do not represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with us gaap and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity finally ffo fad and ebitda as defined by us may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies 

 

the table below reflects the reconciliation of ffo to net income available to common stockholders the most directly comparable us gaap measure for the periods presented the provision for depreciation includes provision for depreciation from discontinued operations amounts are in thousands except for per share data 

 

 

the table below reflects the reconciliation of fad to net income available to common stockholders the most directly comparable us gaap measure for the periods presented the provision for depreciation includes provision for depreciation from discontinued operations amounts are in thousands except for per share data 

 

 

the table below reflects the reconciliation of ebitda to net income the most directly comparable us gaap measure for the periods presented the provision for depreciation and interest expense includes provision for depreciation and interest expense from discontinued operations amortization includes amortization of deferred loan expenses restricted stock and stock options dollars are in thousands 

 

 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap which requires us to make estimates and assumptions management considers an accounting estimate or assumption critical if 

 

  

management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate and are not reasonably likely to change in the future however since these estimates require assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made they bear the risk of change if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations liquidity andor financial condition please refer to note 1 of our audited consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact us there were no material changes to these policies in 2005 

 

we adopted the fair valuebased method of accounting for sharebased payments effective january 1 2003 using the prospective method described in fasb statement no 148 accounting for stockbased compensation — 

transition and disclosure because statement 123r must be applied not only to new awards but to previously granted awards that are not fully vested on the effective date of statement 123r and because we adopted statement 123 using the prospective transition method which applied only to awards granted modified or settled after the adoption date of statement 123 compensation cost for some previously granted awards that were not recognized under statement 123 will be recognized under statement 123r additionally we amortize compensation cost for share based payments to the date that the awards become fully vested or to the expected retirement date if sooner effective with the adoption of statement 123r on january 1 2006 we will begin recognizing compensation cost to the date the awards become fully vested or to the retirement eligible date if sooner had we adopted statement 123r in prior periods the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note 9 to our audited consolidated financial statements we expect that the adoption of statement 123r will increase compensation cost by approximately 1287000 for 2006 as a result of amortizing share based awards to the retirement eligible date 

 

the following table presents information about our critical accounting policies as well as the material assumptions used to develop each estimate

impact of inflation 

 

during the past three years inflation has not significantly affected our earnings because of the moderate inflation rate additionally our earnings are primarily longterm investments with fixed rates of return these investments are mainly financed with a combination of equity senior unsecured notes and borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements during inflationary periods which generally are accompanied by rising interest rates our ability to grow may be adversely affected because the yield on new investments may increase at a slower rate than new borrowing costs presuming the current inflation rate remains moderate and longterm interest rates do not increase significantly we believe that inflation will not impact the availability of equity and debt financing for us

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

we are exposed to various market risks including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates we seek to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates by matching the terms of new investments with new longterm fixed rate borrowings to the extent possible we may or may not elect to use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate exposure these decisions are principally based on our policy to match our variable rate investments with comparable borrowings but are also based on the general trend in interest rates at the applicable dates and our perception of the future volatility of interest rates the following section is presented to provide a discussion of the risks associated with potential fluctuations in interest rates 

 

we historically borrow on our unsecured lines of credit arrangements to acquire construct or make loans relating to health care and senior housing properties then as market conditions dictate we will issue equity or longterm fixed rate debt to repay the borrowings under the unsecured lines of credit arrangements 

 

a change in interest rates will not affect the interest expense associated with our fixed rate debt interest rate changes however will affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt a 1 increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in fair value of our senior unsecured notes by approximately 36770000 at december 31 2005 28025000 at december 31 2004 changes in the interest rate environment upon maturity of this fixed rate debt could have an effect on our future cash flows and earnings depending on whether the debt is replaced with other fixed rate debt variable rate debt or equity or repaid by the sale of assets 

 

on may 6 2004 we entered into two interest rate swap agreements the “swaps” for a total notional amount of 100000000 to hedge changes in fair value attributable to changes in the libor swap rate of 100000000 of fixed rate debt with a maturity date of november 15 2013 the swaps are treated as fairvalue hedges for accounting purposes and we utilize the shortcut method in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended the swaps are with highly rated counterparties in which we receive a fixed rate of 60 and pay a variable rate based on sixmonth libor plus a spread at december 31 2005 and 2004 the swaps were reported at their fair values as a 2211000 and 4206000 other asset respectively a 1 increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in fair value of our swaps by approximately 6435000 and 7382000 at december 31 2005 and 2004 we had no interest rate swap agreements outstanding at december 31 2003 

 

our variable rate debt including our unsecured lines of credit arrangements is reflected at fair value at december 31 2005 we had 195000000 outstanding related to our variable rate debt and assuming no changes in outstanding balances a 1 increase in interest rates would result in increased annual interest expense of 1950000 at december 31 2004 we had 151000000 outstanding related to our variable rate debt and assuming no changes in outstanding balances a 1 increase in interest rates would have resulted in increased annual interest expense of 1510000 

 

we are subject to risks associated with debt financing including the risk that existing indebtedness may not be refinanced or that the terms of refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of current indebtedness the majority of our borrowings were completed under indentures or contractual agreements that limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur accordingly in the event that we are unable to raise additional equity or borrow money because of these limitations our ability to acquire additional properties may be limited

   skilled nursing facilities are licensed daily rate or rental properties where the majority of individuals require 24hour nursing andor medical care in most cases these properties are licensed for medicaid andor medicare reimbursement these facilities provide inpatient skilled nursing and personal care services as well as rehabilitative restorative and transitional medical services in some instances skilled nursing facilities supplement hospital care by providing specialized care for medically complex patients whose conditions require intense medical and therapeutic services but who are medically stable enough to have these services provided in facilities that are less expensive than acute care hospitals certain of our skilled nursing facilities include other care levels including assisted living and dementia care 

   our specialty care facilities include acute care hospitals longterm acute care hospitals and other specialty care hospitals acute care hospitals provide a wide range of inpatient and outpatient services including but not limited to surgery rehabilitation therapy and clinical laboratories longterm acute care hospitals provide inpatient services for patients with complex medical conditions that require more intensive care monitoring or emergency support than that available in most skilled nursing facilities other specialty care hospitals provide specialized inpatient and outpatient services for specific illnesses or diseases including among others orthopedic neurosurgical and behavioral care 

investments 

  we invest in health care facilities with a primary focus on longterm care facilities which include skilled nursing and assisted living facilities we also invest in specialty care facilities we diversify our investment portfolio by operator and geographic location 

  in determining whether to invest in a facility we focus on the following a the experience of the tenant’s or borrower’s management team b the historical and projected financial and operational performance of the facility c the credit of the tenant or borrower d the security for the lease or loan and e the capital committed to the facility by the tenant or borrower we conduct market research and analysis for all potential investments in addition we review the value of all facilities the interest rates and debt service coverage requirements of any debt to be assumed and the anticipated sources of repayment of any debt 

  our investments are primarily real property leased to operators under longterm operating leases and mortgage loans construction financing is provided but only as part of a longterm operating lease or mortgage loan substantially all of our investments are designed with escalating rate structures depending upon market conditions we believe that appropriate new investments will be available in the future with substantially the same spreads over our cost of capital operating leases and mortgage loans are normally credit enhanced by guaranties andor letters of credit in addition operating leases are typically structured as master leases and mortgage loans are generally crossdefaulted and crosscollateralized with other mortgage loans operating leases or agreements between us and the operator and its affiliates 

  at december 31 2004 85 of our owned real property was subject to master leases a master lease is a lease of multiple facilities from us to one tenant entity under a single lease agreement from time to time we 

4 may acquire additional facilities that are then leased to the tenant under the master lease the tenant is required to make one monthly payment that represents rent on all the properties that are subject to the master lease typically the master lease tenant can exercise its right to purchase the facilities or to renew the master lease only with respect to all leased facilities at the same time this “bundling” feature benefits us because the tenant cannot limit the purchase or renewal to the better performing facilities and terminate the leasing arrangement with respect to the poorer performing facilities this spreads our risk among the entire group of facilities within the master lease the bundling feature may provide a similar advantage if the master lease tenant is in bankruptcy subject to certain restrictions a debtor in bankruptcy has the right to assume or reject each of its leases it is our intent that a tenant who is in bankruptcy would be required to assume or reject the master lease as a whole rather than making the decision on a facility by facility basis 

  we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of health care facility and operator our monitoring process includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each facility quarterly review of operator creditworthiness periodic facility inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure real estate taxes letters of credit and other collateral in monitoring our portfolio our personnel use a proprietary database to collect and analyze facilityspecific data additionally we conduct extensive research to ascertain industry trends and risks 

  through monitoring and research we evaluate the operating environment in each facility’s market to determine whether payment risk is likely to increase when we identify unacceptable levels of payment risk we seek to mitigate eliminate or transfer the risk we categorize the risk as operator facility or market risk for operator risk we typically find a substitute operator to run the facility for facility risk we usually work with the operator to institute facility level management changes to address the risk finally for market risk we often encourage an operator to change its capital structure including refinancing or raising additional equity through these monitoring and research efforts we are generally able to intervene at an early stage and address payment risk and in so doing support both the collectibility of revenue and the value of our investment 

   each facility which includes the land building improvements and related rights owned by us is leased to an operator pursuant to a longterm operating lease as discussed above most of our leased properties are subject to master leases the leases generally have a fixed term of seven to 15 years and contain one or more five to 15year renewal options each lease is a net lease requiring the tenant to pay rent and all additional charges incurred in the operation of the leased property the tenants are required to repair rebuild and maintain the leased properties 

  the net value of our completed leased properties aggregated approximately 2164964000 at december 31 2004 prior to june 2004 our standard lease structure contained fixed annual rental escalators which were generally recognized on a straightline basis over the initial lease period beginning in june 2004 our new standard lease structure contains annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the consumer price index andor changes in the gross operating revenues of the property these escalators are not fixed so no straightline rent is recorded however rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period this lease structure will initially generate lower revenues net income and funds from operations compared to leases with fixed escalators that require straightlining but will enable us to generate additional organic growth and minimize noncash straightline rent over time this change does not affect our cash flow or our ability to pay dividends 

  we currently provide for the construction of facilities for tenants as part of longterm operating leases we capitalize certain interest costs associated with funds used to finance the construction of properties owned by us the amount capitalized is based upon the balance outstanding during the construction period using the rate of interest that approximates our cost of financing our interest expense is reduced by the amount capitalized we also typically charge a transaction fee at the commencement of construction the construction period commences upon funding and terminates upon the earlier of the completion of the applicable facility or the end of a specified period generally 12 to 18 months during the construction period we advance funds to the operator in accordance with agreed upon terms and conditions which require among other things a site 

5 visit by a company representative prior to the advancement of funds during the construction period we generally require an additional credit enhancement in the form of payment and performance bonds andor completion guaranties at december 31 2004 we had outstanding construction investments of 26183000 25463000 for leased properties and 720000 for construction loans and were committed to providing additional funds of approximately 3833000 to complete construction 

   our investments in mortgage loans are typically structured to provide us with interest income principal amortization and transaction fees and are generally secured by a first or second mortgage lien or leasehold mortgage 

  at december 31 2004 the interest rates excluding any loans on nonaccrual averaged approximately 97 per annum on our outstanding mortgage loan balances our yield on mortgage loans depends upon a number of factors including the stated interest rate average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments 

  the mortgage loans outstanding at december 31 2004 are generally subject to three to 20year terms with principal amortization schedules andor balloon payment of the outstanding principal balance at the end of the term generally the mortgage loans provide three to eight years of prepayment protection 

   working capital loans are loans made to operators of facilities and are typically either secured andor guaranteed these instruments have terms ranging from three months to ten years at december 31 2004 the average interest rates excluding any loans on nonaccrual were approximately 106 per annum on our outstanding working capital loan balances at december 31 2004 we had provided working capital loans to 16 operators 

   subdebt investments are loans made to operators of facilities and are generally secured by the operator’s leasehold rights and corporate guaranties generally these instruments are for four to sevenyear terms at december 31 2004 the average interest rates excluding any loans on nonaccrual were approximately 106 per annum on our outstanding subdebt investment balances at december 31 2004 we had provided subdebt financing to four operators 

   we had an investment in atlantic healthcare finance lp a property group that specializes in the financing through sale and leaseback transactions of nursing and care homes located in the united kingdom this investment was accounted for under the equity method of accounting because we had the ability to exercise significant influence but not control over the company due to our 31 ownership interest in october 2003 we sold our investment in atlantic healthcare finance lp generating a net gain of 902000 

  other equity investments which consist of investments in private and public companies for which we do not have the ability to exercise influence are accounted for under the cost method under the cost method of accounting investments in private companies are carried at cost and are adjusted only for otherthantemporary declines in fair value distributions of earnings and additional investments for investments in public companies that have readily determinable fair market values we classify our equity investments as availableforsale and accordingly record these investments at their fair market values with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income a separate component of stockholders’ equity these investments represent a minimal ownership interest in these companies 

6 borrowing policies 

  we utilize a combination of debt and equity to fund the purchase of new properties and to provide mortgage loans our debt to equity levels are determined by management to maintain a conservative credit profile generally we intend to issue unsecured fixed rate public debt with longerterm maturities to approximate the maturities on our leases and loans for shortterm purposes we may borrow on our unsecured lines of credit arrangements we replace these borrowings with longerterm capital such as unsecured senior notes common stock or preferred stock when terms are deemed favorable we may invest in properties subject to existing mortgage indebtedness in addition we may obtain financing for unleveraged properties in which we have invested or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis it is our intent to limit secured indebtedness in our agreements with our lenders we are subject to restrictions with respect to secured and unsecured indebtedness 

operator concentrations 

  the following table summarizes certain information about our operator concentrations as of december 31 2004 dollars in thousands 

   

 7 competition 

  we compete with other real estate investment trusts real estate partnerships banks insurance companies finance companies governmentsponsored agencies taxable and taxexempt bond funds and other investors in the acquisition leasing and financing of health care facilities we compete for investments based on a number of factors including rates financings offered underwriting criterion and reputation the operators of our facilities compete on a local and regional basis with operators of facilities that provide comparable services operators compete for patients and residents based on a number of factors including quality of care reputation physical appearance of facilities services offered family preferences physicians staff and price 

employees 

  as of december 31 2004 we employed 39 fulltime employees 

certain government regulations 

   we invest in assisted living skilled nursing and specialty care facilities which represented approximately 54 39 and 7 respectively of our investments at december 31 2004 

  typically operators of assisted living facilities do not receive significant funding from governmental programs and are regulated by the states not the federal government operators of skilled nursing and specialty care facilities are subject to federal and state laws that regulate the type and quality of the medical andor nursing care provided ancillary services eg respiratory occupational physical and infusion therapies qualifications of the administrative personnel and nursing staff the adequacy of the physical plant and equipment distribution of pharmaceuticals reimbursement and rate setting and operating policies in addition as described below some of our facility operators are subject to extensive laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including kickbacks physician selfreferrals and false claims 

   the primary regulations that affect assisted living facilities are the states’ licensing laws in granting and renewing these licenses the regulatory authorities consider numerous factors relating to a facility’s physical plant and operations including but not limited to admission and discharge standards and staffing and training a decision to grant or renew a license is also affected by a facility’s record with respect to consumer rights and medication guidelines and rules 

  generally our skilled nursing and specialty care facilities are required to be licensed on an annual or biannual basis and to be certified for participation in the medicare and medicaid programs these facilities are subject to audits and surveys by various regulatory agencies that determine compliance with federal state and local laws the failure of our facility operators to maintain or renew any required license or regulatory approval or the failure to clear serious survey deficiencies could prevent them from continuing operations at a property in addition if a facility is found out of compliance with the conditions of participation in medicare medicaid or other health care programs or if a facility is otherwise excluded from those programs the facility may be barred from participation in government reimbursement programs any of these occurrences may impair the ability of our operators to meet their obligations to us if we have to replace a facility operator our ability to replace the operator may be affected by federal and state rules and policies governing changes in control under current medicare and medicaid rules and regulations and provider contracts a successor operator that assumes an existing provider agreement will typically be subject to certain liabilities of the previous operator including overpayments terms under any existing plan of correction and possibly sanctions and penalties if a successor operator chooses to apply for a new medicare andor medicaid provider agreement the successor operator may experience interruptions and delays in reimbursement during the processing of its application for a new provider agreement or its application may not be approved this may result in payment delays an inability to find a replacement operator a significant working capital commitment from us to a new operator or other difficulties 

   assisted living facilities approximately 55 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2004 were attributable to assisted living facilities the majority of the revenues received by the operators of our assisted living facilities are from private pay sources the remaining revenue source is primarily medicaid waiver programs as a part of the omnibus budget reconciliation act “obra” of 1981 congress established a waiver program under medicaid to offer an alternative to institutional longterm care services the provisions of obra and the subsequent obra acts of 1987 and 1990 allow states flexibility in developing costeffective alternatives to longterm care including assisted living and home health at december 31 2004 ten of our 31 assisted living operators utilized medicaid waivers for the year ended december 31 2004 approximately 11 of the revenues at our assisted living facilities were from medicaid reimbursement 

  rates paid by selfpay residents are set by the facilities and are largely determined by local market conditions and operating costs generally facilities receive a higher payment per day for a private pay resident than for a medicaid beneficiary who requires a comparable level of care the level of medicaid reimbursement varies from state to state thus the revenues generated by operators of our assisted living facilities may be adversely affected by payor mix acuity level and changes in medicaid eligibility and reimbursement levels changes in revenues could in turn have a material adverse effect on an operator’s ability to meet its obligation to us 

  skilled nursing facilities and specialty care facilities skilled nursing and specialty care facilities typically receive most of their revenues from medicare and medicaid with the balance representing private pay including private insurance consequently skilled nursing and specialty care facilities rely heavily on government reimbursement changes in federal or state reimbursement policies including changes in payment rates as a result of federal or state regulatory action or payment delays by fiscal intermediaries may also adversely affect an operator’s ability to cover its expenses including our rent or debt service skilled nursing and specialty care facilities are subject to periodic pre and postpayment reviews and other audits by federal and state authorities a review or audit of claims of a facility operator could result in recoupments denials or delays of payments in the future which could have a material adverse effect on the operator’s ability to meet its obligations to us due to the significant judgments and estimates inherent in payor settlement accounting no assurance can be given as to the adequacy of any reserves maintained by our facility operators for potential adjustments to reimbursements for payor settlements due to budgetary constraints governmental payors may limit or reduce payments to skilled nursing and specialty care facilities as a result of government reimbursement programs being subject to such budgetary pressures and legislative and administrative actions an operator’s ability to meet its obligations to us may be significantly impaired 

  medicare reimbursement and skilled nursing facilities for the year ended december 31 2004 approximately 28 of the revenues at our skilled nursing facilities which comprised 39 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2004 were from medicare reimbursement in an effort to reduce federal spending on health care the balanced budget act of 1997 “bba” contained extensive changes to the medicare and medicaid programs intended to reduce the projected payments under these programs the bba fundamentally altered medicare payment methodologies for skilled nursing facilities by mandating the institution of the skilled nursing facility prospective payment system this system differs significantly from the prior costbased reimbursement system among other things it sets per diem rates based on 1995 cost reports as adjusted by a variety of factors including but not limited to costs associated with 44 resource utilization group categories “rugs” the payments received under the skilled nursing facility prospective payment system cover services for medicare patients including all ancillary services such as respiratory physical and occupational therapy and certain covered medications the skilled nursing facility prospective payment system caused medicare per diem reimbursement for skilled nursing facility services to decrease the reductions in medicare payments resulted in immediate financial difficulties for skilled nursing facilities and caused a number of operators to seek bankruptcy protection 

  since the bba’s passage in 1997 the federal government has passed legislation to lessen the negative financial impact from the prospective payment system for example under the balanced budget refinement 

9 act of 1999 “bbra” and the benefits improvement and patient protection act of 2000 “bipa” some of the mandatory reductions in medicare payment increases were reversed or delayed and skilled nursing facilities received temporary payment increases bbra included two key provisions i a 20 increase for 15 of the rugs and ii a 4 acrosstheboard increase to the federal per diem rate the 20 increase was implemented in april 2000 and will remain in effect until the implementation of refinements in the current rug casemix classification system the 4 increase was implemented in april 2000 and expired on september 30 2002 bipa also included two key provisions i a 1666 increase in the nursing component of the federal per diem rate and ii a 67 increase in the 14 rug payments for rehabilitation therapy services the 1666 increase was implemented in april of 2001 and expired on september 30 2002 the 67 increase is an adjustment to the 20 increase granted in bbra and spreads the funds directed at three of those 15 rugs to an additional 11 rehabilitation rugs this increase was implemented in april 2001 and will remain in effect until the implementation of refinements in the current rug casemix classification system the 4 and 1666 increases that expired on september 30 2002 decreased annual reimbursement by roughly 18 billion although the centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” did not implement rug refinements for fiscal year 2005 annual reimbursement could be reduced by roughly 15 billion if a new casemix system is implemented in the future there is no assurance that the new casemix classification will account for this reduction so that nursing facilities are not adversely affected 

  skilled nursing facilities received a 28 inflation basket increase in medicare payments for federal fiscal year 2005 the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 imposed a moratorium on the therapy caps for part b outpatient rehabilitation services through december 31 2005 the therapy caps were mandated by the bba if ever imposed the annual payment cap of 1590 per patient would apply to both occupational therapy and physical and speech therapy patients exceeding the cap would need to use private funds to pay for the cost of additional therapy 

  medicare reimbursement and specialty care facilities for the year ended december 31 2004 approximately 45 of the revenues at our specialty care facilities which comprised 6 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2004 were from medicare specialty care facilities generally are reimbursed by medicare under either the diagnosis related groupoutpatient prospective payment system reimbursement methodology for regular hospitals or the new prospective payment system for inpatient rehabilitation facilities acute care hospitals provide a wide range of inpatient and outpatient services including but not limited to surgery rehabilitation therapy and clinical laboratories longterm acute care hospitals provide inpatient services for patients with complex medical conditions that require more intensive care monitoring or emergency support than that available in most skilled nursing facilities some of our other specialty care facilities provide specialized inpatient and outpatient services for specific illnesses or diseases including among others orthopedic neurosurgical and behavioral care services 

  with respect to medicare’s diagnosis related groupoutpatient prospective payment system methodology for regular hospitals reimbursement for inpatient services is on the basis of a fixed prospective rate based on the principal diagnosis of the patient diagnoses are grouped into more than 500 diagnosis related groups in some cases a hospital might be able to qualify for an outlier payment if the hospital’s charges exceed a threshold cms has revised its outlier methodology in response to allegations that some hospitals increased their outlier reimbursement by substantially increasing charges under the revisions outlier reimbursement for all hospitals is expected to decline in addition the government is evaluating the past practices of hospitals relating to outlier payments if any of the operators of our specialty care facilities were found to have substantially increased charges in an attempt to increase outlier payments there is a risk that such operators could be investigated and required to refund a portion of outlier payments received plus possible penalties 

  congress has limited increases in diagnosis related groups or outpatient prospective payment system payments these limited increases may not be sufficient to cover specialty care facilities’ increasing costs of providing care failure to increase reimbursement to cover increased costs or reductions or freezes in payment rates will have an adverse impact on operators of our specialty care facilities 

  the bba as amended by bbra and bipa also authorized the development of a prospective payment system for inpatient rehabilitation facilities including freestanding rehabilitation hospitals and rehabilitation 

10 units of acute care hospitals the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system methodology replaces the reasonable costbased payment system 

  under the final regulations that implemented the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment systems rehabilitation hospitals are required to complete a patient assessment instrument upon admission and discharge for all medicare part a feeforservice patients who are already inpatients or who are admitted or discharged on or after january 1 2002 based on the data received from the inpatient rehabilitation facility patient assessment instrument each patient is placed into a casemix group each casemix group is a functionalrelated group determined by distinguishing classes of inpatient rehabilitation facility patient discharges on the basis of impairment age comorbidities functional capability of the patient and other factors the medicare program deems appropriate to improve the explanatory power of functional independence measure function related groups the case mix group determines the base payment rate for the medicarecovered part a services furnished by the inpatient rehabilitation facility during the beneficiary’s episode of care inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system rates encompass the inpatient capital costs and operating costs including routine and ancillary costs of furnishing covered rehabilitation services other indirect operating costs including among other things bad debts approved educational activities and nonphysician anesthetist’s services are not included payment rates are calculated using relative weights to account for variations in resource needs in case mix groups 

  pursuant to the bba as amended by bbra and bipa payments during fiscal years 2001 and 2002 were budget neutral with payments for fiscal year 2001 equaling 98 of the amount of payments that would have been paid if the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system had not been enacted and 100 for fiscal year 2002 for cost reporting periods beginning on or after october 1 2002 payment is based solely on the adjusted federal prospective payment 

  the ability of our operators to adjust to the shift from reasonable cost reimbursement to an inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system will impact the cash flow of these facilities failure to control costs or manage the care provided under the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system would have an adverse impact on an operators’ ability to meet their obligations to us 

  medicaid reimbursement medicaid is a major payor source for residents in our skilled nursing and specialty care facilities for the year ended december 31 2004 approximately 56 of the revenues of our skilled nursing facilities and 29 of the revenues of our specialty care facilities were attributable to medicaid payments the federal government and the states share responsibility for financing medicaid the federal matching rate known as the federal medical assistance percentage varies by state based on relative per capita income medicaid is typically the second largest item in state budgets representing approximately 17 on average after elementary and secondary education the percentage of medicaid dollars used for longterm care varies from state to state due in part to different ratios of elderly population and eligibility requirements with certain federal guidelines states have a wide range of discretion to determine eligibility and reimbursement methodology many states reimburse longterm care facilities using fixed daily rates which are applied prospectively based on the historical costs incurred in providing patient care reasonable costs typically include allowances for staffing administrative and general and property and equipment eg depreciation and fair rental 

  in most states medicaid does not fully reimburse the cost of providing skilled nursing services the shortfall is due in part to the bba which repealed the boren amendment the boren amendment required states to fund medicaid expenditures in an amount that was sufficient to cover the reasonable costs of an efficient provider consequently medicaid funding is vulnerable to state balanced budget requirements due to declining tax revenues some states are attempting to slow the rate of growth in medicaid expenditures by freezing rates or restricting eligibility and benefits states in which we have skilled nursing facility investments increased their per diem medicaid rates roughly 3 on average for fiscal year 2005 two of our states reduced medicaid rates in fiscal year 2005 per diem rates at most of our facilities in these two states decreased 0 to 4 versus the previous year despite any budgeted rate increases longterm care rates may decline if revenues in a particular state are not sufficient to fund budgeted expenditures 

11   the reimbursement methodologies applied to health care facilities continue to evolve federal and state authorities have considered and may seek to implement new or modified reimbursement methodologies that may negatively impact health care facility operations the impact of any such change if implemented may result in a material adverse effect on our skilled nursing and specialty care facility operations no assurance can be given that current revenue sources or levels will be maintained accordingly there can be no assurance that payments under a government reimbursement program are currently or will in the future be sufficient to fully reimburse the facility operators for their operating and capital expenses as a result an operator’s ability to meet its obligations to us could be adversely impacted 

   skilled nursing and specialty care facilities and assisted living facilities that receive medicaid payments are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations including those laws and regulations prohibiting fraud and abuse which govern the operations and financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by health care providers certain of these laws prohibit direct or indirect payments of any kind for the purpose of inducing or encouraging the referral of patients for medical products or services reimbursable by governmental programs other laws require providers to furnish only medically necessary services and submit to the government valid and accurate statements for each service still other laws require providers to comply with a variety of safety health and other requirements relating to the condition of the licensed facility and the quality of care provided sanctions for violation of these laws and regulations may include but are not limited to criminal andor civil penalties and fines and a loss of licensure and immediate termination of governmental payments in certain circumstances violation of these rules such as those prohibiting abusive and fraudulent behavior with respect to one facility may subject other facilities under common control or ownership to sanctions including disqualification from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs in the ordinary course of its business a facility operator is regularly subjected to inquiries investigations and audits by federal and state agencies that oversee these laws and regulations 

  each skilled nursing and specialty care facility and any assisted living facility that receives medicaid payments is subject to the federal antikickback statute that generally prohibits persons from offering providing soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing of a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal health care program such as the medicare and medicaid programs skilled nursing and specialty care facilities are also subject to the federal ethics in patient referral act of 1989 commonly referred to as the stark law the stark law generally prohibits the submission of claims to medicare for payment if the claim results from a physician referral for certain designated services and the physician has a financial relationship with the health service provider that does not qualify under one of the exceptions for a financial relationship under the stark law similar prohibitions on physician selfreferrals and submission of claims apply to state medicaid programs further skilled nursing and specialty care facilities and assisted living facilities that receive medicaid payments are subject to substantial financial penalties under the civil monetary penalties act and the false claims act and in particular actions under the false claims act’s “whistleblower” provisions private enforcement of health care fraud has increased due in large part to amendments to the false claims act that encourage private individuals to sue on behalf of the government these whistleblower suits by private individuals known as qui tam actions may be filed by almost anyone including present and former patients nurses and other employees prosecutions investigations or qui tam actions could have a material adverse effect on a facility operator’s liquidity financial condition and results of operations which could adversely affect the ability of the operator to meet its obligations to us finally various state false claim and antikickback laws also may apply to each facility operator violation of any of the foregoing statutes can result in criminal andor civil penalties that could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its obligations to us 

  the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 which became effective january 1 1997 greatly expanded the definition of health care fraud and related offenses and broadened its scope to include private health care plans in addition to government payors it also greatly increased funding for the department of justice federal bureau of investigation and the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services to audit investigate and prosecute suspected health care fraud 

12 additionally the administrative simplification provisions of this law provide for communication of health information through standard electronic transaction formats and for the privacy and security of health information in order to comply with the regulations health care providers must undergo significant operational and technical changes and these modifications may represent significant costs for our health care providers these additional costs may in turn adversely affect the ability of our operators to meet their obligations to us 

  finally government investigation and enforcement of health care laws has increased dramatically over the past several years and is expected to continue some of these enforcement actions represent novel legal theories and expansions in the application of false claims laws the costs for an operator of a health care facility associated with both defending such enforcement actions and the undertakings in settlement agreements can be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its obligations to us

   we elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust or reit commencing with our first taxable year we intend to continue to operate in such a manner as to qualify as a reit but there is no guarantee that we will qualify or remain qualified as a reit for subsequent years qualification and taxation as a reit depends upon our ability to meet a variety of qualification tests imposed under federal income tax law with respect to income assets distribution level and diversity of share ownership as discussed below under “— qualification as a reit” there can be no assurance that we will be owned and organized and will operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified 

  in any year in which we qualify as a reit in general we will not be subject to federal income tax on that portion of our reit taxable income or capital gain that is distributed to stockholders we may however be subject to tax at normal corporate rates on any taxable income or capital gain not distributed if we elect to retain and pay income tax on our net longterm capital gain stockholders are required to include their proportionate share of our undistributed longterm capital gain in income but they will receive a refundable credit for their share of any taxes paid by us on such gain 

13   despite the reit election we may be subject to federal income and excise tax as follows 

   if we acquire any assets from a corporation which is or has been a “c” corporation in a carryover basis transaction we could be liable for specified liabilities that are inherited from the “c” corporation a “c” corporation is generally defined as a corporation that is required to pay full corporate level federal income tax if we recognize gain on the disposition of the assets during the tenyear period beginning on the date on which the assets were acquired by us then to the extent of the assets’ “builtin gain” ie the excess of the fair market value of the asset over the adjusted tax basis in the asset in each case determined as of the beginning of the tenyear period we will be subject to tax on the gain at the highest regular corporate rate applicable the results described in this paragraph with respect to the recognition of builtin gain assume that the builtin gain assets at the time the builtin gain assets were subject to a conversion transaction either where a “c” corporation elected reit status or a reit acquired the assets from a “c” corporation were not treated as sold to an unrelated party and gain recognized 

   a reit is defined as a corporation trust or association 

   conditions 1 to 4 inclusive must be met during the entire taxable year and condition 5 must be met during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months for purposes of conditions 5 and 6 pension funds and certain other taxexempt entities are treated as individuals subject to a “lookthrough” exception in the case of condition 6 

  based on publicly available information we believe we have satisfied the share ownership requirements set forth in 5 and 6 above in addition article vi of our amended and restated bylaws provides for restrictions regarding ownership and transfer of shares these restrictions are intended to assist us in continuing to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in 5 and 6 above these restrictions however may not ensure that we will in all cases be able to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in 5 and 6 above 

  we have complied with and will continue to comply with regulatory rules to send annual letters to certain of our stockholders requesting information regarding the actual ownership of our stock if despite sending the annual letters we do not know or after exercising reasonable diligence would not have known whether we failed to meet the five or fewer requirement we will be treated as having met the five or fewer requirement if we fail to comply with these regulatory rules we will be subject to a monetary penalty if our failure to comply was due to intentional disregard of the requirement the penalty would be increased however if our failure to comply were due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect no penalty would be imposed 

  we may own a number of properties through wholly owned subsidiaries a corporation will qualify as a “qualified reit subsidiary” if 100 of its stock is owned by a reit and the reit does not elect to treat the subsidiary as a taxable reit subsidiary a “qualified reit subsidiary” will not be treated as a separate corporation and all assets liabilities and items of income deductions and credits of a “qualified reit subsidiary” will be treated as assets liabilities and items as the case may be of the reit a “qualified reit subsidiary” is not subject to federal income tax and our ownership of the voting stock of a qualified reit subsidiary will not violate the restrictions against ownership of securities of any one issuer which constitute more than 10 of the value or total voting power of such issuer or more than 5 of the value of our total assets as described below under “— asset tests” 

  if we invest in a partnership a limited liability company or a trust taxed as a partnership or as a disregarded entity we will be deemed to own a proportionate share of the partnership’s limited liability company’s or trust’s assets likewise we will be treated as receiving our share of the income and loss of the partnership limited liability company or trust and the gross income will retain the same character in our 

15 hands as it has in the hands of the partnership limited liability company or trust these “lookthrough” rules apply for purposes of the income tests and assets tests described below 

  income tests there are two separate percentage tests relating to our sources of gross income that we must satisfy for each taxable year 

   for taxable years beginning on or before october 22 2004 i payments to us under an interest rate swap or cap agreement option futures contract forward rate agreement or any similar financial instrument entered into by us to reduce interest rate risk on indebtedness incurred or to be incurred and ii gain from the sale or other disposition of any such investment are treated as income qualifying under the 95 gross income test for taxable years beginning after october 22 2004 any of our income from a “clearly identified” hedging transaction that is entered into by us in the normal course of business directly or indirectly to manage the risk of interest rate movements price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings or obligations incurred or to be incurred by us or such other risks that are prescribed by the internal revenue service is excluded from the 95 gross income test in general a hedging transaction is “clearly identified” if i the transaction is identified as a hedging transaction before the end of the day on which it is entered into and ii the items or risks being hedged are identified “substantially contemporaneously” with the hedging transaction an identification is not substantially contemporaneous if it is made more than 35 days after entering into the hedging transaction 

  rents received by us will qualify as “rents from real property” for purposes of satisfying the gross income tests for a reit only if several conditions are met 

   for taxable years beginning after august 5 1997 a reit has been permitted to render a de minimis amount of impermissible services to tenants and still treat amounts received with respect to that property as rent from real property the amount received or accrued by the reit during the taxable year for the impermissible services with respect to a property may not exceed 1 of all amounts received or accrued by the reit directly or indirectly from the property the amount received for any service or management operation 

16 for this purpose shall be deemed to be not less than 150 of the direct cost of the reit in furnishing or rendering the service or providing the management or operation furthermore impermissible services may be furnished to tenants by a taxable reit subsidiary subject to certain conditions and we may still treat rents received with respect to the property as rent from real property 

  the term “interest” generally does not include any amount if the determination of the amount depends in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person although an amount generally will not be excluded from the term “interest” solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage of receipts or sales 

  if we fail to satisfy one or both of the 75 or 95 gross income tests for any taxable year we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for such year if we are eligible for relief for taxable years beginning on or before october 22 2004 these relief provisions generally will be available if a our failure to meet such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect b we attach a schedule of the sources of our income to our return and c any incorrect information on the schedule was not due to fraud with intent to evade tax for taxable years beginning after october 22 2004 these relief provisions generally will be available if a following our identification of the failure we file a schedule for such taxable year describing each item of our gross income and b the failure to meet such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect 

  it is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions if these relief provisions apply a 100 tax is imposed on an amount equal to a the gross income attributable to i 75 of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75 income test and ii 95 of our gross income 90 of our gross income for taxable years beginning on or before october 22 2004 over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 95 income test multiplied by b a fraction intended to reflect our profitability 

  asset tests within 30 days after the close of each quarter of our taxable year we must also satisfy several tests relating to the nature and diversification of our assets determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles at least 75 of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets cash cash items including receivables arising in the ordinary course of our operation government securities and qualified temporary investments although the remaining 25 of our assets generally may be invested without restriction we are prohibited from owning securities representing more than 10 of either the vote the “10 vote test” or value the “10 value test” of the outstanding securities of any issuer other than a qualified reit subsidiary another reit or a taxable reit subsidiary further no more than 20 of the total assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries the “20 asset test” and no more than 5 of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities of any nongovernmental issuer other than a qualified reit subsidiary the “5 asset test” another reit or a taxable reit subsidiary each of the 10 vote test the 10 value test and the 20 and 5 asset tests must be satisfied at the end of each quarter there are special rules which provide relief if the value related tests are not satisfied due to changes in the value of the assets of a reit 

  for taxable years beginning after december 31 2000 certain items are excluded from the 10 value test including i straight debt securities of an issuer including straight debt that provides certain contingent payments ii any loan to an individual or an estate iii any rental agreement described in section 467 of the internal revenue code other than with a “related person” iv any obligation to pay rents from real property v certain securities issued by a state or any subdivision thereof the district of columbia a foreign government or any political subdivision thereof or the commonwealth of puerto rico vi any security issued by a reit and vii any other arrangement that as determined by the secretary of the treasury is excepted from the definition of security “excluded securities” special rules apply to straight debt securities issued by corporations and entities taxable as partnerships for federal income tax purposes if a reit or its taxable reit subsidiary holds i straight debt securities of a corporate or partnership issuer and ii securities of such issuer that are not excluded securities and have an aggregate value greater than 1 of such issuer’s outstanding securities the straight debt securities will be included in the 10 value test 

  for taxable years beginning after december 31 2000 a reit’s interest as a partner in a partnership is not treated as a security for purposes of applying the 10 value test to securities issued by the partnership 

17 further any debt instrument issued by a partnership will not be a security for purposes of applying the 10 value test i to the extent of the reit’s interest as a partner in the partnership and ii if at least 75 of the partnership’s gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions would qualify for the 75 gross income test for taxable years beginning after october 22 2004 for purposes of the 10 value test a reit’s interest in a partnership’s assets is the reit’s proportionate interest in any securities issued by the partnership other than the excluded securities described in the preceding paragraph 

  for taxable years beginning after october 22 2004 following the 30 day cure period after the close of a taxable quarter for violations of the 10 vote test the 10 value test or the 5 asset test a reit may avoid disqualification as a reit by disposing of sufficient assets to cure a violation that does not exceed the lesser of 1 of the reit’s assets at the end of the relevant quarter or 10000000 provided that the disposition occurs within six months following the last day of the quarter in which the reit first identified the assets for violations of any of the reit asset tests due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that exceed the thresholds described in the preceding sentence a reit can avoid disqualification as a reit following the 30 day cure period after the close of a taxable quarter by taking certain steps including disposition of sufficient assets within the six month period described above to meet the applicable asset test paying a tax equal to the greater of 50000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets during the period of time that the assets were held as nonqualifying assets and filing a schedule with the internal revenue service that describes the nonqualifying assets 

  investments in taxable reit subsidiaries for taxable years beginning after december 31 2000 reits may own more than 10 of the voting power and value of securities in taxable reit subsidiaries we and any taxable corporate entity in which we own an interest are allowed to jointly elect to treat such entity as a “taxable reit subsidiary” 

  several of our subsidiaries have elected to be treated as a taxable reit subsidiary taxable reit subsidiaries are subject to full corporate level federal taxation on their earnings but are permitted to engage in certain types of activities that cannot be performed directly by reits without jeopardizing their reit status our taxable reit subsidiaries will attempt to minimize the amount of these taxes but there can be no assurance whether or the extent to which measures taken to minimize taxes will be successful to the extent our taxable reit subsidiaries are required to pay federal state or local taxes the cash available for distribution as dividends to us from our taxable reit subsidiaries will be reduced 

  the amount of interest on relatedparty debt that a taxable reit subsidiary may deduct is limited further a 100 tax applies to any interest payments by a taxable reit subsidiary to its affiliated reit to the extent the interest rate is not commercially reasonable a taxable reit subsidiary is permitted to deduct interest payments to unrelated parties without any of these restrictions 

  the internal revenue service may reallocate costs between a reit and its taxable reit subsidiary where there is a lack of arm’slength dealing between the parties any deductible expenses allocated away from a taxable reit subsidiary would increase its tax liability further any amount by which a reit understates its deductions and overstates those of its taxable reit subsidiary will subject to certain exceptions be subject to a 100 tax additional taxable reit subsidiary elections may be made in the future for additional entities in which we own an interest 

  annual distribution requirements in order to avoid being taxed as a regular corporation we are required to make distributions other than capital gain distributions to our stockholders which qualify for the dividends paid deduction in an amount at least equal to a the sum of i 90 of our “reit taxable income” computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain and ii 90 of the aftertax net income if any from foreclosure property minus b a portion of certain items of noncash income these distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for that year and if paid on or before the first regular distribution payment after such declaration the amount distributed must not be preferential this means that every stockholder of the class of stock to which a distribution is made must be treated the same as every other stockholder of that class and no class of stock may be treated otherwise than in accordance with its dividend rights as a class to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90 but 

18 less than 100 of our “reit taxable income” as adjusted we will be subject to tax on the undistributed amount at regular corporate tax rates finally as discussed above we may be subject to an excise tax if we fail to meet certain other distribution requirements we intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy these annual distribution requirements 

  it is possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90 distribution requirement or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation due to among other things a timing differences between i the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses and ii the inclusion of income and deduction of expenses in arriving at our taxable income or b the payment of severance benefits that may not be deductible to us in the event that timing differences occur we may find it necessary to arrange for borrowings or if possible pay dividends in the form of taxable stock dividends in order to meet the distribution requirement 

  under certain circumstances in the event of a deficiency determined by the internal revenue service we may be able to rectify a resulting failure to meet the distribution requirement for a year by paying “deficiency dividends” to stockholders in a later year which may be included in our deduction for distributions paid for the earlier year thus we may be able to avoid being taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency distributions however we will be required to pay applicable penalties and interest based upon the amount of any deduction taken for deficiency distributions 

   if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates distributions to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify as a reit will not be deductible nor will any particular amount of distributions be required to be made in any year all distributions to stockholders will be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these distributions and subject to certain limitations will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporate stockholders unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions we also will be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to statutory relief failure to qualify for even one year could result in our need to incur indebtedness or liquidate investments in order to pay potentially significant resulting tax liabilities 

  in addition to the relief described above under “— income tests” and “— asset tests” relief is available in the event that we violate a provision of the internal revenue code that would result in our failure to qualify as a reit if i the violation is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect ii we pay a penalty of 50000 for each failure to satisfy the provision and iii the violation does not include a violation described under “— income tests” or “— asset tests” above it is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions 

   treatment of taxable us stockholders the following summary applies to you only if you are a “us stockholder” a “us stockholder” is a stockholder of shares of stock who for united states federal income tax purposes is 

 19 

   so long as we qualify for taxation as a reit distributions on shares of our stock made out of the current or accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these distributions and not designated as capital gain dividends will be includable as ordinary income for federal income tax purposes none of these distributions will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for us corporate stockholders 

  generally for taxable years ending after may 6 2003 through december 31 2008 the maximum marginal rate of tax payable by individuals on dividends received from corporations that are subject to a corporate level of tax is 15 except in limited circumstances this tax rate will not apply to dividends paid to you by us on our shares because generally we are not subject to federal income tax on the portion of our reit taxable income or capital gains distributed to our stockholders the reduced maximum federal income tax rate will apply to that portion if any of dividends received by you with respect to our shares that are attributable to 1 dividends received by us from nonreit corporations or other taxable reit subsidiaries 2 income from the prior year with respect to which we were required to pay federal corporate income tax during the prior year if for example we did not distribute 100 of our reit taxable income for the prior year or 3 the amount of any earnings and profits that were distributed by us and accumulated in a nonreit year 

  distributions that are designated as capital gain dividends will be taxed as longterm capital gains to the extent they do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year without regard to the period for which you held our stock however if you are a corporation you may be required to treat a portion of some capital gain dividends as ordinary income 

  if we elect to retain and pay income tax on any net longterm capital gain you would include in income as longterm capital gain your proportionate share of this net longterm capital gain you would also receive a refundable tax credit for your proportionate share of the tax paid by us on such retained capital gains and you would have an increase in the basis of your shares of our stock in an amount equal to your includable capital gains less your share of the tax deemed paid 

  you may not include in your federal income tax return any of our net operating losses or capital losses federal income tax rules may also require that certain minimum tax adjustments and preferences be apportioned to you in addition any distribution declared by us in october november or december of any year on a specified date in any such month shall be treated as both paid by us and received by you on december 31 of that year provided that the distribution is actually paid by us no later than january 31 of the following year 

  we will be treated as having sufficient earnings and profits to treat as a dividend any distribution up to the amount required to be distributed in order to avoid imposition of the 4 excise tax discussed under “— general” and “— qualification as a reit — annual distribution requirements” above as a result you may be required to treat as taxable dividends certain distributions that would otherwise result in a taxfree return of capital moreover any “deficiency dividend” will be treated as a dividend an ordinary dividend or a capital gain dividend as the case may be regardless of our earnings and profits any other distributions in excess of current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to you to the extent these distributions do not exceed the adjusted tax basis of your shares of our stock you will be required to reduce the tax basis of your shares of our stock by the amount of these distributions until the basis has been reduced to zero after which these distributions will be taxable as capital gain if the shares of our stock are held as a capital asset the tax basis as so reduced will be used in computing the capital gain or loss if any realized upon sale of the shares of our stock any loss upon a sale or exchange of shares of our stock which were held for six months or less after application of certain holding period rules will generally be treated as a longterm capital loss to the extent you previously received capital gain distributions with respect to these shares of our stock 

  upon the sale or exchange of any shares of our stock to or with a person other than us or a sale or exchange of all shares of our stock whether actually or constructively owned with us you will generally 

20 recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your adjusted tax basis in these shares of our stock this gain will be capital gain if you held these shares of our stock as a capital asset 

  if we redeem any of your shares in us the treatment can only be determined on the basis of particular facts at the time of redemption in general you will recognize gain or loss as opposed to dividend income equal to the difference between the amount received by you in the redemption and your adjusted tax basis in your shares redeemed if such redemption results in a “complete termination” of your interest in all classes of our equity securities is a “substantially disproportionate redemption” or is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” with respect to you in applying these tests there must be taken into account your ownership of all classes of our equity securities eg common stock preferred stock depositary shares and warrants you also must take into account any equity securities that are considered to be constructively owned by you 

  if as a result of a redemption by us of your shares you no longer own either actually or constructively any of our equity securities or only own actually and constructively an insubstantial percentage of our equity securities then it is probable that the redemption of your shares would be considered “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” and thus would result in gain or loss to you however whether a distribution is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” depends on all of the facts and circumstances and if you rely on any of these tests at the time of redemption you should consult your tax advisor to determine their application to the particular situation 

  generally if the redemption does not meet the tests described above then the proceeds received by you from the redemption of your shares will be treated as a distribution taxable as a dividend to the extent of the allocable portion of current or accumulated earnings and profits if the redemption is taxed as a dividend your adjusted tax basis in the redeemed shares will be transferred to any other shareholdings in us that you own if you own no other shareholdings in us under certain circumstances such basis may be transferred to a related person or it may be lost entirely 

  gain from the sale or exchange of our shares held for more than one year is taxed at a maximum longterm capital gain rate which is currently 15 pursuant to internal revenue service guidance we may classify portions of our capital gain dividends as gains eligible for the longterm capital gains rate or as gain taxable to individual stockholders at a maximum rate of 25 

  treatment of taxexempt us stockholders taxexempt entities including qualified employee pension and profit sharing trusts and individual retirement accounts “exempt organizations” generally are exempt from federal income taxation however they are subject to taxation on their unrelated business taxable income “ubti” the internal revenue service has issued a published revenue ruling that dividend distributions from a reit to an exempt employee pension trust do not constitute ubti provided that the shares of the reit are not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business of the exempt employee pension trust based on this ruling amounts distributed by us to exempt organizations generally should not constitute ubti however if an exempt organization finances its acquisition of the shares of our stock with debt a portion of its income from us will constitute ubti pursuant to the “debt financed property” rules likewise a portion of the exempt organization’s income from us would constitute ubti if we held a residual interest in a real estate mortgage investment conduit 

  in addition in certain circumstances a pension trust that owns more than 10 of our stock is required to treat a percentage of our dividends as ubti this rule applies to a pension trust holding more than 10 of our stock only if i the percentage of our income that is ubti determined as if we were a pension trust is at least 5 ii we qualify as a reit by reason of the modification of the five or fewer requirement that allows beneficiaries of the pension trust to be treated as holding shares in proportion to their actuarial interests in the pension trust and iii either a one pension trust owns more than 25 of the value of our stock or b a group of pension trusts individually holding more than 10 of the value of our stock collectively own more than 50 of the value of our stock 

  backup withholding and information reporting under certain circumstances you may be subject to backup withholding at applicable rates on payments made with respect to or cash proceeds of a sale or 

21 exchange of shares of our stock backup withholding will apply only if you 1 fail to provide a correct taxpayer identification number which if you are an individual is ordinarily your social security number 2 furnish an incorrect taxpayer identification number 3 are notified by the internal revenue service that you have failed to properly report payments of interest or dividends or 4 fail to certify under penalties of perjury that you have furnished a correct taxpayer identification number and that the internal revenue service has not notified you that you are subject to backup withholding 

  backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients such as corporations and taxexempt organizations you should consult with a tax advisor regarding qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining an exemption backup withholding is not an additional tax rather the amount of any backup withholding with respect to payment to a stockholder will be allowed as a credit against such stockholder’s united states federal income tax liability and may entitle such stockholder to a refund provided that the required information is provided to the internal revenue service in addition withholding a portion of capital gain distributions made to stockholders may be required for stockholders who fail to certify their nonforeign status 

  taxation of foreign stockholders the following summary applies to you only if you are a foreign person the federal taxation of foreign persons is a highly complex matter that may be affected by many considerations 

  except as discussed below distributions to you of cash generated by our real estate operations in the form of ordinary dividends but not by the sale or exchange of our capital assets generally will be subject to us withholding tax at a rate of 30 unless an applicable tax treaty reduces that tax and you file with us the required form evidencing the lower rate 

  in general you will be subject to united states federal income tax on a graduated rate basis rather than withholding with respect to your investment in our stock if such investment is “effectively connected” with your conduct of a trade or business in the united states a corporate foreign stockholder that receives income that is or is treated as effectively connected with a united states trade or business may also be subject to the branch profits tax which is payable in addition to regular united states corporate income tax the following discussion will apply to foreign stockholders whose investment in us is not so effectively connected we expect to withhold united states income tax as described below on the gross amount of any distributions paid to you unless i you file an internal revenue service form w8eci with us claiming that the distribution is “effectively connected” or ii certain other exceptions apply 

  distributions by us that are attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a united states real property interest will be taxed to you under the foreign investment in real property tax act of 1980 “firpta” as if these distributions were gains “effectively connected” with a united states trade or business accordingly you will be taxed at the normal capital gain rates applicable to a us stockholder on these amounts subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals distributions subject to firpta may also be subject to a branch profits tax in the hands of a corporate foreign stockholder that is not entitled to treaty exemption 

  we will be required to withhold from distributions subject to firpta and remit to the internal revenue service 35 of designated capital gain dividends or if greater 35 of the amount of any distributions that could be designated as capital gain dividends in addition if we designate prior distributions as capital gain dividends subsequent distributions up to the amount of the prior distributions not withheld against will be treated as capital gain dividends for purposes of withholding 

  for taxable years beginning after october 22 2004 any capital gain dividend with respect to any class of stock that is “regularly traded” on an established securities market will be treated as an ordinary dividend if the foreign stockholder did not own more than 5 of such class of stock at any time during the taxable year once this provision takes effect foreign stockholders generally will not be required to report distributions received from us on us federal income tax returns and all distributions treated as dividends for us federal income tax purposes including any capital gain dividend will be subject to a 30 us withholding tax unless 

22 reduced under an applicable income tax treaty as discussed above in addition the branch profits tax will no longer apply to such distributions 

  unless our shares constitute a “united states real property interest” within the meaning of firpta or are effectively connected with a us trade or business a sale of our shares by you generally will not be subject to united states taxation our shares will not constitute a united states real property interest if we qualify as a “domestically controlled reit” we do and expect to continue to qualify as a domestically controlled reit a domestically controlled reit is a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50 in value of its shares is held directly or indirectly by foreign stockholders however if you are a nonresident alien individual who is present in the united states for 183 days or more during the taxable year and certain other conditions apply you will be subject to a 30 tax on such capital gains in any event a purchaser of our shares from you will not be required under firpta to withhold on the purchase price if the purchased shares are “regularly traded” on an established securities market or if we are a domestically controlled reit otherwise under firpta the purchaser may be required to withhold 10 of the purchase price and remit such amount to the internal revenue service 

  backup withholding tax and information reporting will generally not apply to distributions paid to you outside the united states that are treated as i dividends to which the 30 or lower treaty rate withholding tax discussed above applies ii capital gains dividends or iii distributions attributable to gain from the sale or exchange by us of us real property interests payment of the proceeds of a sale of stock within the united states or conducted through certain us related financial intermediaries is subject to both backup withholding and information reporting unless the beneficial owner certifies under penalties of perjury that he or she is not a us person and the payor does not have actual knowledge that the beneficial owner is a us person or otherwise established an exemption you may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for refund with the internal revenue service 

   owners of our depositary shares will be treated as if you were owners of the series of preferred stock represented by the depositary shares thus you will be required to take into account the income and deductions to which you would be entitled if you were a holder of the underlying series of preferred stock 

  conversion or exchange of shares for preferred stock no gain or loss will be recognized upon the withdrawal of preferred stock in exchange for depositary shares and the tax basis of each share of preferred stock will upon exchange be the same as the aggregate tax basis of the depositary shares exchanged if you held your depositary shares as a capital asset at the time of the exchange for shares of preferred stock the holding period for your shares of preferred stock will include the period during which you owned the depositary shares

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   the following discussion and analysis is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of health care reit inc for the periods presented and should be read together with the notes thereto contained in this annual report on form 10k other important factors are identified in “item 1 — business” above 

executive overview 

   health care reit inc is a selfadministered equity real estate investment trust that invests in health care facilities primarily skilled nursing and assisted living facilities we also invest in specialty care facilities founded in 1970 we were the first reit to invest exclusively in health care facilities as of december 31 2004 longterm care facilities which include skilled nursing and assisted living facilities comprised approximately 93 of our investment portfolio the following table summarizes our portfolio as of december 31 2004 

  

   our primary objectives are to protect stockholders’ capital and enhance stockholder value we seek to pay consistent cash dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual increases in rental and interest income and portfolio growth to meet these objectives we invest primarily in longterm care facilities managed by experienced operators and diversify our investment portfolio by operator and geographic location 

  substantially all of our revenues and sources of cash flows from operations are derived from operating lease rentals and interest earned on outstanding loans receivable these items represent our primary source of liquidity to fund distributions and are dependent upon our operators’ continued ability to make contractual rent and interest payments to us to the extent that our operators experience operating difficulties and are unable to generate sufficient cash to make payments to us there could be a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity andor financial condition to mitigate this risk we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of health care facility and operator our monitoring process includes review of monthly financial statements for each facility quarterly review of operator credit annual facility inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure real estate taxes letters of credit and other collateral in monitoring our portfolio our personnel use a proprietary database to collect and analyze facilityspecific data additionally we conduct extensive research to ascertain industry trends and risks through these monitoring and research efforts we are typically able to intervene at 

34 an early stage and address payment risk and in so doing support both the collectibility of revenue and the value of our investment 

  in addition to our monitoring and research efforts we also structure our investments to help mitigate payment risk we typically invest in or finance up to 90 of the appraised value of a property operating leases and loans are normally credit enhanced by guaranties andor letters of credit in addition operating leases are typically structured as master leases and loans are generally crossdefaulted and crosscollateralized with other loans operating leases or agreements between us and the operator and its affiliates as of december 31 2004 85 of our real property was subject to master leases 96 of our real estate investments were crossdefaulted with other investments relating to the same operator and 78 of our real property loans were crosscollateralized with other loans to the same operator 

  for the year ended december 31 2004 rental income and interest income represented 90 and 9 respectively of total gross revenues prior to june 2004 our standard lease structure contained fixed annual rental escalators which were generally recognized on a straightline basis over the initial lease period beginning in june 2004 our new standard lease structure contains annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the consumer price index andor changes in the gross operating revenues of the property these escalators are not fixed so no straightline rent is recorded however rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period this lease structure will initially generate lower revenues net income and funds from operations compared to leases with fixed escalators that require straightlining but will enable us to generate additional organic growth and minimize noncash straightline rent over time this change does not affect our cash flow or our ability to pay dividends our yield on loans receivable depends upon a number of factors including the stated interest rate the average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments 

  depending upon the availability and cost of external capital we anticipate making additional investments in health care related facilities new investments are generally funded from temporary borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements internally generated cash and the proceeds from sales of real property our investments generate internal cash from rent and interest receipts and principal payments on loans receivable permanent financing for future investments which replaces funds drawn under the unsecured lines of credit arrangements is expected to be provided through a combination of public and private offerings of debt and equity securities and the incurrence of secured debt we believe our liquidity and various sources of available capital are sufficient to fund operations meet debt service obligations both principal and interest make dividend distributions and finance future investments 

  depending upon market conditions we believe that new investments will be available in the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to our stockholders during the year ended december 31 2004 we completed 584931000 of gross new investments and had 62584000 of real property sales and mortgage loan payoffs resulting in net investments of 522347000 we previously issued investment guidance indicating that we anticipated net new investments of 250000000 in 2005 we recently adjusted our net new investment guidance for 2005 to 200000000 due to the anticipated disposition of two investments totaling approximately 50000000 that were not in the original guidance although no additional investment payoffs have been specifically identified we anticipate the potential repayment of certain mortgage loans receivable and the possible sale of additional real property to the extent that mortgage loan repayments and real property sales exceed new investments our revenues and cash flows from operations could be adversely affected we expect to reinvest the proceeds from any mortgage loan repayments and real property sales in new investments to the extent that new investment requirements exceed our available cash onhand we expect to borrow under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements at december 31 2004 we had 19763000 of cash and cash equivalents and 189000000 of available borrowing capacity under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements 

   we completed the following key transactions during the year ended december 31 2004 

 

   we utilize several key performance indicators to evaluate the various aspects of our business these indicators are discussed below and relate to operating performance concentration risk and credit strength management uses these key performance indicators to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results in making operating decisions and for budget planning purposes 

  operating performance we believe that net income available to common stockholders “nics” is the most appropriate earnings measure other useful supplemental measures of our operating performance include funds from operations “ffo” and funds available for distribution “fad” however these supplemental measures are not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” please refer to the section entitled “nongaap financial measures” for further discussion of ffo and fad and for reconciliations of ffo and fad to nics nics ffo fad and their relative per share amounts are widely used by investors and analysts in the valuation comparison and investment recommendations of companies the following table reflects the recent historical trends for our operating performance measures dollars in thousands except per share data 

 36   credit strength we measure our credit strength both in terms of leverage ratios and coverage ratios our leverage ratios include debt to book capitalization “dbcr” and debt to market capitalization “dmcr” the leverage ratios indicate how much of our balance sheet capitalization is related to longterm debt we expect to maintain a dbcr between 40 and 50 and a dmcr between 30 and 40 our coverage ratios include interest coverage ratio “icr” and fixed charge coverage ratio “fcr” the coverage ratios indicate our ability to service interest and fixed charges interest plus preferred dividends we expect to maintain an icr in excess of 300 times and an fcr in excess of 250 times the coverage ratios are based on earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” which is discussed in further detail and reconciled to net income below in “nongaap financial measures” leverage ratios and coverage ratios are widely used by investors analysts and rating agencies in the valuation comparison rating and investment recommendations of companies the following table reflects the recent historical trends for our credit strength measures 

   concentration risk we evaluate our concentration risk in terms of asset mix investment mix operator mix and geographic mix concentration risk is a valuable measure in understanding what portion of our investments could be at risk if certain sectors were to experience downturns asset mix measures the portion of our investments that are real property in order to qualify as an equity reit at least 75 of our real estate investments must be real property whereby each property which includes the land buildings improvements and related rights is owned by us and leased to an operator pursuant to a longterm operating lease investment mix measures the portion of our investments that relate to our various facility types we invest primarily in longterm care facilities operator mix measures the portion of our investments that relate to our top five operators we try to limit our top five operators to 50 of our total real estate investments geographic mix measures the portion of our investments that relate to our top five states we try to limit our top five states to 50 of our total real estate investments the following table reflects our recent historical trends of concentration risk 

 37    we evaluate our key performance indicators in conjunction with current expectations to determine if historical trends are indicative of future results our expected results may not be achieved and actual results may differ materially from our expectations this may be a result of various factors including but not limited to 

 38 

   management regularly monitors the economic and other factors listed above we develop strategic and tactical plans designed to improve performance and maximize our competitive position our ability to achieve our financial objectives is dependent upon our ability to effectively execute these plans and to appropriately respond to emerging economic and companyspecific trends please refer to “forwardlooking statements and risk factors” below for further discussion of these risk factors 

   payment coverages in our portfolio continue to improve our overall payment coverage is at 178 times and represents an increase of 25 basis points from the prior year the table below is a summary of the key performance measures for our portfolio census and payor mix data reflects the three months ended september 30 2004 coverage data reflects the 12 months ended september 30 2004

  on july 30 2002 president george w bush signed into law the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 “sox” sox is designed to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures sox directed the securities and exchange commission “sec” to promulgate all necessary rules and regula 

39 tions we believe we are in compliance with all of the new listing guidelines of the nyse relating to corporate governance as well as the applicable provisions of sox and the rules of the sec adopted under sox the following is a summary of some of the important sox related corporate governance initiatives for which we are compliant

liquidity and capital resources 

   our primary sources of cash include rent and interest receipts borrowings under unsecured lines of credit arrangements public and private offerings of debt and equity securities proceeds from the sales of real property and principal payments on loans receivable our primary uses of cash include dividend distributions debt service payments including principal and interest real property acquisitions loan advances and general and administrative expenses these sources and uses of cash are reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows and are discussed in further detail below the following is a summary of our sources and uses of cash flows dollars in thousands 

   operating activities the increases in net cash provided from operating activities are primarily attributable to increases in net income and the provision for depreciation offset by changes in receivables and other assets net income and the provision for depreciation increased primarily as a result of net new investments in properties owned by us see the discussion of investing activities below for additional details to the extent that we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future our provision for depreciation will change accordingly changes in receivables and other assets are primarily due to timing of cash receipts relating to rent debt service and other contractual obligations and the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements 

41   investing activities the increases in net cash used in investing activities are primarily attributable to increases in net real property investments at december 31 2004 90 of our real estate investments were real property investments the investment activity during the year ended december 31 2004 was approximately 95 real property investments and 5 loans investments for the year ended december 31 2004 included the acquisition of 22 assisted living facilities and 52 skilled nursing facilities for 518891000 including the assumption of debt totaling 14555000 the remaining 38211000 of real property investments relates primarily to funding of construction and renovations on existing facilities of this amount 9523000 related to construction advances on two assisted living facilities for the same period in 2003 we acquired 69 assisted living facilities and 26 skilled nursing facilities for 474385000 the prior year acquisitions included the assumption of debt totaling 101243000 and the issuance of preferred stock totaling 26500000 resulting in 346643000 of cash disbursed for the acquisitions in addition we advanced 63770000 relating to construction and renovations on existing facilities of this amount 29496000 related to construction advances on three assisted living facilities and one specialty care facility we converted 36794000 of completed construction projects relating to one assisted living facility and the specialty care facility into operating lease properties in 2003 for the same period in 2002 we acquired 24 assisted living facilities 21 skilled nursing facilities and one specialty care facility for 354672000 the 2002 acquisitions included the assumption of debt which reduced the amount funded by 2248000 resulting in 352424000 of cash disbursed for the acquisitions in addition we advanced 57282000 relating to construction and renovations on existing facilities of this amount 19595000 related to construction advances on three assisted living facilities and one specialty care facility 

  financing activities the changes in net cash provided from or used in financing activities are primarily attributable to changes related to our longterm debt preferred stock issuances and redemptions common stock issuances and cash distributions to stockholders in september 2002 we issued 150000000 of 80 senior unsecured notes maturing in september 2012 at an effective yield of 805 in march 2003 we issued 100000000 of 80 senior unsecured notes maturing in september 2012 at an effective yield of 740 these notes were an addon to the 150000000 senior unsecured notes issued in september 2002 in november 2003 we issued 250000000 of 60 senior unsecured notes maturing in november 2013 at an effective yield of 601 in september 2004 we issued 50000000 of 60 senior unsecured notes maturing in november 2013 at an effective yield of 568 these notes were an addon to the 250000000 senior unsecured notes issued in november 2003 we extinguished 40000000 of 80 senior unsecured notes that matured in april 2004 

  there was no preferred stock activity for the year ended december 31 2002 in july 2003 we closed on a public offering of 4000000 shares of 7875 series d cumulative redeemable preferred stock which generated net proceeds of approximately 96850000 the shares have a liquidation value of 25 per share the preferred stock which has no stated maturity may be redeemed by us on or after july 9 2008 a portion of the proceeds from this offering were used to redeem all 3000000 shares of our 8875 series b cumulative redeemable preferred stock on july 15 2003 at a redemption price of 25 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends

42 on or after september 14 2009 the proceeds were used to repay borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements and to invest in additional health care properties 

  the change in common stock issuances is primarily attributable to public and private issuances in 2002 and 2003 in february 2002 we issued 906000 shares of common stock 1 par value at a price of 2759 per share which generated net proceeds of approximately 23657000 in may 2002 we issued 3450000 shares of common stock 1 par value at a price of 2800 per share which generated net proceeds of approximately 91578000 in november 2002 we issued 930000 shares of common stock 1 par value at a price of 2690 per share which generated net proceeds of approximately 24952000

   we have guaranteed the payment of industrial revenue bonds for one assisted living facility in the event that the present owner defaults upon its obligations in consideration for this guaranty we receive and recognize fees annually related to this arrangement this guaranty expires upon the repayment of the industrial revenue bonds which currently mature in 2009 at december 31 2004 we were contingently liable for 3195000 under this guaranty

  we are exposed to various market risks including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates we may or may not elect to use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate exposure these decisions are principally based on our policy to match our variable rate investments with comparable borrowings but are also based on the general trend in interest rates at the applicable dates and our perception of the future volatility of interest rates as of december 31 2004 we participated in two interest rate swap 

43 agreements related to our longterm debt our interest rate swaps are discussed below in “contractual obligations”

  we have 875000000 of senior unsecured notes with fixed annual interest rates ranging from 6 to 817 payable semiannually total contractual interest obligations on senior unsecured notes totaled 394191000 at december 31 2004 additionally we have 32 mortgage loans totaling 160225000 collateralized by health care facilities with fixed annual interest rates ranging from 55 to 12 payable monthly the carrying values of the health care properties securing the mortgage loans totaled 233591000 at december 31 2004 total contractual interest obligations on mortgage loans totaled 139454000 at december 31 2004

  our senior unsecured notes are rated baa3 stable bbb stable and bbb positive by moody’s investors service standard and poor’s investor service and fitch ratings respectively we plan to manage the company to maintain investment grade status with a capital structure consistent with our current profile any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the noted rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations liquidity and or financial condition

   ffo for the year ended december 31 2004 totaled 146742000 or 282 per diluted share as compared with 119463000 or 270 per diluted share for the same period in 2003 and 96573000 or 259 per diluted share for the same period in 2002 the increase in ffo is primarily due to increases in net income available to common stockholders and the provision for depreciation fad for the year ended december 31 2004 totaled 132950000 or 255 per diluted share as compared to 104535000 or 236 per diluted share for the same period in 2003 and 87317000 or 234 per diluted share for the same period in 2002 the increase in fad is primarily due to increases in net income available to common stockholders and the provision for depreciation offset by changes in rental income in excess of cash received please refer to the discussion of “nongaap financial measures” below for further information regarding ffo and fad and for reconciliations of ffo and fad to nics 

  ebitda for the year ended december 31 2004 totaled 238264000 as compared with 199349000 for the same period in 2003 and 155208000 for the same period in 2002 the increase in ebitda is primarily due to increases in net income interest expense and provision for depreciation our coverage ratio of ebitda to total interest was 324 times for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared with 350 times for the same period in 2003 and 367 times for the same period in 2002 our coverage ratio of ebitda to fixed charges was 277 times for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared with 301 times for the same period in 2003 and 284 times for the same period in 2002 our coverage ratios declined from the prior years primarily due to the fact that interest expense increased 29 to 73431000 from 56912000 in 2003 and 

46 74 from 42271000 in 2002 whereas ebitda only increased by 20 from 2003 and 54 from 2002 the increase in interest expense is discussed in further detail below please refer to the discussion of “nongaap financial measures” below for further information regarding ebitda and a reconciliation of ebitda and net income 

  revenues were comprised of the following dollars in thousands 

   the increase in gross revenues is primarily attributable to increased rental income resulting from the acquisitions of new properties for which we receive rent offset by sales of real property investments for the year ended december 31 2004 included the acquisition of 22 assisted living facilities and 52 skilled nursing facilities for 518891000 including the assumption of debt totaling 14555000 the remaining 38211000 of real property investments related primarily to funding of construction and renovations on existing facilities of this amount 9523000 related to construction advances on two assisted living facilities for the same period in 2003 we acquired 69 assisted living facilities and 26 skilled nursing facilities for 474385000 however the prior year acquisitions included the assumption of debt totaling 101243000 and the issuance of preferred stock totaling 26500000 resulting in 346643000 of cash disbursed for the acquisitions in addition we advanced 63770000 relating to construction and renovations on existing facilities of this amount 29496000 related to construction advances on three assisted living facilities and one specialty care facility we converted 36794000 of completed construction projects relating to one assisted living facility and the specialty care facility into operating lease properties in 2003 for the same period in 2002 we acquired 24 assisted living facilities 21 skilled nursing facilities and one specialty care facility for 354672000 however the 2002 acquisitions included the assumption of debt which reduced the amount funded by 2248000 resulting in 352424000 of cash disbursed for the acquisitions in addition we advanced 57282000 relating to construction and renovations on existing facilities of this amount 19595000 related to construction advances on three assisted living facilities and one specialty care facility during the year ended december 31 2004 we sold four assisted living facilities two skilled nursing facilities and one specialty care facility generating 37567000 of net proceeds for the same period in 2003 we sold 14 assisted living facilities two skilled nursing facilities and one parcel of land generating 65455000 of net proceeds for the same period in 2002 we sold nine assisted living facilities generating 52279000 of net proceeds 

  as discussed above prior to june 2004 our standard lease structure contained fixed annual rental escalators which were generally recognized on a straightline basis over the minimum lease period beginning in june 2004 our new standard lease structure contains annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the consumer price index andor changes in the gross operating revenues of the property these escalators are not fixed so no straightline rent is recorded however rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period while this change does not affect our cash flow or our ability to pay dividends it is anticipated that we will generate additional organic growth and minimize noncash straightline rent over time if gross operating revenues at our facilities andor the consumer price index do not increase a portion of our revenues may not continue to increase sales of real property would offset revenue increases and to the extent that they exceed new acquisitions could result in decreased revenues our leases could renew above or below current rent rates resulting in an increase or decrease in rental income as of december 31 2004 we had no leases expiring prior to 2009 

47   interest income decreased from 2002 primarily due to lower average yields on our loans receivable and nonrecognition of interest income related to loans on nonaccrual interest income increased from 2003 primarily due to a full year of interest income on loans made in 2003 and recognition of interest income related to our mortgage loans with doctors community healthcare corporation as a result of the bankruptcy resolution transaction fees and other income fluctuated primarily due to the 902000 gain from the sale of our investment in atlantic healthcare finance lp in october 2003 and the resulting lack of income subsequent to the date of sale 

  expenses were comprised of the following dollars in thousands 

   the increase in total expenses is primarily attributable to increases in interest expense the provision for depreciation and general and administrative expenses the increases in interest expense are primarily due to higher average borrowings and changes in the amount of capitalized interest offsetting interest expense this was partially offset by lower average interest rates and savings generated from interest rate swap agreements in september 2002 we issued 150000000 of 80 senior unsecured notes maturing in september 2012 at an effective yield of 805 resulting in 12 months of expense in the current year as compared to three months of expense in 2002 and 12 months of expense in 2003 in march 2003 we issued 100000000 of 80 senior unsecured notes maturing in september 2012 at an effective yield of 740 resulting in nine months of interest expense in 2003 compared to 12 months of expense in the current year in november 2003 we issued 250000000 of 60 senior unsecured notes maturing in november 2013 resulting in 12 months of expense in the current year as compared to no expense in 2002 and one month of expense in 2003 in september 2004 we issued 50000000 of 60 senior unsecured notes maturing in november 2013 at an effective yield of 568 resulting in three months of expense in the current year as compared to no expense in the prior years additionally during the year ended december 31 2004 we had an average daily outstanding balance of 54770000 under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements compared to 61677000 and 69180000 during the same periods in 2003 and 2002 respectively also in 2004 we assumed 14555000 of secured debt with weighted average interest rates of 750 in conjunction with new acquisitions in 2003 we assumed 101243000 of secured debt with weighted average interest rates of 739 in conjunction with new acquisitions in 2002 we assumed 2248000 of secured debt with weighted average interest rates of 775 in conjunction with new acquisitions effective april 15 2004 we repaid our 40000000 80 senior unsecured notes which will result in a decrease of interest expense of 3200000 on an annualized basis if we borrow under our unsecured lines of credit arrangements issue additional senior unsecured notes or assume additional secured debt our interest expense will increase 

  we capitalize certain interest costs associated with funds used to finance the construction of properties owned directly by us the amount capitalized is based upon the borrowings outstanding during the construction period using the rate of interest that approximates our cost of financing our interest expense is reduced by the amount capitalized capitalized interest for the years ended december 31 2002 2003 and 2004 totaled 170000 1535000 and 875000 respectively 

48   on may 6 2004 we entered into two interest rate swap agreements the “swaps” for a total notional amount of 100000000 to hedge changes in fair value attributable to changes in the libor swap rate of 100000000 of fixed rate debt with a maturity date of november 15 2013 the swaps are treated as fairvalue hedges for accounting purposes and we utilize the shortcut method in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended the swaps are with highly rated counterparties in which we receive a fixed rate of 60 and pay a variable rate based on sixmonth libor plus a spread for the year ended december 31 2004 we generated 1770000 of savings related to our swaps that was recorded as a reduction of interest expense we had no interest rate swap agreements outstanding at december 31 2003 or december 31 2002 

  the provision for depreciation increased primarily as a result of additional investments in properties owned directly by us offset by sales of real property see the discussion of rental income above for additional details to the extent that we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future our provision for depreciation will change accordingly 

  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues including revenues from discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2004 were 654 as compared with 555 and 579 for the same periods in 2003 and 2002 respectively approximately onehalf of the increases from 2002 and 2003 are related to costs associated with our initiatives to attract and retain appropriate personnel to achieve our business objectives the remainder is comprised of increases relating to professional services fees including costs associated with sox compliance taxes and transition costs associated with the removal of an underperforming operator in december 2004 

  the increase in loan expense was primarily due to the additional amortization of costs related to amending our primary unsecured line of credit arrangement costs related to obtaining consents to modify the covenant packages of our senior unsecured notes and costs related to senior unsecured notes issued in 2003 and 2004 

  in may 2003 we announced the amendment and extension of our primary unsecured line of credit arrangement the line of credit was expanded to 225000000 and extended to expire in may 2006 with the ability to extend for one year at our discretion if we are in compliance with all covenants in august 2003 we further amended the line of credit to modify certain financial covenants that enhanced our financial flexibility and aligned our covenant package with other investmentgrade reits finally in december 2003 and january 2004 we expanded this line of credit to 310000000 

  in august and september 2003 we solicited the consents of registered holders of our senior unsecured notes to the adoption of certain amendments to the supplemental indentures to modify the indentures to require us to a limit the use of secured debt to 40 of undepreciated assets b limit total debt to 60 of undepreciated total assets and c maintain total unencumbered assets at 150 of total unsecured debt these amendments to all of our then outstanding senior unsecured notes were intended to modernize the covenant package and make it consistent with other investmentgrade reits 

  during the year ended december 31 2004 it was determined that the projected undiscounted cash flows from a property did not exceed its related net book value and an impairment charge of 314000 was recorded to reduce the property to its estimated fair market value the estimated fair market value was determined by an offer to purchase received from a third party during the year ended december 31 2003 it was determined that the projected undiscounted cash flows from a property did not exceed its related net book value and an impairment charge of 2792000 was recorded to reduce the property to its estimated fair market value the estimated fair market value of the property was determined by an independent appraisal during the year ended december 31 2002 it was determined that the projected undiscounted cash flows from three properties did not exceed their related net book values and impairment charges of 2298000 were recorded to reduce the properties to their estimated fair market values the estimated fair market values of the properties were determined by offers to purchase received from third parties or estimated net sales proceeds 

49   in april 2002 we purchased 35000000 of our outstanding senior unsecured notes that were due in 2003 and recorded a charge of 403000 in connection with this early extinguishment no such transactions or charges occurred in 2003 or 2004 

  the provision for loan losses is related to our critical accounting estimate for the allowance for loan losses and is discussed below in “critical accounting policies” due to collectibility concerns related to portions of our loan portfolio we increased our allowance for losses on loans receivable by an additional 1870000 for the year ended december 31 2003 

  other items were comprised of the following dollars in thousands 

   during the years ended december 31 2002 2003 and 2004 we sold properties with carrying values of 53311000 61316000 and 37710000 for net losses of 1032000 net gains of 4139000 and net losses of 143000 respectively in august 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2001 we adopted the standard effective january 1 2002 in accordance with statement no 144 we have reclassified the income and expenses attributable to the properties sold subsequent to january 1 2002 to discontinued operations these properties generated 7207000 4088000 and 641000 of income after deducting depreciation and interest expense from rental revenue for the years ended december 31 2002 2003 and 2004 respectively please refer to note 15 of our audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  the increase in preferred dividends is primarily due to the increase in average outstanding preferred shares we issued 3000000 shares of 8875 series b cumulative redeemable preferred stock in may 1998 and 3000000 shares of 90 series c cumulative convertible preferred stock in january 1999 we issued 4000000 shares of 7875 series d cumulative redeemable preferred stock in july 2003 and used the proceeds to redeem our outstanding series b preferred stock we issued 7000000 shares of 7625 series f cumulative redeemable preferred stock in september 2004 during the year ended december 31 2002 the holder of our series c preferred stock converted 900000 shares into 878049 shares of our common stock leaving 2100000 of such shares outstanding at december 31 2002 during the year ended december 31 2003 the holder of our series c preferred stock converted 2100000 shares into 2048781 shares of our common stock leaving no such shares outstanding at december 31 2003 we issued 1060000 shares of 6 series e cumulative convertible and redeemable preferred stock in september 2003 during the year ended december 31 2003 certain holders of our series e preferred stock converted 229556 shares into 175714 shares of our common stock leaving 830444 of such shares outstanding at december 31 2003 during the year ended december 31 2004 certain holders of our series e preferred stock converted 480399 shares into 367724 shares of our common stock leaving 350045 of such shares outstanding at december 31 2004 

  as noted above in july 2003 we closed a public offering of 4000000 shares of 7875 series d cumulative redeemable preferred stock a portion of the proceeds from this offering were used to redeem all 3000000 shares of our 8875 series b cumulative redeemable preferred stock on july 15 2003 in accordance with emerging issues task force “eitf” topic d42 the costs to issue these securities were recorded as a noncash nonrecurring charge of 2790000 or 006 per diluted share in the third quarter of 

50 2003 to reduce net income available to common stockholders no such transactions or charges occurred in 2002 or 2004 

nongaap financial measures 

  we believe that net income as defined by us gaap is the most appropriate earnings measurement however we consider ffo and fad to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with us gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation however since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient in response the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” created ffo as a supplemental measure of operating performance for reits that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income ffo as defined by nareit means net income computed in accordance with us gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures fad represents ffo excluding the noncash straightline rental adjustments additionally our historical results include an adjustment for a preferred stock redemption charge for the year ended december 31 2003 but exclude adjustments for impairment charges 

  in august 2003 we adopted the sec clarification of eitf topic d42 to implement the clarified accounting pronouncement our 2003 results reflect a reduction in net income available to common stockholders resulting from a noncash nonrecurring charge of 2790000 or 006 per diluted share due to the redemption of our 8875 series b cumulative redeemable preferred stock in july 2003 nareit has issued its recommendation that preferred stock redemption charges should not be added back to net income in the calculation of ffo although we have adopted this recommendation we have also disclosed ffo and fad adjusted for the preferred stock redemption charge for enhanced clarity additionally we believe that the nature of the charge is nonrecurring because there was not a similar charge during the two preceding years and we do not anticipate a similar charge in the succeeding two years 

  in october 2003 nareit informed its member companies that the sec had changed its position on certain aspects of the nareit ffo definition including impairment charges previously the sec accepted nareit’s view that impairment charges were effectively an early recognition of an expected loss on an impending sale of property and thus should be added back to net income in the calculation of ffo and fad similar to other gains and losses on sales however the sec’s clarified interpretation is that recurring impairments taken on real property may not be added back to net income in the calculation of ffo and fad we have adopted this interpretation and have not added back impairment charges of 2298000 or 006 per diluted share recorded for the year ended december 31 2002 2792000 or 006 per diluted share recorded for the year ended december 31 2003 and 314000 or 001 per diluted share recorded for the year ended december 31 2004 

  ebitda stands for earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization additionally we exclude the noncash provision for loan losses in calculating ebitda we believe that ebitda along with net income and cash flow provided from operating activities is an important supplemental measure because it provides additional information to assess and evaluate the performance of our operations additionally restrictive covenants in our longterm debt arrangements contain financial ratios based on ebitda we primarily utilize ebitda to measure our interest coverage ratio which represents ebitda divided by total interest and our fixed charge coverage ratio which represents ebitda divided by fixed charges fixed charges include total interest and preferred dividends 

  ffo fad and ebitda are financial measures that are widely used by investors equity and debt analysts and rating agencies in the valuation comparison rating and investment recommendations of companies management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results in making operating decisions and for budget planning purposes additionally ffo and fad are internal evaluation metrics utilized by the board of directors to evaluate management ffo fad and ebitda do not represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as 

51 determined in accordance with us gaap and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity finally ffo fad and ebitda as defined by us may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies 

  the table below reflects the reconciliation of ffo to net income available to common stockholders the most directly comparable us gaap measure for the periods presented the provision for depreciation includes provision for depreciation from discontinued operations amounts are in thousands except for per share data

 critical accounting policies 

  our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap which requires us to make estimates and assumptions management considers an accounting estimate or assumption critical if 

   management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate and are not reasonably likely to change in the future however since these estimates require assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made they bear the risk of change if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations liquidity andor financial condition please refer to note 1 of our audited consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact us there have been no 

54 material changes to these policies in 2004 except for the new policy regarding the fair value of derivative instruments 

  we adopted the fair valuebased method of accounting for sharebased payments effective january 1 2003 using the prospective method described in fasb statement no 148 accounting for stockbased compensation — transition and disclosure because statement 123r must be applied not only to new awards but to previously granted awards that are not fully vested on the effective date of statement 123r and because we adopted statement 123 using the prospective transition method which applied only to awards granted modified or settled after the adoption date of statement 123 compensation cost for some previously granted awards that were not recognized under statement 123 will be recognized under statement 123r however had we adopted statement 123r in prior periods the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note 9 to our audited consolidated financial statements we do not expect the adoption of statement 123r to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 

  the following table presents information about our critical accounting policies as well as the material assumptions used to develop each estimate 

 55  impact of inflation 

  during the past three years inflation has not significantly affected our earnings because of the moderate inflation rate additionally our earnings are primarily longterm investments with fixed rates of return these investments are mainly financed with a combination of equity senior unsecured notes and borrowings under our lines of credit arrangements during inflationary periods which generally are accompanied by rising interest rates our ability to grow may be adversely affected because the yield on new investments may increase at a slower rate than new borrowing costs presuming the current inflation rate remains moderate and longterm interest rates do not increase significantly we believe that inflation will not impact the availability of equity and debt financing

   our skilled nursing and specialty care facility operators’ revenues are primarily driven by occupancy medicare and medicaid reimbursement and private pay rates our assisted living facility operators’ revenues are primarily driven by occupancy and private pay rates expenses for these three types of facilities are primarily driven by the costs of labor food utilities taxes insurance and rent or debt service revenues from government reimbursement have and may continue to come under pressure due to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls liability insurance and staffing costs continue to increase for our operators to the extent that any decrease in revenues andor any increase in operating expenses result in a facility not generating enough cash to make payments to us the credit of our operator and the value of other collateral would have to be relied upon 

   we are exposed to the risk that our operators may not be able to meet the rent principal and interest or other payments due us which may result in an operator bankruptcy or insolvency or that an operator might become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings for other reasons although our operating lease agreements provide us the right to evict an operator demand immediate payment of rent and exercise other remedies and our mortgage loans provide us the right to terminate any funding obligation demand immediate repayment of principal and unpaid interest foreclose on the collateral and exercise other remedies the bankruptcy laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization an operator in bankruptcy may be able to limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent in the case of a lease or to receive unpaid principal and interest in the case of a mortgage loan and to exercise other rights and remedies 

  we may be required to fund certain expenses eg real estate taxes and maintenance to preserve the value of a facility avoid the imposition of liens on a facility andor transition a facility to a new operator in some instances we have terminated our lease with an operator and relet the facility to another operator in some of those situations we provided working capital loans to and limited indemnification of the new operator if we cannot transition a leased facility to a new operator we may take possession of that facility which may expose us to certain successor liabilities should such events occur our revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely affected see “item 3 — legal proceedings” above 

   our operators’ businesses are affected by government reimbursement and private payor rates to the extent that any skilled nursing or specialty care facility receives a significant portion of its revenues from governmental payors primarily medicare and medicaid such revenues may be subject to statutory and regulatory changes retroactive rate adjustments recovery of program overpayments or setoffs administrative rulings policy interpretations payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries government funding restrictions at a program level or with respect to specific facilities and interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing governmental investigations and audits at such facility in recent years governmental payors have frozen or reduced payments to health care providers due to budgetary pressures changes in health care reimbursement will likely continue to be of paramount importance to federal and state authorities we cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or effect any future legislative reforms may have on the financial condition of the skilled nursing industry the specialty care industry or the health care industry in general there can be no assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will continue to be available for services provided by any facility operator whether the facility receives reimbursement from medicare medicaid or private payors significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on an operator’s liquidity financial condition and results of operations which could adversely affect the ability of an operator to meet its obligations to us in addition the replacement of an operator that has defaulted on its lease or loan could be delayed by the approval process of any federal state or local agency necessary for the transfer of the facility or the replacement of the operator licensed to manage the facility see “item 1 — business — certain government regulations — reimbursement” above 

   longterm care facility operators assisted living and skilled nursing facilities have experienced substantial increases in both the number and size of patient care liability claims in recent years particularly in the states of texas and florida as a result general and professional liability costs have increased and may continue to increase nationwide longterm care liability insurance rates are increasing because of large jury awards in states like texas and florida over the past two years both texas and florida have adopted skilled nursing facility liability laws that modify or limit tort damages despite some of these reforms the longterm care industry overall continues to experience very high general and professional liability costs insurance companies have responded to this claims crisis by severely restricting their capacity to write longterm care general and professional liability policies no assurances can be given that the climate for longterm care general and professional liability insurance will improve in any of the foregoing states or any other states where the facility operators conduct business insurance companies may continue to reduce or stop writing general and professional liability policies for assisted living and skilled nursing facilities thus general professional liability insurance coverage may be restricted or very costly which may adversely affect the facility operators’ future operations cash flows and financial condition and may have a material adverse effect on the facility operators’ ability to meet their obligations to us 

   we are exposed to the risk that our future acquisitions may not prove to be successful we could encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired properties including contingent liabilities and newly acquired properties might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business if we agree to provide construction funding to an operator and the project is not completed we may need to take steps to ensure completion of the project or we could lose the property moreover if we issue equity securities or incur additional debt or both to finance future acquisitions it may reduce our per share financial results these costs may negatively affect our results of operations 

   under various federal and state laws owners or operators of real estate may be required to respond to the release of hazardous substances on the property and may be held liable for property damage personal injuries or penalties that result from environmental contamination these laws also expose us to the possibility that we may become liable to reimburse the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination generally such liability attaches to a person based on the person’s relationship to the property our tenants or borrowers are primarily responsible for the condition of the property and since we are a passive landlord we do not “participate in the management” of any property in which we have an interest moreover we review environmental site assessments of the properties that we own or encumber prior to taking an interest in them those assessments are designed to meet the “all appropriate inquiry” standard which qualifies us for the innocent purchaser defense if environmental liabilities arise based upon such assessments we do not believe that any of our properties are subject to material environmental contamination however environmental liabilities may be present in our properties and we may incur costs to remediate contamination which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition 

   from time to time we will have cash available from 1 the proceeds of sales of our securities 2 principal payments on our loans receivable and 3 the sale of properties including nonelective dispositions under the terms of master leases or similar financial support arrangements we must reinvest these proceeds on a timely basis in health care investments or in qualified shortterm investments we compete for real estate investments with a broad variety of potential investors this competition for attractive investments may negatively affect our ability to make timely investments on terms acceptable to us delays in acquiring properties may negatively impact revenues and perhaps our ability to make distributions to stockholders 

   we are also subject to a number of risks on the corporate level first we might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a reit we intend to operate as a reit under the internal revenue code and believe we have and will continue to operate in such a manner since reit qualification requires us to meet a number of complex requirements it is possible that we may fail to fulfill them and if we do our earnings will be reduced by the amount of federal taxes owed a reduction in our earnings would affect the amount we could distribute to our stockholders also if we were not a reit we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders since a nonreit is not required to pay dividends to stockholders amounting to at least 90 of its annual taxable income see “item 1 — business — taxation” for a discussion of the provisions of the internal revenue code that apply to us and the effects of nonqualification 

  second our second restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain antitakeover provisions staggered board provisions restrictions on share ownership and transfer and super majority stockholder approval requirements for business combinations that could make it more difficult for or even prevent a third party from acquiring us without the approval of our incumbent board of directors provisions and agreements that inhibit or discourage takeover attempts could reduce the market value of our common stock 

  third we are dependent on key personnel although we have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers losing any one of them could at least temporarily have an adverse impact on our operations we believe that losing more than one would have a material adverse impact on our business

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   we are exposed to various market risks including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates we seek to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates by matching the terms of new investments with new longterm fixed rate borrowings to the extent possible we may or may not elect to use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate exposure these decisions are principally based on our policy to match our variable rate investments with comparable borrowings but are also based on the general trend in interest rates at the applicable dates and our perception of the future volatility of interest rates the following section is presented to provide a discussion of the risks associated with potential fluctuations in interest rates 

  we historically borrow on our unsecured lines of credit arrangements to make acquisitions of loans to or to construct health care facilities then as market conditions dictate we will issue equity or longterm fixed rate debt to repay the borrowings under the unsecured lines of credit arrangements 

  a change in interest rates will not affect the interest expense associated with our fixed rate debt interest rate changes however will affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt a 1 increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in fair value of our senior unsecured notes by approximately 28025000 at december 31 2004 31473000 at december 31 2003 changes in the interest rate environment upon maturity of this fixed rate debt could have an effect on our future cash flows and earnings depending on whether the debt is replaced with other fixed rate debt variable rate debt or equity or repaid by the sale of assets 

  on may 6 2004 we entered into two interest rate swap agreements the “swaps” for a total notional amount of 100000000 to hedge changes in fair value attributable to changes in the libor swap rate of 100000000 of fixed rate debt with a maturity date of november 15 2013 the swaps are treated as fairvalue hedges for accounting purposes and we utilize the shortcut method in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended the swaps are with highly rated counterparties in which we receive a fixed rate of 60 and pay a variable rate based on sixmonth libor plus a spread at december 31 2004 the swaps were reported at their fair value as a 4206000 other asset a 1 increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in fair value of our swaps by approximately 7382000 at december 31 2004 we had no interest rate swap agreements outstanding at december 31 2003 

  our variable rate debt including our unsecured lines of credit arrangements is reflected at fair value at december 31 2004 we had 151000000 outstanding related to our variable rate debt and assuming no changes in outstanding balances a 1 increase in interest rates would result in increased annual interest expense of 1510000 at december 31 2003 we did not have any borrowings outstanding related to our variable rate debt and assuming no changes in outstanding balances a 1 increase in interest rates would have had no effect on annual interest expense 

  we are subject to risks associated with debt financing including the risk that existing indebtedness may not be refinanced or that the terms of refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of current indebtedness the majority of our borrowings were completed under indentures or contractual agreements that limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur accordingly in the event that we are unable to raise additional equity or borrow money because of these limitations our ability to acquire additional properties may be limited

  assisted living facilities

     an   assisted  living  facility  is   a  special  combination  of  housing
personalized supportive services and health  care services designed to meet  the
needs    both  scheduled  and  unscheduled   of  those  who  need  help with
activities of daily living  certain of our  assisted living facilities  include
other  care  levels including  independent living  dementia care  and nursing
services more intensive medical  needs of the  resident within assisted  living

facilities  may be provided by home health providers assisted living facilities
represent less costly and less  institutionallike alternatives for the care  of
the elderly or the frail

  skilled nursing facilities

     skilled  nursing facilities provide inpatient  skilled nursing and personal
care services as  well as rehabilitative  restorative and transitional  medical
services in some instances skilled nursing facilities supplement hospital care
by  providing specialized care  for medically complex  patients whose conditions
require intense medical and therapeutic  services but who are medically  stable
enough  to have  these services provided  in facilities that  are less expensive
than acute care hospitals

  specialty care facilities

     our specialty care facilities include acute care hospitals longterm acute
care hospitals and other specialty care hospitals acute care hospitals  provide
a wide range of inpatient and outpatient services including but not limited to
surgery rehabilitation therapy and clinical laboratories longterm acute care
hospitals   provide  inpatient  services  for   patients  with  complex  medical
conditions that require  more intensive  care monitoring  or emergency  support
than  that available  in most skilled  nursing facilities  other specialty care
hospitals provide  specialized inpatient  and outpatient  services for  specific
illnesses  or diseases  including among  others orthopedic  neurosurgical and
behavioral care

investments

     we invest in health care facilities with a primary focus on longterm  care
facilities  which include  skilled nursing  and assisted  living facilities we
also invest in specialty care facilities we diversify our investment  portfolio
by operator and geographic location

     in  determining whether to invest in a facility we focus on the following
a the  experience of  the  tenants or  borrowers  management team  b  the
historical  and projected financial and operational performance of the facility
c the credit  of the tenant  or borrower d  the security for  the lease  or
loan  and e the capital committed to  the facility by the tenant or borrower
we conduct  market  research and  analysis  for all  potential  investments  in
addition  we review the  value of all  facilities the interest  rates and debt
service coverage requirements  of any  debt to  be assumed  and the  anticipated
sources for repayment of any debt

     our  investments  are primarily  real  property leased  to  operators under
operating leases and  mortgage loans  construction financing  is provided  but
only  as part  of a  longterm operating  lease or  mortgage loan  we typically
invest in or finance up to 90 of the stabilized appraised value of a  property
economic  terms normally  include annual  rate increases  and fair  market value
based purchase options in operating leases depending upon market conditions we
believe that appropriate new  investments will be available  in the future  with
spreads  over our cost of capital that  will generate appropriate returns to our
stockholders operating leases and mortgage  loans are normally credit  enhanced
by  guaranties  andor  letters of  credit  in addition  operating  leases are
typically  structured  as  master  leases  and  mortgage  loans  are   generally
crossdefaulted  and crosscollateralized  with other  mortgage loans operating
leases or agreements between us and the operator and its affiliates

     at december 31 2003 80 of our owned real property was subject to  master
leases  a master lease is a lease of  multiple facilities from us to one tenant
entity under  a  single lease  agreement  from time  to  time we  may  acquire
additional facilities that are then leased to the tenant under the master lease
the  tenant is required to make one  monthly payment that represents rent on all
the properties that are subject to the master lease typically the master lease
tenant can exercise its right to purchase the facilities or to renew the  master
lease  only  with  respect to  all  leased  facilities at  the  same  time this
bundling feature benefits us because the  tenant cannot limit the purchase  or
renewal   to  the  better  performing   facilities  and  terminate  the  leasing
arrangement with respect to the  poorer performing facilities this spreads  our
risk  among the entire group of facilities within the master lease the bundling
feature may  provide  a similar  advantage  if the  master  lease tenant  is  in
bankruptcy  subject to  certain restrictions  a debtor  in bankruptcy  has the
right to assume or reject

                                        4

each of its leases it is our intent that a tenant who is in bankruptcy would be
required to assume or reject the master lease as a whole rather than making the
decision on a facility by facility basis

     we monitor our investments through a  variety of methods determined by  the
type  of  health care  facility and  operator  our monitoring  process includes
review of monthly financial  statements for each  facility quarterly review  of
operator  credit annual facility inspections  and review of covenant compliance
relating  to  licensure  real  estate  taxes  letters  of  credit  and   other
collateral  in  monitoring  our  portfolio  our  personnel  use  a proprietary
database to collect and analyze facilityspecific data additionally we conduct
extensive research to ascertain industry trends and risks

     through monitoring and research we  evaluate the operating environment  in
each  facilitys market to determine whether payment risk is likely to increase
when we  identify unacceptable  levels of  payment risk  we seek  to  mitigate
eliminate  or transfer the  risk we typically categorize  the risk as operator
facility or  market risk  for operator  risk we  typically find  a  substitute
operator  to  run the  facility for  facility  risk we  usually work  with the
operator to institute  facility level  management changes to  address the  risk
finally  for market risk we often encourage  an operator to change its capital
structure including  refinancing or  raising additional  equity through  these
monitoring  and research efforts we are typically able to intervene at an early
stage and address payment risk and in so doing support both the collectibility
of revenue and the value of our investment

  operating leases

     each facility which includes the land buildings improvements and related
rights owned by us is leased to  an operator pursuant to a longterm  operating
lease  as discussed above most of our  leased properties are subject to master
leases the leases generally have a fixed term of seven to 15 years and  contain
one or more five to 15year renewal options each lease is a net lease requiring
the  tenant to pay rent and all  additional charges incurred in the operation of
the leased property the  tenants are required to  repair rebuild and  maintain
the leased properties

     the  net value of our  completed leased properties aggregated approximately
1726836000 at december 31 2003  operating lease income generally  includes
base  rent  payments  plus  fixed annual  rent  increases  which  are generally
recognized on a straightline  basis over the minimum  lease period this  lease
income  is greater than the amount of cash received during the first half of the
lease term in some instances representing approximately 21 of real property
the leases  provide  for additional  payment  of  rent if  the  gross  operating
revenues  from the property  exceed a predetermined  threshold revenues are not
recognized until these thresholds have been met rents as recognized using  the
straightline  method  where  applicable on  the  original lease  basis  of our
completed leased  properties are  approximately 115  per annum  on average  at
december  31  2003 our  rental  yield from  leases  depends upon  a  number of
factors  including  the  initial  rent  charged  upfront  fees  any   rental
adjustments  and in some cases facilitylevel  revenue the base rents for the
renewal periods are generally fixed rents set at the greater of a minimum agreed
upon rate of return or a spread  above the treasury yield for the  corresponding
period  generally with  a floor  of the  prior years  rate of  return plus the
annual increaser

     we currently provide for the construction of facilities for the tenants  as
part  of  longterm  operating  leases  we  capitalize  certain  interest costs
associated with  funds used  to  finance the  construction of  properties  owned
directly  by us  the amount capitalized  is based upon  the balance outstanding
during the construction period using the rate of interest that approximates  our
cost of financing our interest expense is reduced by the amount capitalized we
also typically charge a transaction fee at the commencement of construction the
construction  period commences upon  funding and terminates  upon the earlier of
the completion of  the applicable  facility or the  end of  a specified  period
generally  12 to 18 months during the  construction period we advance funds to
the operator in accordance with agreed upon terms and conditions which  require
among  other  things a  site visit  by  a company  representative prior  to the
advancement of  funds  during the  construction  period we  generally  require
additional  credit  enhancement in  the form  of  payment and  performance bonds

financings  of 14865000 14701000  for leased properties  and 164000 for
construction loans  and were  committed to  providing additional  financing  of
approximately 15501000 to complete construction

  mortgage loans

     our  investments in mortgage  loans are typically  structured to provide us
with interest  income  principal  amortization and  transaction  fees  and  are
generally secured by a first or second mortgage lien or leasehold mortgage

     at  december 31 2003 the interest  rates averaged approximately 111 per
annum on our  outstanding mortgage loan  balances our yield  on mortgage  loans
depends  upon a number  of factors including the  stated interest rate average
principal amount outstanding during the term  of the loan and any interest  rate
adjustments

     the mortgage loans made through december 31 2003 are generally subject to
three  to  20year terms  with principal  amortization schedules  andor balloon
payment of the outstanding principal balance at the end of the term  generally
the mortgage loans provide three to eight years of prepayment protection

  working capital loans

     working  capital loans are shortterm loans made to operators of facilities
and are typically either secured andor guaranteed these instruments have terms
ranging from  three months  to ten  years  at december  31 2003  the  average
interest rates excluding any loans on nonaccrual were approximately 107 per
annum on our outstanding working capital loan balances at december 31 2003 we
had provided working capital loans to nine operators

  subdebt investments

     subdebt  investments  are loans  made to  operators  of facilities  and are
generally secured by the operators  leasehold rights and corporate  guaranties
generally  these instruments are for four  to sevenyear terms at december 31
2003 the  average interest  rates were  approximately 120  per annum  on  our
outstanding  subdebt investment balances at december  31 2003 we had provided
subdebt financing to five operators

  equity investments

     we had an investment in atlantic healthcare finance lp a property  group
that  specializes in the financing through  sale and leaseback transactions of
nursing and  care homes  located  in the  united  kingdom this  investment  was
accounted  for under the equity method of  accounting because we had the ability
to exercise significant influence but not control over the company due to  our
31  ownership interest  in october  2003 we  sold our  investment in atlantic
healthcare finance lp generating a net gain of 902000

     other equity  investments  which consist  of  investments in  private  and
public companies for which we do not have the ability to exercise influence are
accounted  for  under the  cost  method under  the  cost method  of accounting
investments in private companies are carried  at cost and are adjusted only  for
otherthantemporary  declines  in  fair value  distributions  of  earnings and
additional investments for  investments in public  companies that have  readily
determinable   fair  market  values  we  classify  our  equity  investments  as
availableforsale and  accordingly record  these  investments at  their  fair
market  values with  unrealized gains and  losses included  in accumulated other
comprehensive income  a  separate  component  of  stockholders  equity  these
investments represent a minimal ownership interest in these companies

certain government regulations

  health law matters  generally

     we  invest  in  assisted  living   skilled  nursing  and  specialty   care
facilities  which represent approximately 60 32 and 8 respectively of our
investments at december 31 2003

     typically  operators  of  assisted   living  facilities  do  not   receive
significant  funding from governmental programs and are regulated by the states
not the  federal government  operators of  skilled nursing  and specialty  care
facilities  are subject  to federal  and state laws  that regulate  the type and
quality of the medical andor  nursing care provided ancillary services  eg
respiratory  occupational physical and  infusion therapies qualifications of
the administrative personnel  and nursing  staff the adequacy  of the  physical
plant  and equipment  distribution of  pharmaceuticals reimbursement  and rate
setting and operating  policies in addition  as described below  some of  our
facility  operators are subject to extensive  laws and regulations pertaining to
health care fraud and abuse  including kickbacks physician selfreferrals  and
false claims

  licensing and certification

     the  primary  regulations that  affect assisted  living facilities  are the
states licensing laws in granting and renewing these licenses the  regulatory
authorities  consider numerous factors  relating to a  facilitys physical plant
and operations including but not limited to admission and discharge  standards
and  staffing  and training  a decision  to grant  or renew  a license  is also
affected by a facilitys record with  respect to consumer rights and  medication
guidelines and rules

     generally  our skilled nursing and  specialty care facilities are required
to be  licensed  on  an annual  or  biannual  basis and  to  be  certified  for
participation  in  the  medicare  and medicaid  programs  these  facilities are
subject to  audits and  surveys by  various regulatory  agencies that  determine
compliance  with  federal state  and local  laws the  failure of  our facility
operators to maintain or  renew any required license  or regulatory approval  or
serious  survey deficiencies could prevent them  from continuing operations at a
property in  addition  if a  facility  is found  out  of compliance  with  the
conditions of participation in medicare medicaid or other health care programs
or  if a facility is otherwise excluded from those programs the facility may be
barred from participation  in government  reimbursement programs  any of  these
occurrences may impair the ability of our operators to meet their obligations to
us  if  we have  to replace  a facility  operator our  ability to  replace the
operator may  be affected  by federal  and state  rules and  policies  governing
changes  in control under  current medicare and  medicaid rules and regulations
and provider contracts a successor  operator that assumes an existing  provider
agreement  will  typically be  subject to  certain  liabilities of  the previous
operator including overpayments  terms under any  existing plan of  correction
and  possibly sanctions and penalties if  a successor operator chooses to apply
for a new medicare  andor medicaid provider  agreement the successor  operator
may  experience interruptions and delays  in reimbursement during the processing
of its application for a  new provider agreement or  its application may not  be
approved  this may result in payment delays an inability to find a replacement
operator a significant working capital commitment from us to a new operator  or
other difficulties

  reimbursement

     assisted living facilities  approximately 57 of our revenues for the year
ended  december 31 2003  were attributable to  assisted living facilities the
majority of  the revenues  received  by the  operators  of our  assisted  living
facilities  are  from  private  pay sources  the  remaining  revenue  source is
primarily  medicaid  waiver  programs  fortyone  states  currently  have  such
programs  which allow medicaid  recipients to use  benefits for alternatives to
skilled nursing such as  assisted living and home  health the national  academy
for  state  health  policy reports  that  medicaid waiver  programs  serve about
102000 residents in assisted living  or residential care settings at  december
31   2003  12   of  our  31   assisted  living   operators  utilized  medicaid

                                        8
page

waivers for the year ended december 31 2003 approximately 5 of the  revenues
at our assisted living facilities were from medicaid reimbursement

     rates  paid by selfpay residents are set by the facilities and are largely
determined by local market conditions and operating costs generally facilities
receive a higher payment per day for a private pay resident than for a  medicaid
beneficiary  who  requires a  comparable level  of care  the level  of medicaid
reimbursement varies from state to state but rarely includes reimbursement  for
room and board thus the revenues generated by operators of our assisted living
facilities  may be adversely affected by payor  mix acuity level and changes in
medicaid eligibility and reimbursement levels changes in revenues could in turn
have a material adverse effect on  an operators ability to meet its  obligation
to us

     skilled  nursing facilities and specialty care facilities  skilled nursing
and specialty  care facilities  typically receive  most of  their revenues  from
medicare  and  medicaid with  the balance  representing private  pay including
private insurance consequently skilled  nursing and specialty care  facilities
rely   heavily  on  government  reimbursement   changes  in  federal  or  state
reimbursement policies  including  changes in  payment  rates as  a  result  of
federal  or state regulatory action or  payment delays by fiscal intermediaries
may also adversely affect an operators ability to cover its expenses including
our rent or  debt service  skilled nursing  and specialty  care facilities  are
subject  to periodic pre  and postpayment reviews and  other audits by federal
and state authorities a review or  audit of claims against a facility  operator
could  result in recoupments denials or delays of payments in the future which
could have  a material  adverse effect  on the  operators ability  to meet  its
obligations  to us due  to the significant judgments  and estimates inherent in
payor settlement accounting no assurance can be given as to the adequacy of any
reserves maintained  by  our facility  operators  for potential  adjustments  to
reimbursements for payor settlements due to budgetary constraints governmental
payors  may  limit or  reduce  payments to  skilled  nursing and  specialty care
facilities as a result  of government reimbursement  programs being subject  to
such   budgetary  pressures  and  legislative  and  administrative  actions  an
operators ability to meet its obligations to us may be significantly impaired

     medicare reimbursement and skilled nursing facilities  for the year  ended
december  31 2003  approximately 28  of the  revenues at  our skilled nursing
facilities which comprised 37 of our revenues for the year ended december  31
2003  were from medicare reimbursement in an effort to reduce federal spending
on health care  the balanced  budget act  of 1997  bba contained  extensive
changes  to the medicare and medicaid  programs intended to reduce the projected
payments under these  programs the bba  fundamentally altered medicare  payment
methodologies for skilled nursing facilities by mandating the institution of the
skilled  nursing  facility  prospective  payment  system  this  system  differs
significantly from  the  prior  costbased  reimbursement  system  among  other
things  it sets  per diem  rates based on  1995 cost  reports as  adjusted by a
variety of factors  including but  not limited  to costs  associated with  44
resource  utilization group categories rugs the payments received under the
skilled nursing facility prospective payment system cover services for  medicare
patients  including all ancillary services  such as respiratory physical and
occupational therapy  and  certain  covered  medications  the  skilled  nursing
facility  prospective payment system caused  medicare per diem reimbursement for
skilled nursing  facility  services  to decrease  the  reductions  in  medicare
payments  resulted  in  immediate  financial  difficulties  for  skilled nursing
facilities and caused a number of operators to seek bankruptcy protection

     since the  bbas  passage  in  1997  the  federal  government  has  passed
legislation to lessen the negative financial impact from the prospective payment
system  for example under the balanced  budget refinement act of 1999 bbra
and the benefits improvement and patient  protection act of 2000 bipa  some
of  the  mandatory reductions  in medicare  payment  increases were  reversed or
delayed and skilled  nursing facilities received  temporary payment  increases
bbra included two key provisions i a 20 increase for 15 of the rugs and ii
a  4 acrosstheboard increase to  the federal per diem  rate the 20 increase
was implemented in april 2000 and will remain in effect until the implementation
of refinements  in  the  current  rug casemix  classification  system  the  4
increase  was implemented in april 2000 and  expired on september 30 2002 bipa
also included two key provisions i a 1666 increase in the nursing component
of the federal per diem rate and ii a 67 increase in the 14 rug payments for
rehabilitation therapy services the 1666 increase was implemented in april of
2001 and expired on september  30 2002 the 67  increase is an adjustment  to
the  20  increase granted  in  bbra and  spreads  the funds  directed  at three
                                        9

of those 15  rugs to  an additional 11  rehabilitation rugs  this increase  was
implemented  in april 2001 and will remain in effect until the implementation of
refinements in the current rug casemix classification system the 4 and 1666
increases that expired on september  30 2002 decreased annual reimbursement  by
roughly  18 billion although  the centers for  medicare and medicaid services
cms  did  not  implement  rug  refinements  for  fiscal  year  2004  annual
reimbursement will be reduced by roughly 10 billion if the new casemix system
is  implemented  in the  future there  is  no assurance  that the  new casemix
classification will account for  this reduction so  that nursing facilities  are
not adversely affected

     skilled  nursing facilities  received a  26 inflation  basket increase in
medicare payments for federal fiscal year  2003 which resulted in roughly  400
million  in  additional  reimbursement  in addition  cms  did  not  refine the
existing rug classification  system for fiscal  year 2003 or  fiscal year  2004
resulting  in roughly 10 billion  of additional annual reimbursement remaining
in place for fiscal year 2004 congress approved a 30 market basket  increase
and  cms  approved a  326 increase  to  the medicare  market basket  update to
correct for historical errors  in the inflation formula  the result of the  two
separate  inflationary updates is  an addition of over  850 million to medicare
reimbursement in fiscal year 2004 the medicare prescription drug  improvement
and  modernization act of 2003 imposed a moratorium on the therapy caps for part
b outpatient rehabilitation services through december 31 2005 the therapy caps
were mandated by the bba  if ever imposed the  annual payment cap would  apply
twice  a 1590 cap  per patient applies  to occupational therapy  and a second
1590 cap applies to physical  and speech therapy combined patients  exceeding
the  cap would  need to  use private  funds to  pay for  the cost  of additional
therapy

     medicare reimbursement and specialty care  facilities  for the year  ended
december  31  2003 approximately  42 of  the revenues  at our  specialty care
facilities which comprised 6 of our  revenues for the year ended december  31
2003 were from medicare our specialty care facilities generally are reimbursed
by  medicare  under either  the  diagnosis related  groupoutpatient prospective
payment system  reimbursement  methodology for  regular  hospitals or  the  new
prospective  payment system  for inpatient rehabilitation  facilities our acute
care hospitals  provide  a  wide  range of  inpatient  and  outpatient  services
including  but not  limited to  surgery rehabilitation  therapy and clinical
laboratories our longterm acute care hospitals provide inpatient services  for
patients  with  complex medical  conditions  that require  more  intensive care
monitoring or  emergency support  than that  available in  most skilled  nursing
facilities  some  of our  other  specialty care  hospitals  provide specialized
inpatient and outpatient services for specific illnesses or diseases  including
among others orthopedic neurosurgical and behavioral care services

     with  respect to medicares  diagnosis related groupoutpatient prospective
payment system methodology  for regular hospitals  reimbursement for  inpatient
services  is on the  basis of a  fixed prospective rate  based on the principal
diagnosis of the  patient diagnoses are  grouped into more  than 500  diagnosis
related  groups  in some  cases a  hospital might  be able  to qualify  for an
outlier payment if the  hospitals charges exceed a  threshold cms has  revised
its outlier methodology in response to allegations that some hospitals increased
their  outlier  reimbursement  by substantially  increasing  charges  under the
revisions outlier reimbursement for  all hospitals is  expected to decline  in
addition  the government is evaluating the past practices of hospitals relating
to outlier payments if  any of the operators  of our specialty care  facilities
were  found to  have substantially increased  charges in an  attempt to increase
outlier payments there is a risk that such operators could be investigated  and
required  to  refund  a  portion  of  outlier  payments  received  plus possible
penalties

     congress has limited  increases in diagnosis  related groups or  outpatient
prospective  payment  system  payments  these  limited  increases  may  not  be
sufficient to cover  specialty care  facilities increasing  costs of  providing
care  failure to increase reimbursement to cover increased costs or reductions
or freezes in payment  rates will have  an adverse impact  on operators of  our
specialty care facilities

     the  bba as amended by bbra and bipa also authorized the development of a
prospective payment system  for inpatient  rehabilitation facilities  including
freestanding  rehabilitation hospitals  and rehabilitation  units of  acute care
hospitals the  inpatient  rehabilitation facility  prospective  payment  system
methodology replaces the reasonable costbased payment system

     under  the final regulations that  implemented the inpatient rehabilitation
facility prospective payment systems  rehabilitation hospitals are required  to
complete a patient assessment instrument upon admission and

     pursuant  to the bba as  amended by bbra and  bipa payments during fiscal
years 2001  and 2002  were budget  neutral with  payments for  fiscal year  2001
equaling  98  of  the amount  of  payments that  would  have been  paid  if the
inpatient rehabilitation  facility  prospective  payment  system  had  not  been
enacted  and 100 for fiscal year 2002  for cost reporting periods beginning on
or after  october 1  2002 payment  is  based solely  on the  adjusted  federal
prospective payment

     the  ability of our operators  to adjust to the  shift from reasonable cost
reimbursement to an inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system
will impact  the cash  flow of  these facilities  failure to  control costs  or
manage the care provided under the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective
payment  system would have an  adverse impact on our  operators ability to meet
their obligations to us

     medicaid reimbursement  medicaid is a major payor source for residents  in
our  skilled nursing and specialty care  facilities for the year ended december
31 2003 approximately 54  of the revenues of  our skilled nursing  facilities
and  38 of the revenues  of our specialty care  facilities were attributable to
medicaid payments the  federal government and  the states share  responsibility
for  financing medicaid the federal matching rate known as the federal medical
assistance percentage fmap  varies between 50  and 77 by  state based  on
relative  per capita  income medicaid is  typically the second  largest item in
state  budgets  after  elementary  and  secondary  education  on  average  the
congressional  budget office  reports that medicaid  longterm care expenditures
represent about  threeeighths  of  total medicaid  expenditures  however  the
percentage  of medicaid dollars used for longterm care varies dramatically from
state to state  due to different  ratios of elderly  population and  eligibility
requirements  states  have a  wide range  of  discretion to  determine specific
reimbursement methodologies  currently  some  state medicaid  programs  use  a
costbased  reimbursement system in which the  rate that a facility receives may
be based  on the  costs  it historically  incurred  in providing  patient  care
reasonable  costs typically  include allowances  for administrative  and general
costs and costs of property and equipment eg depreciation and fair  rental
many  medicaid programs compute a per diem rate of reimbursement that is applied
prospectively certain states provide for efficiency incentives subject to cost
ceilings many of these programs  are subject to retrospective adjustment  under
which  a  facility operator  might be  required to  refund payments  that exceed
incurred costs

     in most states  medicaid does not  fully reimburse the  cost of  providing
skilled  nursing  services the  shortfall  is due  in  part to  the  bba which
repealed the  boren  amendment the  boren  amendment required  states  to  fund
medicaid  expenditures in an amount that  was sufficient to cover the reasonable
costs of an efficient provider consequently medicaid funding is vulnerable  to
state  balanced budget requirements due to  declining tax revenues some states
are attempting to slow the rate  of growth in medicaid expenditures by  freezing
rates  or  restricting  eligibility and  benefits  states will  benefit  from a
temporary increase in the fmap from july 1 2003 through september 30 2004 the
jobs and growth  tax relief reconciliation  act of 2003  included a 10  billion

     the  reimbursement methodologies applied to health care facilities continue
to evolve  federal  and state  authorities  have  considered and  may  seek  to
implement new or modified reimbursement methodologies that may negatively impact
health  care facility operations the impact of any such change if implemented
may result in  a material adverse  effect on our  skilled nursing and  specialty
care facility operations no assurance can be given that current revenue sources
or  levels  will be  maintained  accordingly there  can  be no  assurance that
payments under a government reimbursement program are currently or will in  the
future  be  sufficient  to fully  reimburse  the facility  operators  for their
operating and capital  expenses as  a result  the operators  ability to  meet
their obligations to us could be adversely impacted

  other related laws

     skilled   nursing  and  specialty  care  facilities  and  assisted  living
facilities that receive  medicaid payments  are subject to  federal state  and
local  laws and  regulations including  those laws  and regulations prohibiting
fraud  and  abuse  which  govern  the  operations  and  financial  and   other
arrangements that may be entered into by health care providers certain of these
laws  prohibit  direct or  indirect  payments of  any  kind for  the  purpose of
inducing or  encouraging  the  referral  of patients  for  medical  products  or
services  reimbursable by governmental programs other laws require providers to
furnish only medically necessary services and submit to the government valid and
accurate statements  for each  service still  other laws  require providers  to
comply  with a variety of safety health  and other requirements relating to the
condition of the licensed facility and  the quality of care provided  sanctions
for violation of these laws and regulations may include but are not limited to
criminal  andor civil penalties and fines and a loss of licensure and immediate
termination of  governmental payments  in certain  circumstances violation  of
these  rules such  as those prohibiting  abusive and  fraudulent behavior with
respect to one  facility may subject  other facilities under  common control  or
ownership  to sanctions  including disqualification  from participation  in the
medicare and  medicaid programs  in  the ordinary  course  of its  business  a
facility operator is regularly subjected to inquiries investigations and audits
by federal and state agencies that oversee these laws and regulations

     each  skilled nursing and specialty care  facility and any assisted living
facility  that  receives   medicaid  payments   is  subject   to  the   federal
antikickback   statute  which   generally  prohibits   persons  from  offering
providing soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce either the referral of
an individual or the furnishing of a  good or service for which payment may  be
made  under a  federal health  care program  such as  the medicare  and medicaid
programs skilled nursing and specialty care facilities are also subject to  the
federal  ethics in  patient referral  act of 1989  commonly referred  to as the
stark law  the  stark law  generally  prohibits  the submission  of  claims  to
medicare  for payment if the claim results from a physician referral for certain
designated services  and the  physician has  a financial  relationship with  the
health  service provider that does not qualify under one of the exceptions for a
financial relationship under  the stark law  similar prohibitions on  physician
selfreferrals  and  submission  of  claims apply  to  state  medicaid programs
further skilled  nursing and  specialty care  facilities and  assisted  living
facilities  that receive medicaid payments are subject to substantial financial
penalties under the civil monetary penalties  act and the false claims act  and
in  particular actions under the false claims acts whistleblower provisions
private enforcement of  health care  fraud has increased  due in  large part  to
amendments  to the false claims act that encourage private individuals to sue on
behalf of  the government  these whistleblower  suits by  private  individuals
known  as qui tam actions may be  filed by almost anyone including present and
former patients and nurses and other employees prosecutions investigations  or
qui  tam actions could have  a material adverse effect  on a facility operators
liquidity financial condition and results  of operations which could  adversely
affect  the ability  of the  operator to  meet its  obligations to  us finally
various state false claim and antikickback laws also may apply to each facility
operator violation of  any of  the foregoing  statutes can  result in  criminal
andor  civil penalties that could have a material adverse effect on the ability
of an operator to meet its obligations to us

     the health  insurance portability  and accountability  act of  1996  which
became effective january 1 1997 greatly expanded the definition of health care
fraud  and related  offenses and broadened  its scope to  include private health
care plans in addition to government  payors it also greatly increased  funding
for the department of justice federal bureau of investigation and the office of
the  inspector general of the department of  health and human services to audit
investigate and prosecute suspected health care fraud

                                        12

additionally the administrative simplification  provisions of this law  provide
for  communication of health information through standard electronic transaction
formats and for  the privacy  and security of  health information  in order  to
comply  with  the regulations  health care  providers must  undergo significant
operational  and  technical  changes  and  these  modifications  may  represent
significant  costs for our health care providers these additional costs may in
turn adversely affect the ability of our operators to meet their obligations to
us

     finally government investigation and enforcement  of health care laws  has
increased  dramatically over the past several years and is expected to continue
some of these enforcement actions represent novel legal theories and  expansions
in  the application of false claims laws  for example there have been a number
of complaints filed and settlements entered into by the united states  attorneys
office in the eastern district of pennsylvania alleging that the failure to meet
certain  conditions of  participation renders claims  for the care  false on the
theory that inadequate care was provided the costs for an operator of a  health
care  facility associated with  both defending such  enforcement actions and the
undertakings in  settlement  agreements can  be  substantial and  could  have  a
material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its obligations to
us

your own  tax  advisor regarding  the  particular us  federal  state  local
foreign and other tax consequences of acquiring owning and selling our stock

  general

     we  elected  to  be taxed  as  a  real estate  investment  trust  or reit
commencing with our first taxable year we intend to continue to operate in such
a manner as to qualify as a reit but there is no guaranty that we will  qualify
or  remain qualified as a reit  for subsequent years qualification and taxation
as a reit  depends upon our  ability to  meet a variety  of qualification  tests
imposed   under  federal  income  tax  law   with  respect  to  income  assets
distribution level and diversity  of share ownership  and discussed below  under
  qualification as a reit there can  be no assurance however that we will
be owned or  organized in a  manner so as  to qualify or  remain qualified as  a
reit

     in  any year  in which we  qualify as  a reit in  general we  will not be
subject to federal  income tax on  that portion  of our reit  taxable income  or
capital gain that is distributed to stockholders we may however be subject to
tax  at  normal corporate  rates upon  any  taxable income  or capital  gain not
distributed if we  elect to  retain and  pay income  tax on  our net  longterm
capital  gain stockholders are required to include their proportionate share of
our undistributed longterm  capital gain  in income  but they  will receive  a
refundable credit for their share of any taxes paid by us on such gain

                                        13
page

     despite  the reit election we may be  subject to federal income and excise
tax as follows

      to the extent that we  do not distribute all of  our net capital gain  or
       distribute  at  least  90 but  less  than  100 of  our  reit taxable
       income as adjusted  we will  be subject  to tax  on the  undistributed
       amount at regular corporate tax rates

      we  may be subject to  the alternative minimum tax  on certain items of
       tax preference to the extent that tax exceeds our regular tax

      if we have net income from the sale or other disposition of  foreclosure
       property  that is held  primarily for sale to  customers in the ordinary
       course of  business  or  other  nonqualifying  income  from  foreclosure
       property we will be subject to tax at the highest corporate rate on such
       income

      any net income from prohibited transactions which are in general sales
       or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in
       the  ordinary course of business  other than dispositions of foreclosure
       property and dispositions of property  due to an involuntary  conversion
       will be subject to a 100 tax

      if  we  fail to  satisfy either  the 75  or 95  gross income  tests as
       discussed below but  nonetheless maintain our  qualification as a  reit
       because  certain other requirements are met we will be subject to a 100
       tax on  an amount  equal to  1  the gross  income attributable  to  the
       greater of the amounts by which we failed the 75 or 95 test multiplied
       by 2 a fraction intended to reflect our profitability

      if  we fail to distribute during each year at least the sum of 1 85 of
       our reit ordinary income for such year 2 95 of our reit capital  gain
       net income for such year other than capital gain that we elect to retain
       and  pay tax on and 3  any undistributed taxable income from preceding
       periods we will  be subject to  a 4 excise  tax on the  excess of  such
       required distribution over amounts actually distributed and

      we  will also be subject to a tax of 100 on the amount of any rents from
       real property deductions  or excess interest  paid to us  by any of  our
       taxable reit subsidiaries that would be reduced through reapportionment
       under  certain federal  income tax  principles in  order to  more clearly
       reflect income of the taxable reit subsidiary see  qualification as a
       reit  investments in taxable reit subsidiaries

     if we acquire  any assets from  a corporation which  is or has  been a  c
corporation  in a carryover basis transaction  we could be liable for specified
liabilities that are inherited  from the c corporation  a c corporation  is
generally  defined as a corporation that is required to pay full corporate level
federal income  tax if  we recognize  gain on  the disposition  of such  assets
during  the  10year period  beginning on  the  date on  which such  assets were
acquired by us then to  the extent of such  assets builtin gain ie  the
excess  of the fair  market value of such  asset over the  adjusted tax basis in
such asset in each case determined as of the beginning of the 10year  period
we  will be subject  to tax on such  gain at the  highest regular corporate rate
applicable the  results  described  in  this  paragraph  with  respect  to  the
recognition  of builtin gain assume that the  builtin gain assets at the time
such builtin gain assets were subject  to a conversion transaction where a  c
corporation  elected  reit status  or a  reit  acquired such  assets from  a c
corporation were not treated as sold to an unrelated party and that no gain was
recognized

  qualification as a reit

     a reit is defined as a corporation trust or association

     1 which is managed by one or more trustees or directors

     2 the beneficial ownership of which  is evidenced by transferable  shares
         or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest

     3 which  would be taxable  as a domestic corporation  but for the federal
         income tax law relating to reits

                                        14
page

     4 which is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company

     5 the beneficial ownership  of which is  held by 100  or more persons  in
         each taxable year of the reit except for its first taxable year

     6 not  more than 50 in value of  the outstanding stock of which is owned
         during the last half of each taxable year excluding its first  taxable
         year  directly  or indirectly  by or  for  five or  fewer individuals
         which includes certain  entities the five  or fewer  requirement
         and

     7 which meets certain income and asset tests described below

     conditions  1 to  4 inclusive must  be met during  the entire taxable
year and condition 5 must be met during at least 335 days of a taxable year of
12 months or  during a  proportionate part  of a taxable  year of  less than  12
months  for purposes of conditions 5 and 6 pension funds and certain other
taxexempt entities  are treated  as individuals  subject to  a  lookthrough
exception in the case of condition 6

     based  on publicly available information we  believe we have satisfied the
share ownership  requirements set  forth  in 5  and  6 above  in  addition
article  vi  of  our  amended and  restated  bylaws  provides  for restrictions
regarding ownership and transfer of  shares these restrictions are intended  to
assist us in continuing to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in
5  and 6 above these restrictions however may not ensure that we will in
all cases be able to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in  5
and 6 above

     we  have complied with and will  continue to comply with regulatory rules
to send annual  letters to  certain of our  stockholders requesting  information
regarding  the  actual ownership  of our  stock if  despite sending  the annual
letters we do not know or after exercising reasonable diligence would not have
known whether we  failed to  meet the  five or  fewer requirement  we will  be
treated  as having met the five or fewer  requirement if we fail to comply with
these regulatory rules we will be subject to a monetary penalty if our failure
to comply was due to intentional disregard of the requirement the penalty would
be increased however if our failure to comply were due to reasonable cause and
not willful neglect no penalty would be imposed

     we may own  a number  of properties  through wholly  owned subsidiaries  a
corporation  will qualify as a qualified reit  subsidiary if 100 of its stock
is owned by a  reit and the  reit does not  elect to treat  the subsidiary as  a
taxable  reit subsidiary a qualified reit subsidiary will not be treated as a
separate  corporation  and  all  assets  liabilities  and  items  of   income
deductions  and  credits of  a qualified  reit subsidiary  will be  treated as
assets liabilities and items  as the case  may be of  the reit a  qualified
reit  subsidiary is not subject to federal income tax and our ownership of the
voting stock of a  qualified reit subsidiary will  not violate the  restrictions
against ownership of securities of any one issuer which constitute more than 10
of  the value or total voting power of such  issuer or more than 5 of the value
of our total assets as described below under  asset tests

     if we invest in a partnership a limited liability company or a trust taxed
as a  partnership or  as  a disregarded  entity  we will  be  deemed to  own  a
proportionate share of the partnerships limited liability companys or trusts
assets  likewise we will be  treated as receiving our  share of the income and
loss of  the partnership  limited liability  company or  trust and  the  gross
income will retain the same character in our hands as it has in the hands of the
partnership  limited  liability company  or  trust these  lookthrough rules
apply for purposes of the income tests and assets tests described below

     income tests   there are  two separate  percentage tests  relating to  our
sources of gross income that we must satisfy for each taxable year

      at  least 75  of our gross  income excluding gross  income from certain
       sales of property held primarily for sale must be directly or indirectly
       derived each taxable year from  rents from real property other  income
       from  investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property
       or certain income from qualified temporary investments and

                                        15
page

      at least 95  of our gross  income excluding gross  income from  certain
       sales of property held primarily for sale must be directly or indirectly
       derived  each taxable year from any of the sources qualifying for the 75
       test  and  from   dividends  including  dividends   from  taxable   reit
       subsidiaries  interest  gain from  the  sale or  disposition  of stock
       securities and payments to us under an interest rate swap cap agreement
       option futures contract forward rate agreement or any similar financial
       instrument entered into  by us to  hedge indebtedness incurred  or to  be
       incurred

     rents  received  by  us will  qualify  as  rents from  real  property for
purposes of  satisfying  the gross  income  tests for  a  reit only  if  several
conditions are met

      the amount of rent must not be based in whole or in part on the income or
       profits  of any  person although  rents generally  will not  be excluded
       merely because they  are based on  a fixed percentage  or percentages  of
       receipts or sales

      rents received from a tenant will not qualify as rents from real property
       if  the reit or  an owner of 10  or more of the  reit also directly or
       constructively owns 10 or more of such tenant unless the tenant is  our
       taxable  reit  subsidiary and  certain  other requirements  are  met with
       respect to the real property being rented

      if rent attributable  to personal  property leased in  connection with  a
       lease  of real property  is greater than  15 of the  total rent received
       under the lease then the portion  of rent attributable to such  personal
       property will not qualify as rents from real property and

      for  rents to qualify as rents from  real property we generally must not
       furnish or render services to tenants other than through a taxable  reit
       subsidiary  or an independent contractor from whom we derive no income
       except that  we  may  directly  provide services  that  are  usually  or
       customarily  rendered in  the geographic area  in which  the property is
       located in  connection with  the rental  of real  property for  occupancy
       only  or are not otherwise considered  rendered to the occupant for his
       convenience

     for taxable years beginning after august 5 1997 a reit has been permitted
to render a  de minimis amount  of impermissible services  to tenants and  still
treat amounts received with respect to that property as rent from real property
the  amount received  or accrued  by the  reit during  the taxable  year for the
impermissible services  with respect  to a  property may  not exceed  1 of  all
amounts  received  or  accrued  by  the reit  directly  or  indirectly  from the
property the amount received for any  service or management operation for  this
purpose  shall be deemed to be not less than 150 of the direct cost of the reit
in furnishing or rendering the service or providing the management or operation
furthermore impermissible services  may be  furnished to tenants  by a  taxable
reit  subsidiary subject  to certain  conditions and  we may  still treat rents
received with respect to the property as rent from real property

     the  term  interest  generally  does  not  include  any  amount  if   the
determination  of  such amount  depends in  whole or  in part  on the  income or
profits of any person  although an amount generally  will not be excluded  from
the  term interest solely  by reason of  being based on  a fixed percentage of
receipts or sales

     if we fail to satisfy one or both of the 75 or 95 gross income tests  for
any  taxable year we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for such year if we are
eligible for relief these relief provisions will be generally available if

      our failure to meet such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to
       willful neglect

      we attach a schedule of the sources of our income to our return and

      any incorrect  information on  the schedule  was not  due to  fraud  with
       intent to evade tax

     it is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be
entitled  to the benefit of these  relief provisions if these relief provisions
apply a  100 tax  is  imposed on  an  amount equal  to  a the  gross  income
attributable  to the  greater of the  amount by which  we failed the  75 or 95
test multiplied by b a fraction intended to reflect our profitability

     asset tests  at  the close of  each quarter of our  taxable year we  must
also  satisfy several  tests relating to  the nature and  diversification of our
assets determined in accordance  with generally accepted accounting  principles
at least 75 of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate
assets  cash cash items including receivables  arising in the ordinary course
of our operation  government securities and  qualified temporary  investments
although  the  remaining 25  of our  assets generally  may be  invested without
restriction we are prohibited from owning securities representing more than 10
of either the vote or  value of the outstanding  securities of any issuer  other
than a qualified reit subsidiary another reit or a taxable reit subsidiary the
10 vote and value test further no more than 20 of the total assets may be
represented  by securities of one or more  taxable reit subsidiaries and no more
than 5 of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities of any
nongovernmental issuer other than a qualified reit subsidiary another reit  or
a  taxable reit subsidiary each of the 10  vote and value test and the 20 and
5 asset tests must be  satisfied at the end of  any quarter there are  special
rules  which provide relief if the value  related tests are not satisfied due to
changes in the value of the assets of a reit

     investments in  taxable reit  subsidiaries   for taxable  years  beginning
after  december 31 2000  reits may own more  than 10 of  the voting power and
value of securities in taxable reit  subsidiaries we and any taxable  corporate
entity  in which we own  an interest are allowed to  jointly elect to treat such
entity as a taxable reit subsidiary

     several of our  subsidiaries have  elected to  be treated  as taxable  reit
subsidiaries  taxable  reit subsidiaries  are subject  to full  corporate level
federal taxation on their earnings but are permitted to engage in certain  types
of  activities which cannot be performed  directly by reits without jeopardizing
their reit status our  taxable reit subsidiaries will  attempt to minimize  the
amount  of such taxes  but there can be  no assurance whether  or the extent to
which measures taken  to minimize taxes  will be successful  to the extent  our
taxable reit subsidiaries are required to pay federal state or local taxes the
cash  available  for  distribution of  dividends  to  us from  our  taxable reit
subsidiaries will be reduced

     the amount of interest on relatedparty debt that a taxable reit subsidiary
may deduct is limited further a 100 tax applies to any interest payments by a
taxable reit subsidiary to its affiliated  reit to the extent the interest  rate
is not commercially reasonable a taxable reit subsidiary is permitted to deduct
interest payments to unrelated parties without any such restrictions

     the  internal revenue service  may reallocate costs between  a reit and its
taxable reit subsidiary where  there is a lack  of arms length dealing  between
the  parties  any  deductible  expenses  allocated  away  from  a  taxable reit
subsidiary would increase its tax liability further any amount by which a reit
understates its deductions and overstates  those of its taxable reit  subsidiary
will subject to certain exceptions be subject to a 100 tax

     additional  taxable reit subsidiary elections may be made in the future for
additional entities in which we own an interest

     annual distribution  requirements   in order  to avoid  being taxed  as  a
regular  corporation we are required to  make distributions other than capital
gain distributions to  our stockholders  which qualify for  the dividends  paid
deduction  in an amount at  least equal to a  the sum of i  90 of our reit
taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our
net capital  gain and  ii  90 of  the aftertax  net  income if  any  from
foreclosure  property minus b a portion  of certain items of noncash income
such distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate or  in
the  following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for
such year and if paid on or before the first regular distribution payment  after
such  declaration the amount  distributed must not  be preferential this means
that every stockholder of  the class of  stock to which  a distribution is  made
must  be treated the same as every other stockholder of that class and no class
of stock may be treated otherwise than in accordance with its dividend rights as
a class to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain  or
distribute  at least 90 but  less than 100 of  our reit taxable income as
adjusted we  will be  subject to  tax on  the undistributed  amount at  regular
corporate tax rates finally as discussed above we may be subject to an excise
tax if we fail

                                        17
page

to  meet  certain  other distribution  requirements  we intend  to  make timely
distributions sufficient to satisfy these annual distribution requirements

     it is possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash  or
other  liquid assets to meet the  90 distribution requirement or to distribute
such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation due
to among other things a timing differences between i the actual receipt of
income and actual payment of deductible expenses and ii the inclusion of  such
income  and deduction of such expenses in arriving at our taxable income or b
the payment of severance benefits that may not be deductible to us in the event
that such timing  differences occur  we may find  it necessary  to arrange  for
borrowings or if possible pay dividends in the form of taxable stock dividends
in order to meet the distribution requirement

     under certain circumstances in the event of a deficiency determined by the
internal  revenue service we may be able to rectify a resulting failure to meet
the distribution  requirement for  a year  by paying  deficiency dividends  to
stockholders  in  a later  year  which may  be  included in  our  deduction for
distributions paid for the  earlier year thus  we may be  able to avoid  being
taxed  on amounts distributed  as deficiency distributions  however we will be
required to pay applicable penalties and  interest based upon the amount of  any
deduction taken for deficiency distributions

  failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust

     if  we fail to qualify for taxation as  a reit in any taxable year we will
be subject to federal income  tax including any applicable alternative  minimum
tax  on  our  taxable  income  at  regular  corporate  rates  distributions to
stockholders in any  year in  which we fail  to qualify  as a reit  will not  be
deductible  nor will  any particular amount  of distributions be  required to be
made in any year all distributions to stockholders will be taxable as  ordinary
income  to the extent of current  and accumulated earnings and profits allocable
to such distributions and subject to certain limitations will be eligible  for
the  dividends received deduction for corporate stockholders unless entitled to
relief under specific statutory  provisions we also  will be disqualified  from
taxation  as a reit for  the four taxable years  following the year during which
qualification was lost it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances
we would be entitled to such statutory  relief failure to qualify for even  one
year  could result in our need to incur indebtedness or liquidate investments in

     treatment of taxable us stockholders   the following summary applies  to
you  only if you are a us stockholder a us stockholder is a stockholder
of shares of stock who for united states federal income tax purposes is

      a citizen or resident of the united states

      a corporation partnership  or other  entity created or  organized in  or
       under  the laws of  the united states or  of any state  thereof or in the
       district of  columbia unless  in the  case of  a partnership  treasury
       regulations provide otherwise

      an  estate the income of which is subject to united states federal income
       taxation regardless of its source or

      a trust whose administration is subject  to the primary supervision of  a
       united  states court and which has one  or more united states persons who
       have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust

     so long as we qualify  for taxation as a  reit distributions on shares  of
our  stock made out of the current or accumulated earnings and profits allocable
thereto and not  designated as capital  gain dividends will  be includable  as
ordinary  income for  federal income tax  purposes none  of these distributions
will be  eligible  for  the  dividends received  deduction  for  us  corporate
stockholders  distributions that are designated  as capital gain dividends will
be taxed as longterm capital gains to the extent they do not exceed our actual
net capital

                                        18

gain for the taxable year without regard to the period for which you held  our
stock however if you are a corporation you may be required to treat a portion
of some capital gain dividends as ordinary income

     if we elect to retain and pay income tax on any net longterm capital gain
you would include in income as longterm capital gain your proportionate share
of  such net  longterm capital  gain you would  also receive  a refundable tax
credit for your  proportionate share  of the  tax paid  by us  on such  retained
capital  gains and you would have an increase in the basis of your shares of our
stock in an amount equal to your includable capital gains less your share of the
tax deemed paid

     you may  not include  in your  federal income  tax return  any of  our  net
operating  losses or capital  losses federal income tax  rules may also require
that certain minimum tax adjustments and  preferences be apportioned to you  in
addition  any distribution declared  by us in october  november or december of
any year on a specified date in any such month shall be treated as both paid  by
us  and  received  by  you  on  december 31  of  such  year  provided  that the
distribution is actually paid by  us no later than  january 31 of the  following
year

     we  will be treated as having sufficient earnings and profits to treat as a
dividend any distribution up to the  amount required to be distributed in  order
to  avoid  imposition of  the 4  excise  tax discussed  under   general and
 qualification as  a reit   annual distribution requirements  above as  a
result  you may be required to treat as taxable dividends certain distributions
that would  otherwise result  in a  taxfree return  of capital  moreover  any
deficiency  dividend will be treated as a  dividend an ordinary dividend or a
capital gain  dividend as  the case  may be  regardless of  our earnings  and
profits  any other distributions  in excess of  current or accumulated earnings
and profits will not be taxable to  you to the extent such distributions do  not
exceed  the adjusted tax basis of your shares of our stock you will be required
to reduce the  tax basis  of your  shares of  our stock  by the  amount of  such
distributions  until  such basis  has  been reduced  to  zero after  which such
distributions will be taxable as  capital gain if the  shares of our stock  are
held  as a capital asset the tax basis  as so reduced will be used in computing
the capital gain or loss if any realized upon sale of the shares of our stock
any loss upon a sale or exchange of shares of our stock which were held for  six
months  or  less  after  application  of  certain  holding  period  rules will
generally be treated as  a longterm capital loss  to the extent you  previously
received capital gain distributions with respect to such shares of our stock

     upon  the sale or exchange of  any shares of our stock  to or with a person
other than us or a sale or exchange of all shares of our stock whether actually
or constructively owned with us you  will generally recognize capital gain  or
loss  equal  to the  difference  between the  amount  realized on  such  sale or
exchange and your adjusted tax basis in such shares of our stock such gain will
be capital gain if you held such shares of our stock as a capital asset

     gain from the sale or exchange of our shares held for more than one year is
taxed at a maximum longterm capital gain rate which is currently 15 pursuant
to internal revenue service  guidance we may classify  portions of our  capital
gain dividends as gains eligible for the longterm capital gains rate or as gain
taxable to individual stockholders at a maximum rate of 25

     treatment  of taxexempt us stockholders  taxexempt entities including
qualified employee pension and profit  sharing trusts and individual  retirement
accounts  exempt  organizations generally  are  exempt from  federal income
taxation however  they are  subject to  taxation on  their unrelated  business
taxable  income ubti  the internal revenue  service has  issued a published
revenue ruling that  dividend distributions from  a reit to  an exempt  employee
pension  trust do not constitute ubti provided  that the shares of the reit are
not otherwise used  in an  unrelated trade or  business of  the exempt  employee
pension  trust  based  on this  ruling  amounts  distributed by  us  to exempt
organizations generally  should  not  constitute ubti  however  if  an  exempt
organization  finances its acquisition of  the shares of our  stock with debt a
portion of  its  income from  us  will constitute  ubti  pursuant to  the  debt
financed  property  rules likewise  a  portion of  its  income from  us would
constitute ubti  if  we held  a  residual interest  in  a real  estate  mortgage
investment conduit

     in  addition in certain circumstances a pension trust that owns more than
10 of our stock  is required to  treat a percentage of  our dividends as  ubti
this   rule  applies  to  a   pension  trust  holding  more   than  10  of  our

                                        19
page

stock only if i the percentage of our income that is ubti determined as if we
were a pension trust is at least 5 ii we qualify as a reit by reason of the
modification of the five or fewer  requirement that allows beneficiaries of  the
pension  trust to be treated as holding  shares in proportion to their actuarial
interests in the pension trust and iii either a one pension trust owns more
than 25 of the value of our stock or b a group of pension trusts individually
holding more than 10 of the value  of our stock collectively own more than  50
of the value of our stock

     backup withholding and information reporting  under certain circumstances
you  may be subject to  backup withholding at applicable  rates on payments made
with respect to or cash proceeds of a sale or exchange of shares of our stock
backup withholding will apply only if you

      fail to  furnish  the person  required  to withhold  with  your  taxpayer
       identification number tin

      furnish an incorrect tin

      are  notified by  the internal  revenue service  that you  have failed to
       properly report payments of interest and dividends or

      under certain circumstances fail to  certify under penalty or  perjury
       that  you have furnished a correct tin  and have not been notified by the
       internal revenue service that you  are subject to backup withholding  for
       failure to report interest and dividend payments

     backup  withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain
exempt recipients such as corporations and taxexempt organizations you should
consult with a  tax advisor  regarding qualification for  exemption from  backup
withholding  and the procedure for obtaining such exemption backup withholding
is not an  additional tax  rather the amount  of any  backup withholding  with
respect  to payment to  a stockholder will  be allowed as  a credit against such
stockholders united states federal  income tax liability  and may entitle  such
stockholder  to a refund provided that  the required information is provided to
the internal revenue service in addition withholding a portion of capital gain
distributions made to stockholders may be required for stockholders who fail  to
certify their nonforeign status

     taxation  of foreign  stockholders  the  following summary  applies to you
only if you are a foreign person  the federal taxation of foreign persons is  a
highly complex matter that may be affected by many considerations

     distributions  to you of cash generated  by our real estate operations but
not by the sale or exchange of our capital assets generally will be subject  to
us  withholding tax at a rate of  30 unless an applicable tax treaty reduces
that tax and you file with us the required form evidencing such lower rate

     in general you will be  subject to united states  federal income tax on  a
graduated  rate basis rather than withholding with respect to your investment in
our stock if such investment is  effectively connected with your conduct of  a
trade  or business  in the united  states a corporate  foreign stockholder that
receives income that is or is  treated as effectively connected with a  united
states trade or business may also be subject to the branch profits tax which is
payable in addition to regular united states corporate income tax the following
discussion  will apply to foreign stockholders whose  investment in us is not so
effectively connected  we  expect to  withhold  united states  income  tax  as
described below on the gross amount of any distributions paid to you unless i
you  file an  internal revenue  service form  w8eci with  us claiming  that the
distribution is effectively connected or ii certain other exceptions apply

     distributions by us that are attributable to gain from the sale or exchange
of a united states real property interest will be taxed to you under the foreign
investment in real property tax act of 1980 firpta as if such  distributions
were  gains  effectively connected  with a  united  states trade  or business
accordingly you will be taxed at the normal capital gain rates applicable to  a
us  stockholder on such amounts subject to any applicable alternative minimum
tax and  a special  alternative minimum  tax in  the case  of nonresident  alien
individuals  distributions subject  to firpta may  also be subject  to a branch
profits tax in the hands of a corporate foreign stockholder that is not entitled
to treaty exemption

                                        20

     we will be required to withhold  from distributions subject to firpta  and
remit to the internal revenue service 35 of designated capital gain dividends
or  if greater 35 of the amount of any distributions that could be designated
as capital gain dividends in addition  if we designate prior distributions  as
capital gain dividends subsequent distributions up to the amount of such prior
distributions  not withheld against  will be treated  as capital gain dividends
for purposes of withholding

     unless our  shares  constitute a  united  states real  property  interest
within  the meaning of firpta or are  effectively connected with a us trade or
business a sale of such shares by  you generally will not be subject to  united
states  taxation our shares  will not constitute a  united states real property
interest if we qualify as a domestically controlled reit we do and expect to
continue  to  qualify  as  a  domestically  controlled  reit  a   domestically
controlled  reit is  a reit  in which  at all  times during  a specified testing
period less than 50 in  value of its shares is  held directly or indirectly  by
foreign  stockholders however if you are a nonresident alien individual who is
present in the united states  for 183 days or more  during the taxable year  and
certain other conditions apply you will be subject to a 30 tax on such capital
gains  in any event  a purchaser of our  shares from you  will not be required
under firpta  to withhold  on the  purchase price  if the  purchased shares  are
regularly  traded  on  an  established  securities  market  or  if  we  are  a
domestically controlled  reit otherwise  under firpta  the purchaser  may  be
required  to withhold  10 of the  purchase price  and remit such  amount to the
internal revenue service

     backup withholding tax and information  reporting will generally not  apply
to  distributions paid to you outside the  united states that are treated as i
dividends to which the 30 or lower treaty rate withholding tax discussed  above
applies  ii capital gains  dividends or iii  distributions attributable to
gain from the sale or exchange by us of us real property interests payment of
the proceeds of a sale  of stock within the  united states or conducted  through
certain  us  related  financial  intermediaries  is  subject  to  both  backup
withholding and  information reporting  unless  the beneficial  owner  certifies
under  penalties of perjury that he  or she is not a  us person and the payor
does not have actual knowledge  that the beneficial owner  is a us person  or
the  stockholder otherwise established an exemption  you may obtain a refund of
any  amounts  withheld  under  the  backup  withholding  rules  by  filing   the
appropriate claim for refund with the internal revenue service

  potential legislation or other actions affecting tax consequences

     current  and  prospective stockholders  should  recognize that  the present
federal income  tax  treatment  of  an  investment in  us  may  be  modified  by
legislative  judicial or  administrative action at  any time and  that any such
action may affect investments and commitments previously made the rules dealing
with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved  in
the  legislative process  and by the  internal revenue service  and the treasury
department resulting in revisions of regulations and revised interpretations of
established concepts as well as statutory changes revisions in federal tax laws
and interpretations of these laws could adversely affect the tax consequences of
an investment in us current and prospective investors should also consult their
own tax advisors regarding the effect of state local and foreign tax laws on an
investment in us

arrangements  internally  generated cash  and the  proceeds derived  from asset
sales permanent financing  for future investments  which replaces funds  drawn

     we  generated increased  rental income  as a  result of  the acquisition of
properties for which we receive rent  this was partially offset by a  reduction
in  interest income  due to  lower average  yields on  our loans  receivable and
nonrecognition of interest  income related  to our mortgage  loan with  doctors
community  health care corporation transaction  fees and other income increased
primarily as a result of  the gain from the sale  of our investment in  atlantic

     the  increase in interest  expense from 2002  to 2003 was  primarily due to
higher average borrowings during  the year this was  partially offset by  lower
average  interest rates  and an increase  in the amount  of capitalized interest
offsetting interest expense

     we capitalize certain interest costs associated with funds used to  finance
the  construction of properties owned directly  by us the amount capitalized is
based upon the balance outstanding during the construction period using the rate
of interest that  approximates our cost  of financing our  interest expense  is
reduced  by  the amount  capitalized capitalized  interest  for the  year ended
december 31 2003 totaled  1535000 as compared with  170000 for the  same
period in 2002

     the   provision  for  depreciation  increased  primarily  as  a  result  of
additional investments in properties owned directly by us

     general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues  including
revenues  from discontinued  operations for the  year ended  december 31 2003
were 539 as compared with 583 for the same period in 2002

     the  increase  in  loan  expense  was  primarily  due  to  the   additional
amortization  of costs related  to the unsecured lines  of credit amendments and
costs related  to obtaining  consents to  modify the  covenant packages  of  our
senior unsecured notes

     during  the  year  ended december  31  2003  it was  determined  that the
projected undiscounted cash flows from a property did not exceed its related net
book value and  an impairment charge  of 2792000 was  recorded to reduce  the
property  to its estimated fair market value the estimated fair market value of
the property was determined by an  independent appraisal during the year  ended
december  31 2002 it was determined that the projected undiscounted cash flows
from three  properties  did  not  exceed  their  related  net  book  values  and
impairment charges of 2298000 were recorded to reduce the properties to their
estimated fair market values the estimated fair market values of the properties
were  determined by offers to purchase  received from third parties or estimated
net sales proceeds

     in april 2002 we purchased 35000000 of our outstanding senior unsecured
notes that were due in 2003 and recorded a charge of 403000 in connection with
this early extinguishment

     due to increased collectibility  concerns related to  portions of our  loan
portfolio  we  increased our  allowance for  losses on  loans receivable  by an
additional 1870000 for the year ended december 31 2003

     during the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 we sold properties  with
carrying  values of 61316000 and 53311000  for net gains of 4139000 and
net losses of 1032000 respectively in august 2001 the financial accounting
standards board  issued statement  no  144 accounting  for the  impairment  or
disposal  of longlived  assets which is  effective for  fiscal years beginning
after december 15 2001 we adopted  the standard effective january 1 2002  in
accordance  with statement no 144 we have reclassified the income and expenses
attributable  to  the  properties  sold   subsequent  to  january  1  2002   to
discontinued operations these properties generated 2858000 and 5318000 of
income after deducting depreciation and interest expense from rental revenue for
the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively

     the  decrease in preferred  dividends is primarily due  to the reduction in
average outstanding preferred shares during  the year ended december 31  2003
the  holder of  our series  c cumulative  convertible preferred  stock converted
2100000 shares  into  2049000 shares  of  common stock  leaving  no  shares
outstanding at december 31 2003 as compared to 2100000 at december 31 2002

     in  september 2003  we issued 1060000  shares of 6  series e cumulative
convertible and  redeemable  preferred  stock during  the  three  months  ended
december  31 2003 certain  holders of our series  e cumulative convertible and
redeemable preferred  stock  converted 229600  shares  into 175700  shares  of
common stock leaving 830400 outstanding at december 31 2003

     in  july 2003 we  closed a public  offering of 4000000  shares of 7875
series d cumulative redeemable preferred stock  a portion of the proceeds  from
this  offering were used to  redeem all 3000000 shares  of our 8875 series b
cumulative redeemable preferred stock on july 15 2003 in accordance with  eitf
topic  d42 the costs  to issue these  securities were recorded  as a noncash
nonrecurring charge of  2790000 or 006  per diluted share  in the  third
quarter of 2003 to reduce net income available to common stockholders

     as a result of the various factors mentioned above net income available to
common  stockholders was  70732000 or 160  per diluted share  for 2003 as

     we  generated increased  rental income  as a  result of  the acquisition of
properties for which we receive rent  this was partially offset by a  reduction
in  interest income due to the repayment of mortgage loans transaction fees and
other income decreased primarily as a  result of the completion of  construction
projects

     during  2001  we  received  payoffs  on  mortgages  that  had  significant
prepayment fee requirements generating 990000  in that year during 2002  we
did not receive any prepayment fees with respect to mortgage loan payoffs

     expenses were comprised of the following dollars in thousands

     the  increase in interest  expense from 2001  to 2002 was  primarily due to
higher average  borrowings during  the year  and a  reduction in  the amount  of
capitalized interest offsetting interest expense

     we  capitalize certain interest costs associated with funds used to finance
the construction of properties owned directly  by us the amount capitalized  is
based upon the balance outstanding during the construction period using the rate
of  interest that  approximates our cost  of financing our  interest expense is
reduced by  the amount  capitalized  capitalized interest  for the  year  ended
december  31 2002  totaled 170000  as compared  with 841000  for the same
period in 2001

     the  provision  for  depreciation  increased  primarily  as  a  result   of
additional investments in properties owned directly by us

     general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues including
revenues from discontinued  operations for  the year ended  december 31  2002
were 583 as compared with 603 for the same period in 2001

     the   increase  in  loan  expense  was  primarily  due  to  the  additional
amortization of costs related  to the unsecured line  of credit renewal and  the
senior unsecured notes issued in 2001 and 2002

     during  the  year  ended december  31  2002  it was  determined  that the
projected undiscounted cash  flows from  three properties did  not exceed  their
related   net   book  values   and   impairment  charges   of   2298000  were

                                        35

recorded to reduce  the properties to  their estimated fair  market values  the
estimated  fair market  values of  the properties  were determined  by offers to
purchase received from third parties or estimated net sales proceeds

     in april 2002 we purchased 35000000 of our outstanding senior unsecured
notes that were due in 2003 and recorded a charge of 403000 in connection with
this early extinguishment  in september  2001 we purchased  7750000 of  our
outstanding  unsecured senior notes that were due  in 2002 and recorded a charge
of 213000 in connection with this early extinguishment

     other items were comprised of the following dollars in thousands

     during the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 we sold properties  with
carrying  values of 53311000 and 23829000 for net losses of 1032000 and
1250000 respectively  in august  2001 the  financial accounting  standards
board  issued statement  no 144 accounting  for the impairment  or disposal of
longlived assets which is effective for fiscal years beginning after  december
15  2001 we adopted the standard effective january 1 2002 in accordance with
statement no 144 we have reclassified the income and expenses attributable  to
the  properties sold subsequent  to january 1  2002 to discontinued operations
these properties generated 5318000 and  6019000 of income after  deducting
depreciation  and  interest  expense from  rental  revenue for  the  years ended
december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively

     the decrease in preferred  dividends is primarily due  to the reduction  in
average  outstanding preferred shares during the  year ended december 31 2002
the holder  of our  series c  cumulative convertible  preferred stock  converted
900000  shares into  878000 shares of  common stock  leaving 2100000 shares
outstanding at december 31 2002 as compared to 3000000 at december 31 2001

     as a result of the various factors mentioned above net income available to
common stockholders was  55191000 or 148  per diluted share  for 2002  as
compared with 47044000 or 152 per diluted share for 2001

critical accounting policies

     our  consolidated  financial  statements are  prepared  in  accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require  us
to  make estimates  and assumptions  see note  1 to  the consolidated financial
statements we  believe  that  of  our  significant  accounting  policies  the
following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and
estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements

  revenue recognition

     revenue  is recorded in accordance  with securities and exchange commission
staff accounting bulletin no 101  revenue recognition in financial  statements
sab  101 as amended sab 101 requires that revenue be recognized after four
basic criteria are met  these four criteria include  persuasive evidence of  an
arrangement  the  rendering  of  service  fixed  and  determinable  income and
reasonably  assured  collectibility  if   the  collectibility  of  revenue   is
determined  incorrectly the amount and timing  of our reported revenue could be
significantly affected interest income on  loans is recognized as earned  based
upon the principal amount outstanding subject to an evaluation of collectibility
risk  operating lease income  generally includes base  rent payments plus fixed
annual rent increases which  are recognized on a  straightline basis over  the
minimum lease period subject to an evaluation of collectibility risk this lease
income  is greater than the amount of cash received during the first half of the
lease term in  some instances  the leases  provide for  additional payment  of

                                        36
page

rent  if the gross  operating revenues from the  property exceed a predetermined
threshold revenues are not recognized until those thresholds have been met

  impairment of longlived assets

     the net book value of longlived assets is reviewed quarterly on a property
by property basis  to determine  if there  are indicators  of impairment  these
indicators  may include anticipated operating losses  at the property level the
tenants inability to  make rent  payments a decision  to dispose  of an  asset
before  the end of its estimated useful life  and changes in the market that may
permanently reduce the value of the property if indicators of impairment exist
then the undiscounted future cash flows from the most likely use of the property
are compared to the current net book  value if the undiscounted cash flows  are
less  than the  net book value  an impairment  loss would be  recognized to the
extent that  the net  book value  exceeds the  current fair  market value  this
analysis  requires  us to  determine if  indicators of  impairment exist  and to
estimate the most likely stream of cash flows to be generated from the  property
during  the period the  property is expected  to be held  if the projections or
assumptions change in  the future we  may be required  to record an  impairment
charge and reduce the net book value of the property owned

  allowance for loan losses

     the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate to
absorb  potential  losses  in our  loans  receivable the  determination  of the
allowance is based on a quarterly  evaluation of these loans including  general
economic conditions and estimated collectibility of loan payments and principal
we evaluate the collectibility of our loans receivable based on a combination of
factors  including  but not  limited to  delinquency status  historical loan
chargeoffs financial strength of the borrower and guarantors and value of  the
underlying property if such factors indicate that there is greater risk of loan
chargeoffs  additional allowances  or placement  on nonaccrual  status may be
required a loan is impaired when  based on current information and events  it
is  probable that  we will  be unable  to collect  all amounts  due as scheduled
according to the contractual  terms of the  original loan agreement  consistent
with  this  definition all  loans on  nonaccrual are  deemed impaired  to the
extent circumstances improve and  the risk of  collectibility is diminished  we
will return these loans to full accrual status

  depreciation and useful lives

     we  compute depreciation on  our properties using  the straightline method
based on  their estimated  useful lives  which range  from 15  to 40  years  for
buildings  and five to 15  years for improvements a  significant portion of the
acquisition  cost  of   each  property   is  allocated   to  building   usually
approximately  90 the allocation of the  acquisition cost to building and the
determination of  the  useful  life  of  a  property  are  based  on  appraisals
commissioned from independent real estate appraisal firms if we do not allocate
appropriately  to the building or if we  incorrectly estimate the useful life of
our properties the computation of  depreciation will not appropriately  reflect
the carrying values of the properties over future periods

impact of inflation

     during  the past three years inflation  has not significantly affected our
earnings because of the moderate inflation rate additionally our earnings  are
primarily  longterm investments with  fixed rates of  return these investments
are mainly financed  with a combination  of equity senior  unsecured notes  and
borrowings  under our lines of credit arrangements during inflationary periods
which generally are accompanied  by rising interest rates  our ability to  grow
may be adversely affected because the yield on new investments may increase at a
slower  rate  than new  borrowing costs  presuming  the current  inflation rate
remains moderate and longterm interest rates do not increase significantly  we
believe  that  inflation will  not impact  the availability  of equity  and debt
financing

forwardlooking statements and risk factors

     we  have made  and incorporated by  reference statements in  this form 10k
that constitute  forwardlooking statements  as that  term is  defined in  the
federal securities laws these forwardlooking statements concern

      the possible expansion of our portfolio

      the performance of our operators and properties

      our  ability  to  enter  into  agreements  with  new  viable  tenants for
       properties which we take back from financially troubled tenants if any

      our ability to make distributions

      our policies  and  plans  regarding  investments  financings  and  other
       matters

      our tax status as a real estate investment trust

      our ability to appropriately balance the use of debt and equity and

      our ability to access capital markets or other sources of funds

     when  we use words such as believe expect anticipate estimate or
similar expressions we are  making forwardlooking statements  forwardlooking
statements  are  not  guaranties of  future  performance and  involve  risks and
uncertainties our expected results may not  be achieved and actual results  may
differ  materially  from  our expectations  this  may  be a  result  of various
factors including but not limited to

      the status of the economy

      the status of capital markets including prevailing interest rates

      changes in financing terms and

      the risks described below

  risk factors related to our operators revenues and expenses

     our skilled nursing  and specialty  care facility  operators revenues  are
primarily  driven by occupancy medicare  and medicaid reimbursement and private
pay rates our assisted living facility operators revenues are primarily driven
by occupancy and private pay rates expenses for these three types of facilities
are primarily driven by  the costs of labor  food utilities taxes  insurance
and  rent or debt service revenues  from government reimbursement have and may
continue to come  under pressure  due to  reimbursement cuts  and state  budget
shortfalls  liability insurance and staffing costs continue to increase for our
operators to the extent  that any decrease in  revenues andor any increase  in
operating  expenses  result in  a facility  not generating  enough cash  to make
payments to us the  credit of our  operator and the  value of other  collateral
would have to be relied upon

  risk factors related to operator bankruptcies

     we  are exposed to the risk that our  operators may not be able to meet the
rent principal and interest or  other payments due us  which may result in  an
operator  bankruptcy or insolvency or that  an operator might become subject to
bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings for  other reasons although our  operating
lease  agreements provide  us the right  to evict an  operator demand immediate
payment of rent and exercise other  remedies and our mortgage loans provide  us
the  right to  terminate any funding  obligation demand  immediate repayment of
principal and unpaid interest  foreclose on the  collateral and exercise  other
remedies  the bankruptcy laws afford  certain rights to a  party that has filed
for bankruptcy or reorganization an operator in bankruptcy may be able to limit
or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent in the case of a lease or to receive
unpaid principal and interest in  the case of a  mortgage loan and to  exercise
other rights and remedies

                                        38

     the  receipt of liquidation proceeds or the replacement of an operator that
has defaulted on its lease or loan  could be delayed by the approval process  of
any federal state or local agency necessary for the transfer of the facility or
the replacement of the operator licensed to manage the facility in addition we
may  be  required  to  fund  certain  expenses  eg  real  estate  taxes  and
maintenance to preserve the value of a facility avoid the imposition of  liens
on  a  facility andor  to  transition a  facility to  a  new operator  in some
instances we have terminated our lease with an operator and relet the  facility
to  another operator in  some of those situations  we provided working capital
loans to  and  limited  indemnification  of  the  new  operator  if  we  cannot
transition  a leased facility to a new  operator we may take possession of that
facility which  may expose  us to  certain successor  liabilities should  such
events occur our revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely affected

     on  november 20 2002  doctors community health  care corporation and five
subsidiaries doctors  filed  for chapter  11  bankruptcy protection  in  the
united states bankruptcy court for the district of columbia doctors stated that
its  bankruptcy filing was  due to the bankruptcy  of national century financial
enterprises and  affiliates which  halted payments  to health  care  providers
including doctors we have provided mortgage financing to doctors in the form of
a loan secured by the pacifica hospital of the valley in sun valley ca and the
other  assets  of the  pacifica of  the  valley corporation  one of  the debtor
subsidiaries the outstanding  principal balance of  the loan was  approximately
18797000  on  december  31  2003 pursuant  to  procedures  approved  by the
bankruptcy court the assets of doctors were  the subject of an auction held  on
december  10 through december 16  2003 at the conclusion  of that auction the
debtors independent director  declared certain members  of doctors  management
the  winning bidder their bid contemplates  a reorganization of doctors and its
subsidiaries with  new  equity and  debt  capitalization the  results  of  this
auction  are subject to bankruptcy court approval which the debtors have stated
they intend to  seek in connection  with a  hearing on the  confirmation of  the
debtors  proposed plan of reorganization doctors anticipates that this hearing
should occur in march or  april 2004 doctors did  not make an interest  payment
for  the  twelve months  ended  december 31  2003  we will  not  recognize any
interest on the loan until payment is received

     alterra healthcare corporation alterra filed for chapter 11  bankruptcy
protection  on january 23  2003 in the  united states bankruptcy  court for the
district of delaware we have a master lease with alterra for 45 assisted living
facilities with a depreciated book value of 103293000 at december 31 2003 a
joint venture between fortress investment group llc and emeritus corporation was

connection with confirmation of alterras plan our master lease was assumed and
the  acquisition of alterra by the fortressemeritus joint venture was approved
this transaction  has  closed  alterra  remained  current  on  rental  payments
throughout the bankruptcy process

  risk factors related to government regulations

     our  operators  businesses are  affected  by government  reimbursement and
private payor rates to  the extent that any  skilled nursing or specialty  care
facility  receives  a  significant  portion of  its  revenues  from governmental
payors primarily  medicare  and  medicaid  such revenues  may  be  subject  to
statutory  and  regulatory changes  retroactive  rate adjustments  recovery of
program   overpayments    or    setoffs   administrative    rulings    policy
interpretations  payment or  other delays by  fiscal intermediaries government
funding restrictions at a program level or with respect to specific facilities
and  interruption  or  delays  in  payments  due  to  any  ongoing  governmental
investigations and audits at such facility in recent years governmental payors
have  frozen  or reduced  payments  to health  care  providers due  to budgetary
pressures this trend in health care reimbursement will likely continue to be of
paramount importance  to  federal and  state  authorities we  cannot  make  any
assessment  as to the  ultimate timing or effect  any future legislative reforms
may have  on  the financial  condition  of  the skilled  nursing  industry  the
specialty  care industry or on the health care industry in general there can be
no assurance that adequate  reimbursement levels will  continue to be  available
for  services provided by  any facility operator  whether the facility receives
reimbursement from medicare medicaid or  private payors significant limits  on
the  scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have
a material adverse effect  on an operators  liquidity financial condition  and
results of

                                        39
page

operations  which could adversely affect the ability of an operator to meet its
obligations  to   us  see   item   1     business     certain   government
regulations  reimbursement above

  risk factors related to liability claims and insurance costs

     longterm  care  facility operators  assisted  living and  skilled nursing
facilities have experienced substantial increases  in both the number and  size
of  patient care liability claims in recent years particularly in the states of
texas and florida as  a result general and  professional liability costs  have
increased  and may  continue to  increase nationwide  longterm care liability
insurance rates are increasing because of large jury awards in states like texas
and florida  over the  past two  years  both texas  and florida  have  adopted
skilled  nursing  facility liability  laws that  modify  or limit  tort damages
despite some of these reforms the longterm care industry overall continues  to
experience  very  high  general  and  professional  liability  costs  insurance
companies have  responded to  this claim  crisis by  severely restricting  their
capacity to write longterm care general and professional liability policies no
assurances  can  be  given  that  the climate  for  longterm  care  general and
professional liability insurance will improve in any of the foregoing states  or
any  other  states  where  the facility  operators  conduct  business insurance
companies may  continue  to reduce  or  stop writing  general  and  professional
liability  policies for  skilled nursing  and assisted  living facilities thus
general professional  liability insurance  coverage may  be restricted  or  very
costly  which may adversely  affect the facility  operators future operations
cash flows and financial  condition and may have  a material adverse effect  on
the facility operators ability to meet their obligations to us

  risk factors related to acquisitions

     we are exposed to the risk that our future acquisitions may not prove to be
successful  we  could  encounter  unanticipated  difficulties  and expenditures
relating to any acquired properties including contingent liabilities and newly
acquired properties might  require significant management  attention that  would
otherwise   be  devoted  to  our  ongoing  business  if  we  agree  to  provide
construction financing to an operator and  the project is not completed we  may
need  to take  steps to ensure  completion of the  project or we  could lose the
property moreover if we issue equity  securities or incur additional debt  or
both  to finance  future acquisitions  it may  reduce our  per share financial
results these costs may negatively affect our results of operations

  risk factors related to environmental laws

     under various federal and  state laws owners or  operators of real  estate
may  be  required to  respond  to the  release  of hazardous  substances  on the
property and  may be  held  liable for  property  damage personal  injuries  or
penalties  that result from environmental  contamination these laws also expose
us to the  possibility that  we become liable  to reimburse  the government  for
damages  and costs  it incurs in  connection with  the contamination generally
such liability attaches to  a person based on  the persons relationship to  the
property  our lessees or borrowers are  primarily responsible for the condition
of the property and since we are  a passive landlord we do not participate  in
the  management of  any property  in which  we have  an interest  moreover we
review environmental site assessments of the properties that we own or  encumber
prior  to taking an interest in them those assessments are designed to meet the
all  appropriate  inquiry  standard  which  qualifies  us  for  the  innocent
purchaser   defense  if   environmental  liabilities  arise   based  upon  such
assessments we  do  not believe  that  any of  our  properties are  subject  to
material  environmental contamination however environmental liabilities may be
present in our  properties and we  may incur costs  to remediate  contamination
which  could  have  a  material  adverse effect  on  our  business  or financial
condition

  risk factors related to reinvestment of sale proceeds

     from time to time  we will have  cash available from  1 the proceeds  of
sales  of  shares  of  our  securities  2  principal  payments  on  our loans
receivable and 3 the sale of properties including nonelective  dispositions
under  the terms of master leases  or similar financial support arrangements we
must reinvest these proceeds on a timely basis in health care investments  or
in qualified shortterm investments we compete for real estate investments with
a  broad  variety  of  potential  investors  this  competition  for  attractive
                                        40

investments may  negatively affect  our ability  to make  timely investments  on
terms  acceptable to  us delays in  acquiring properties  may negatively impact
revenues and perhaps our ability to increase our distributions to stockholders

  risk factors related to our structure

     we are also subject to a number of risks on the corporate level first  we
might  fail to qualify or remain qualified as  a reit we intend to operate as a
reit under the internal revenue  code and believe we  have and will continue  to
operate  in such a manner since reit qualification requires us to meet a number
of complex requirements it is possible that we may fail to fulfill them and if
we do our  earnings will  be reduced  by the amount  of federal  taxes owed  a
reduction  in our earnings  would affect the  amount we could  distribute to our
stockholders also if  we were not  a reit we  would not be  required to  make
distributions  to stockholders since a nonreit is not required to pay dividends
to stockholders amounting  to at  least 90 of  its annual  taxable income  see
item  1   business   taxation for  a discussion  of the  provisions of the
internal revenue code that apply to us and the effects of nonqualification

     second our second  restated certificate of  incorporation and amended  and
restated  bylaws contain antitakeover  provisions staggered board provisions
restrictions on share  ownership and  transfer and  super majority  stockholder
approval  requirements  for  business  combinations  that  could  make  it more
difficult for  or even  prevent a  third  party from  acquiring us  without  the
approval  of our incumbent board of directors  further we have a poison pill
rights plan that has antitakeover effects the rights plan if triggered would
cause substantial dilution to a person or  group that attempts to acquire us  on
terms  not approved  by the board  of directors provisions  and agreements that
inhibit or discourage  takeover attempts could  reduce the market  value of  our
common stock

     third  we are  dependent on key  personnel although we  have entered into
employment agreements with our executive officers losing any one of them could
at least temporarily have an adverse impact on our operations we believe  that
losing more than one would have a material adverse impact on our business

item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

     we  are  exposed  to various  market  risks including  the  potential loss
arising from adverse changes in interest rates we seek to mitigate the  effects
of  fluctuations in interest rates by matching the terms of new investments with
new longterm  fixed  rate borrowings  to  the extent  possible  the  following
section  is  presented to  provide  a discussion  of  the risks  associated with
potential fluctuations in interest rates

     we historically  borrow  on  our  lines  of  credit  arrangements  to  make
acquisitions  of  loans to  or to  construct health  care facilities  then as
market conditions dictate we will issue equity or longterm fixed rate debt  to
repay the borrowings under the lines of credit arrangements

     a  change in interest rates will not affect the interest expense associated
with our fixed rate debt interest  rate changes however will affect the  fair
value  of such debt a 1 increase in  interest rates would result in a decrease
in fair value  of our  senior unsecured  notes by  approximately 31473000  at
december  31 2003 15145000  at december 31 2002  changes in the interest
rate environment upon maturity of this fixed  rate debt could have an effect  on
our  future cash flows and  earnings depending on whether  the debt is replaced
with other fixed rate debt with variable rate debt with equity or by the  sale
of assets

     our variable rate debt including our unsecured and secured lines of credit
arrangements  is reflected at fair value at december 31 2003 we did not have
any  borrowings  outstanding  on  our  unsecured  or  secured  lines  of  credit
arrangements  as such a 1 increase in  interest rates would have no effect on
our annual  interest expense  however  as an  example if  borrowings  totaled
50000000  a 1 increase  in interest rates would  result in increased annual
interest expense  of  500000  at  december  31  2002  we  had  113500000
outstanding  related  to this  variable  rate debt  and  assuming no  changes in
outstanding balances a 1 increase in interest rates would result in  increased
annual interest expense of 1135000

     we  are subject to risks associated with debt financing including the risk
that existing  indebtedness may  not be  refinanced or  that the  terms of  such
refinancing  may not be as  favorable as the terms  of current indebtedness the
majority of our borrowings were completed pursuant to indentures or  contractual
agreements  that limit the amount of  indebtedness we may incur accordingly in
the event that we are unable to raise additional equity or borrow money  because
of  these  limitations  our ability  to  acquire additional  properties  may be
limited

     we may or may  not elect to use  financial derivative instruments to  hedge
variable  interest rate  exposure such decisions  are principally  based on our
policy to match our  variable rate investments  with comparable borrowings  but
are  also based on the  general trend in interest  rates at the applicable dates
and our perception of the future volatility of interest rates

skilled nursing facilities

skilled nursing facilities provide inpatient skilled nursing and personal care
services as well as rehabilitative restorative and transitional medical
services in some instances skilled nursing facilities supplement hospital care
by providing specialized care for medically complex patients whose conditions
require intense medical and therapeutic services but who are medically stable
enough to have these services provided in facilities that are less expensive
than acute care hospitals

specialty care facilities

our specialty care facilities include acute care hospitals longterm acute care
hospitals and other specialty care hospitals acute care hospitals provide a
wide range of inpatient and outpatient services including but not limited to
surgery rehabilitation therapy and clinical laboratories longterm acute care
hospitals provide inpatient services for patients with complex medical
conditions that require more intensive care monitoring or emergency support
than that available in most skilled nursing facilities other specialty care
hospitals provide specialized inpatient and outpatient services for specific
illnesses or diseases including among others orthopedic neurosurgical and
behavioral care services

investments

we invest in income producing health care facilities with a primary focus on
longterm care facilities which include skilled nursing and assisted living
facilities we also invest in specialty care facilities we diversify our
investment portfolio by operator and geographic location

in determining whether to invest in a facility we focus on the following a
the experience of the management team b the historical and projected
financial and operational performance of the facility c the credit of the
tenant or borrower d the security for the lease or loan and e the capital
committed to the facility by the tenant or borrower we conduct market research
and analysis for all potential investments in addition we review the value of
all facilities the interest rates and debt service coverage requirements of any
debt to be assumed and the anticipated sources for repayment of any debt

our investments are primarily operating leases and mortgage loans construction
financing is provided but only as a part of a longterm operating lease or
mortgage loan substantially all of our investments are designed with escalating
rate structures depending upon market conditions we believe that appropriate
new investments will be available in the future with substantially the same
spreads over our costs of capital

operating leases and mortgage loans are normally credit enhanced by guaranties
andor letters of credit in addition operating leases are typically structured
as master leases and mortgage loans are generally crossdefaulted and
crosscollateralized with other mortgage loans operating leases or agreements
between the company and the operator and its affiliates

at december 31 2002 88 of our owned real property was subject to master
leases a master lease is a lease of multiple facilities from us to one tenant
entity under a single lease agreement from time to time we may acquire
additional facilities that are then leased to the tenant under the master lease
the tenant is required to make one monthly payment that represents rent on all
the properties that are subject to the master lease typically the master lease
tenant can exercise its right to purchase the facilities or to renew the lease
only with respect to all leased facilities at the same time this bundling
feature benefits us because the tenant cannot limit the purchase or renewal to
the better performing facilities and terminate the leasing arrangement with
respect to the poorer performing facilities this spreads our risk among the
entire group of facilities within the master lease the bundling feature may
provide a similar advantage if the master lease tenant is in bankruptcy subject
to certain restrictions a debtor in bankruptcy has the right to assume or
reject each of its leases it is our intent that a tenant who is in bankruptcy
would be required to assume or reject the master lease as a whole rather than
making the decision on a facility by facility basis

we typically invest in or finance up to 90 of the appraised value of a
property economic terms normally include annual rate increases and fair market
value based purchase options in operating leases

we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type
of health care facility and operator our monitoring process includes review of
monthly financial statements for each facility quarterly review of operator
credit annual facility inspections and review of covenant compliance relating
to licensure real estate taxes letters of credit and other collateral in
monitoring our portfolio our personnel use a proprietary database to collect
and analyze facilityspecific data additionally we conduct extensive research
to ascertain industry trends and risks

through monitoring and research we evaluate the operating environment in each
facilitys market to determine whether payment risk is likely to increase when
we identify unacceptable levels of payment risk we seek to mitigate eliminate
or transfer the risk we typically categorize the risk as operator facility or
market risk for operator risk we typically find a substitute operator to run
the facility for facility risk we usually work with the operator to institute
facility level management changes to address the risk finally for market risk


                                      4
page


we often encourage an operator to change its capital structure including
refinancing or raising additional equity through these monitoring and research
efforts we are typically able to intervene at an early stage and address
payment risk

operating leases

each facility which includes the land buildings improvements and related
rights owned by us is leased to an operator pursuant to a longterm operating
lease as discussed above most of our leased properties are subject to master
leases the leases generally have a fixed term of 10 to 15 years and contain one
or more five to 10year renewal options each lease is a net lease requiring the
tenant to pay rent and all additional charges incurred in the operation of the
leased property the tenants are required to repair rebuild and maintain the
leased properties

the net value of our completed leased properties aggregated approximately
1286985000 at december 31 2002 the straightline rents on the original
lease basis of our completed leased properties are approximately 119 per annum
on average at december 31 2002 our rental yield from leases depends upon a
number of factors including the initial rent charged upfront fees and any
rental adjustments the base rents for the renewal periods are generally fixed
rents set at a spread above the treasury yield for the corresponding period

we currently provide for construction of a facility by the tenant as a part of a
longterm operating lease we capitalize certain interest costs associated with
funds used to finance the construction of properties owned directly by us the
amount capitalized is based upon the borrowings outstanding during the
construction period using the rate of interest that approximates our cost of
financing our interest expense is reduced by the amount capitalized we also
typically charge a commitment fee at the commencement of construction the
construction period commences upon funding and terminates upon the earlier of
the completion of the applicable facility or the end of a specified period
generally 12 to 18 months during the construction period we purchase completed
construction from the operator in accordance with agreed upon terms and
conditions which require among other things a site visit by a company
representative during the construction period we generally require additional
credit enhancement in the form of payment and performance bonds andor
completion guaranties at december 31 2002 we had outstanding construction
financings of 19833000 for leased properties and were committed to providing
additional financing of approximately 42885000 to complete construction

mortgage loans

our investments in mortgage loans are typically structured to provide us with
interest income principal amortization and commitment fees and are generally
secured by a first mortgage lien

at december 31 2002 the average interest rate was approximately 119 per
annum on our outstanding mortgage loan balances our yield on mortgage loans
depends upon a number of factors including the stated interest rate average
principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan the amount of the
commitment fee charged at the inception of the loan and any interest rate
adjustments

the mortgage loans made through december 31 2002 are generally subject to seven
to 10year terms with 25year amortization schedules that provide for a balloon
payment of the outstanding principal balance at the end of the term generally
the mortgage loans provide five to seven years of prepayment protection

subdebt investments

subdebt investments are unsecured loans made to operators of facilities
generally these instruments are for five to sevenyear terms at december 31
2002 the average interest rate was approximately 134 per annum on our
outstanding subdebt investment balances at december 31 2002 we had provided
subdebt financing to four operators

equity investments

we have an investment in atlantic healthcare finance lp a property group that
specializes in the financing through sale and leaseback transactions of
nursing and care homes located in the united kingdom this investment is
accounted for under the equity method of accounting because we have the ability
to exercise significant influence but not control over the company due to our
31 ownership interest

other equity investments which consist of investments in private and public
companies for which we do not have the ability to exercise influence are
accounted for under the cost method under the cost method of accounting
investments in private companies are carried at cost and are adjusted only for
otherthantemporary declines in fair value distributions of earnings and
additional investments for investments in public companies that have readily
determinable fair market values we classify our equity investments as
availableforsale and accordingly record these investments at their fair
market values with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other
comprehensive income a separate component of stockholders equity these
investments represent a minimal ownership interest in these companies

borrowing policies

we may incur longterm indebtedness through public offerings or private
placements to institutional investors for shortterm purposes we may from
time to time obtain lines of credit or other shortterm borrowings from banks
or others

when terms are deemed favorable we may invest in properties subject to existing
mortgage indebtedness in addition we may obtain financing for unleveraged
properties in which we have invested or may refinance properties acquired on a
leveraged basis

under documents pertaining to existing indebtedness we are subject to various
restrictions with respect to secured and unsecured indebtedness

health law matters  generally

we invest in assisted living skilled nursing and specialty care facilities
which represent approximately 57 35 and 8 respectively of our investments
at december 31 2002

typically operators of assisted living facilities do not receive significant
funding from governmental programs and are regulated by the states not the
federal government operators of skilled nursing and specialty care facilities
are subject to federal and state laws that relate to the quality of the medical
andor nursing care provided ancillary services eg respiratory
occupational physical and infusion therapy qualifications of the
administrative personnel and nursing staff the adequacy of the physical plant
and equipment distribution of pharmaceuticals reimbursement and rate setting
and operating policies in addition as described below some of our facility
operators are subject to extensive laws and regulations pertaining to health
care fraud and abuse including kickbacks physician selfreferrals and false
claims

licensing

the primary regulations that affect assisted living facilities are the states
licensing laws in granting and renewing these licenses the regulatory
authorities consider numerous factors that relate directly to a facilitys
physical plant and operations including but not limited to admission and
discharge standards and staffing and training in general a decision to grant or
renew a license is also affected by a facilitys record with respect to consumer
rights and medication guidelines and rules

generally our skilled nursing and specialty care facilities are required to be
licensed on an annual or biannual basis and to be certified for participation
in the medicare and medicaid programs through various regulatory agencies that
determine compliance with federal state and local laws the failure of our
facility operators to maintain or renew any required license or regulatory
approval could prevent them from continuing operations at a property in
addition if a facility is found out of compliance with the conditions of
participation in medicare medicaid or other health care programs or if a
facility is otherwise excluded from those programs the facility may be barred
from participation in government health insurance programs any of these
occurrences may impair the ability of our operators to meet their obligations to
us if we have to replace a facility operator our ability to replace the
operator may be affected by federal and state rules and policies governing
changes in control under current medicare and medicaid rules and regulations
and provider contracts a successor operator that assumes an existing provider
agreement will typically be subject to certain liabilities of the previous
operator including overpayments underpayments terms under any existing plan
of correction and possibly sanctions and penalties if a successor operator
chooses to apply for a new medicare provider agreement the successor operator
may experience interruptions and delays in reimbursement during the processing
of its application for a new provider agreement this may result in delays an
inability to find a replacement operator a significant working capital
commitment from us to a new operator or other difficulties

reimbursement

assisted living facilities almost all of the revenues received by the operators
of our assisted living facilities are from private pay sources including social
security with a small amount from medicaid waiver programs approximately 63
of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2002 were attributable to
assisted living facilities at december 31 2002 only six of our 27 assisted
living operators utilized medicaid waivers and medicaid residents are generally
a small percentage of total census at each of these facilities

rates paid by selfpay residents are set by the facilities and are largely
determined by local market conditions and operating costs generally facilities
receive a higher payment per day for a selfpay or private insurance patient
than for a medicaid beneficiary who requires a comparable level of care thus
the revenues generated by operators of our assisted living facilities may be
adversely affected by the mix of the patients their payment sources the acuity
level of care required and reductions in reimbursement levels which could in
turn have a material adverse effect on an operators ability to meet their
obligations to us

most states have medicaid waiver programs that allow medicaid recipients to use
benefits for alternatives to skilled nursing such as assisted living the
national academy for state health policy reports that medicaid waiver programs
served about 102000 residents in assisted living or residential care settings
in 2002 the level of reimbursement varies significantly from state to state
but rarely includes reimbursement for the rental portion of the monthly rate in
addition some operators are hesitant to accept medicaid residents because
participation in the waiver program often entails increased state oversight and
regulatory requirements

skilled nursing facilities and specialty care facilities skilled nursing and
specialty care facilities typically receive most of their revenues from medicare
and medicaid with the balance representing private pay including private
insurance consequently skilled nursing and specialty care facilities rely
heavily on government reimbursement of capital and operating expenses changes
in federal or state reimbursement policies including changes in payment rates
as a result of federal or state regulatory action or delays by fiscal
intermediaries may also adversely affect an operators ability to cover its
expenses skilled nursing and specialty care facilities are subject to periodic
pre and postpayment reviews and other audits by federal and state authorities
a review or audit of claims against a

facility operator could result in recoupments denials or delays of payments in
the future which could have a material adverse effect on the operators ability
to meet its obligations to us due to the significant judgments and estimates
inherent in payor settlement accounting no assurance can be given as to the
adequacy of any reserves maintained by our facility operators for potential
adjustments to reimbursements for payor settlements due to budgetary
constraints governmental payors often limit payments to skilled nursing and
specialty care facilities as a result of government reimbursement programs
being subject to such budgetary pressures and legislative and administrative
actions an operators ability to meet its obligations to us may be
significantly impaired

medicare reimbursement and skilled nursing facilities for the third quarter
ended september 30 2002 approximately 15 of the revenue sources from our
skilled nursing facilities which comprised 33 of our revenues for the year
ended december 31 2002 were directly attributable to medicare reimbursement
in an effort to reduce federal spending on health care the federal government
enacted the balanced budget act of 1997 which contained extensive changes to the
medicare and medicaid programs intended to reduce the projected payments under
these programs the balanced budget act of 1997 fundamentally altered medicare
payment methodologies for skilled nursing facilities by mandating the
institution of the skilled nursing facility prospective payment system this
system differs significantly from the prior cost based reimbursement system
among other things it sets per diem rates based on 1995 cost reports as
adjusted by a variety of factors including but not limited to costs
associated with 44 patient utilization group categories the payments received
under the skilled nursing facility prospective payment system cover services for
medicare patients including all ancillary services such as respiratory
physical and occupational therapy and certain covered medications the skilled
nursing facility prospective payment system caused medicare spending for skilled
nursing facility services to decrease and those reductions in medicare payments
resulted in immediate financial difficulties thereby causing a number of skilled
nursing facility operators to seek bankruptcy protection

since the balanced budget acts passage in 1997 the federal government has
taken steps to ameliorate the financial impact on affected providers for
example under the balanced budget refinement act and the benefits improvement
and patient protection act of 2000 some of the mandatory reductions in medicare
payment increases were reversed or delayed and skilled nursing facilities
received temporary per diem payment increases for certain high cost patients
however the relief prescribed by these laws rules and regulations expired as
of september 30 2002

the medicare program announced in july 2002 that skilled nursing facilities
would receive a 26 increase in medicare payments for federal fiscal year 2003
resulting in nearly 400 million more in overall reimbursement and that no
refinements would be made to the existing casemix classification system for
fiscal year 2003 the expectation that skilled nursing facilities will continue
to receive an estimated 1 billion in temporary addon payments until federal
fiscal year 2004 will be offset however by the expiration of other temporary
addon payments previously provided by the balanced budget refinement act and
the benefits improvement and patient protection act of 2000 the loss of these
temporary addon payments will result in an overall decrease in federal fiscal
year 2003 payments as compared to fiscal year 2002 payments additionally it is
unclear how potential casemix refinements if eventually implemented may
impact medicare reimbursement to skilled nursing facility operators thus
despite some temporary payment relief the skilled nursing facility prospective
payment system has resulted and will likely continue to result in reduced
reimbursement for operators of skilled nursing facilities as compared to prior
years

medicare reimbursement and specialty care facilities for the third quarter
ended september 30 2002 approximately 33 of the revenue sources from our
specialty care facilities which comprised 4 of our revenues for the year ended
december 31 2002 were directly attributable to medicare some of these
facilities are acute care hospitals that provide a wide range of inpatient and
outpatient services including but not limited to surgery rehabilitation
therapy and clinical laboratories other of these facilities are longterm acute
care hospitals that provide inpatient services for patients with complex medical
conditions that require more intensive care monitoring or emergency support
than that available in most skilled nursing facilities some of our other
specialty care facilities provide specialized inpatient and outpatient services
for specific illnesses or diseases including among others orthopedic
neurosurgical and behavioral care services

hospitals are reimbursed by medicare under prospective payment system
reimbursement methodologies reimbursement for these facilities is determined on
the basis of fixed prospective rates in some cases a hospital might be able
to qualify for an outlier payment if the hospitals charges exceed a threshold
the center for medicare and medicaid services is reevaluating its outlier
methodology in response to allegations that some hospitals increased their
outlier reimbursement by substantially increasing charges if any of the
operators of our specialty care facilities were found to have substantially
increased charges in an attempt to increase outlier payments there is a risk
that such operators could be investigated and required to refund a portion of
outlier payments received plus possible penalties

congress has limited increases in prospective payment system payments these
limited increases may not be sufficient to cover specialty care facilities
increasing costs of providing care failure to increase reimbursement to cover
increased costs or reductions or freezes in payment rates will have an adverse
impact on operators of our specialty care facilities

the inpatient rehabilitation facilities are in the midst of fundamental changes
in how they are reimbursed by medicare these facilities had been reimbursed on
the basis of reasonable costs however these facilities are now being reimbursed
on the basis of a new prospective payment system for inpatient rehabilitation
facilities including freestanding rehabilitation hospitals and rehabilitation
units of acute care hospitals under the inpatient rehabilitation facility
prospective payment system rehabilitation hospitals beginning in january 2002
were required to complete a patient assessment instrument upon admission and
discharge for all medicare part a feeforservice patients each patient is
placed into a functionalrelated group on the basis of impairment age
comorbidities functional capability of the patient and other factors the
medicare program deems appropriate to improve the explanatory power of
functional independence measure function related groups the group determines
the base payment rate for the medicarecovered part a services furnished by the
inpatient rehabilitation facility during the beneficiarys episode of care
inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system rates encompass the
inpatient capital costs and operating costs including routine and ancillary
costs of furnishing covered rehabilitation services other indirect operating
costs including among other things bad debts approved educational activities
and nonphysician anesthetists services are not included

the ability of our operators of inpatient rehabilitation facilities to adjust to
the shift from reasonable cost reimbursement to the prospective payment system
will impact the cash flow of these facilities failure to control costs or
manage the care provided under the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective
payment system would have an adverse impact on our operators ability to meet
their obligations to us

medicaid reimbursement medicaid a cooperative federalstate program providing
health coverage for the indigent is the primary payor source for residents in
our skilled nursing and specialty care facilities for the third quarter ended
september 30 2002 approximately 65 of the revenues of our skilled nursing
facilities and 53 of the revenues of our specialty care facilities were
attributable to medicaid payments the federal government and the states share
responsibility for financing medicaid the federal matching rate known as the
federal medicaid assistance percentage varies by state based on changes in per
capita income currently many state medicaid programs use a costbased
reimbursement system in which the rate that a facility receives may be based on
the costs it historically incurred in providing patient care many of these
programs compute a per diem rate of reimbursement that is applied prospectively
certain states provide for efficiency incentives subject to cost ceilings
reasonable costs typically include allowances for administrative and general
costs and costs of property and equipment eg depreciation and fair rental
many of these programs are subject to retrospective adjustment under which a
facility operator might be required to refund payments that exceed incurred
costs

states are facing increasingly difficult fiscal conditions personal income and
corporate tax revenues are declining due to the downturn in the economy the
weak economy also strains social service programs because medicaid is
meanstested and more people qualify for assistance as incomes fall further
the population continues to age regardless of economic conditions and health
care costs particularly for prescription drugs continue to increase above the
rate of inflation therefore the demands under the medicaid system are
increasing during a period when the pressure is mounting to cut state
expenditures in order to balance budgets medicaid is typically the second
largest item in state budgets after elementary and secondary education in most
states medicaid does not fully reimburse the cost of providing skilled nursing
services furthermore the balanced budget act of 1997 repealed the boren
amendment which required states to fund medicaid expenditures in an amount that
would allow operators to provide care in conformity with applicable laws and
safety standards consequently medicaid funding is vulnerable to state balanced
budget requirements the federal medicaid assistance percentage although
designed to change in relation to changes in a states per capita income lags
the states changing economic conditions consequently states may be forced to
decrease medicaid expenditures or slow the rate of growth by freezing rates or
restricting eligibility budget shortfall projections are inexact estimates that
are ultimately determined by actual tax collections nonetheless the scale and
scope of the current shortfalls as reported by the national conference of state
legislatures make it clear that many states will be forced to reduce spending in
order to balance their budgets for fiscal year 2003

the reimbursement methodologies applied to health care facilities continue to
evolve federal and state authorities have considered and may seek to implement
new or modified reimbursement methodologies that may negatively impact health
care facility operations these changes if implemented may result in a
material adverse effect on our skilled nursing and specialty care facility
operations no assurance can be given that current revenue sources or levels
will be maintained accordingly there can be no assurance that payments under a
government reimbursement program are currently or will in the future be
sufficient to fully reimburse the facility operators for their operating and
capital expenses as a result the operators ability to meet their obligations
to us could be adversely impacted

other related laws

skilled nursing and specialty care facilities and assisted living facilities
that receive medicaid payments are subject to federal state and local laws and
regulations including those laws and regulations prohibiting fraud and abuse
which govern the operations and financial and other arrangements that may be
entered into by health care providers certain of these laws prohibit direct or
indirect payments of any kind for the purpose of inducing or encouraging the
referral of patients for medical products or services reimbursable by
governmental programs other laws require providers to furnish only medically
necessary services and submit to the government valid and accurate statements
for each service still other laws require providers to comply with a variety of
safety health and other requirements relating to the condition of the licensed
facility and the quality of care provided sanctions for violation of these laws
and regulations may include but are not limited to criminal andor civil
penalties and fines and a loss of licensure and immediate termination of
governmental payments in certain circumstances violation of certain rules
such as those prohibiting abusive and fraudulent behavior with respect to one
facility may subject other facilities under common control or ownership to
sanctions including disqualification from participation in the medicare and
medicaid programs in the ordinary course of its business a facility operator
is regularly subjected to inquiries investigations and audits by federal and
state agencies that oversee these laws and regulations

each skilled nursing and specialty care facility and any assisted living
facility that receives medicaid payments is subject to the federal
antikickback statute which generally prohibits persons from offering
providing soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce either the referral of
an individual or the furnishing of a good or service for which payment may be
made under a federal health care program such as the medicare and medicaid
programs skilled nursing and specialty care facilities are also subject to the
federal ethics in patient referral act of 1989 commonly referred to as the
stark law the stark law generally prohibits the submission of claims to
medicare for payment if the claim results from a physician referral for certain
designated services and the physician has a financial relationship with the
health service provider that does not qualify under one of the exceptions for a
financial relationship under the stark law similar prohibitions on physician
selfreferrals and submission of claims apply to state medicaid programs
further skilled nursing and specialty care facilities and assisted living
facilities that receive medicaid payments are subject to substantial financial
penalties under the civil monetary penalties act and the false claims act and
in particular actions under the false claims acts whistleblower provisions
private enforcement of health care fraud has increased due in large part to
amendments to the false claims act that encourage private individuals to sue on
behalf of the government these whistleblower suits by private individuals
known as qui tam actions may be filed by almost anyone including present and
former patients and nurses and other employees these actions could have a
material adverse effect on a facility operators liquidity financial condition
and results of operations which could adversely affect the ability of the
operator to meet its obligations to us finally various state false claim and
antikickback laws also may apply to each facility operator violation of any of
these statutes can result in criminal andor civil penalties that could have a
material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its obligations to
us

the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 which became
effective january 1 1997 greatly expanded the definition of health care fraud
and related offenses and broadened its scope to include private health care
plans in addition to government payors this law also greatly increased funding
for the department of justice federal bureau of investigation and the office of
the inspector general of the department of health and human services to audit
investigate and prosecute suspected health care fraud additionally the
administrative simplification provisions of this law provide for communication
of health information through standard electronic transaction formats and for
the privacy and security of health information in order to comply with the
regulations health care providers must undergo significant operational and
technical changes and these modifications may represent significant costs for
our health care providers these additional costs may in turn adversely affect
the ability of our operators to meet their obligations to us

finally government investigation and enforcement of health care laws has
increased dramatically over the past several years and is expected to continue
some of these enforcement actions represent novel legal theories and expansions
in the application of false claims laws for example there have been a number
of complaints filed and settlements entered into by the united states attorneys
office in the eastern district of pennsylvania alleging that the failure to meet
certain conditions of participation renders claims for care false on the theory
that inadequate care was provided the costs for an operator of a health care
facility associated with both defending enforcement actions and the undertakings
in settlement agreements can be substantial and could have a material adverse
effect on the ability of an operator to meet its obligations to us

federal state local foreign and other tax consequences of acquiring owning
and selling of our stock

general

we elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust or reit commencing
with our first fiscal year we intend to remain qualified as a reit but there
is no guarantee that we will qualify or remain qualified as a reit for
subsequent years qualification and taxation as a reit depends upon our ability
to meet a variety of qualification tests imposed under federal income tax law
with respect to our income assets distribution level and diversity of share
ownership as discussed below under qualification as a reit

in any year in which we qualify as a reit in general we will not be subject to
federal income tax on that portion of our reit taxable income or capital gain
that is distributed to stockholders we may however be subject to tax at
normal corporate rates on any taxable income or capital gain not distributed if
we elect to retain and pay income tax on our net longterm capital gain
stockholders are required to include their proportionate share of our
undistributed longterm capital gain in income but they will receive a
refundable credit for their share of any taxes paid by us on a gain

despite the reit election we may be subject to federal income and excise tax as
follows

        to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or
          distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our reit taxable
          income as adjusted we will be subject to tax on the undistributed
          amount at regular corporate tax rates

        we may be subject to the alternative minimum tax on certain items of
          tax preference to the extent that this tax exceeds our regular tax

        if we have net income from the sale or other disposition of
          foreclosure property that is held primarily for sale to customers in
          the ordinary course of business or other nonqualifying income from
          foreclosure property we will be subject to tax at the highest
          corporate rate on this income

        any net income from prohibited transactions which are in general
          sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to
          customers in the ordinary course of business other than dispositions
          of foreclosure property and dispositions of property due to an
          involuntary conversion will be subject to a 100 tax

        if we fail to satisfy either the 75 or 95 gross income tests as
          discussed below but nonetheless maintain our qualification as a reit
          because certain other requirements are met we will be subject to a
          100 tax on an amount equal to 1 the gross income attributable to
          the greater of the amounts by which we failed the 75 or 95 test
          multiplied by 2 a fraction intended to reflect our profitability

        if we fail to distribute during each year at least the sum of 1 85
          of our reit ordinary income for the year 2 95 of our reit capital
          gain net income for the year other than capital gain that we elect to
          retain and pay tax on and 3 any undistributed taxable income from
          preceding periods we will be subject to a 4 excise tax on the excess
          of the required distribution over amounts actually distributed and

        we will also be subject to a tax of 100 on the amount of any rents
          from real property deductions or excess interest paid to us by any of
          our taxable reit subsidiaries that would be reduced through
          reapportionment under certain federal income tax principles in order
          to more clearly reflect income of the taxable reit subsidiary see
          other tax considerationsinvestments in taxable reit
          subsidiaries

if we acquire any assets from a corporation which is or has been a c
corporation in a carryover basis transaction we could be liable for specified
liabilities that are inherited from the c corporation a c corporation is
generally defined as a corporation that is required to pay full corporate level
federal income tax if we recognize gain on the disposition of the assets during
the 10year period beginning on the date on which the assets were acquired by
us then to the extent of the assets builtin gain ie the excess of the
fair market value of the asset over the adjusted basis in the asset in each
case determined as of the beginning of the 10year period we will be subject
to tax on the gain at the highest regular corporate rate applicable the results
described in this paragraph with respect to the recognition of builtin gain
assume that the builtin gain assets at the time the builtin gain assets were
subject to a

acquired the assets from a c corporation were not treated as sold to an
unrelated party and gain recognized

qualification as a reit

a reit is defined as a corporation trust or association

     1  which is managed by one or more trustees or directors

     2  the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares
          or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest

     3  which would be taxable as a domestic corporation but for the federal
          income tax law relating to reits

     4  which is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company

     5  the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons in
          each taxable year of the reit except for its first taxable year

     6  not more than 50 in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned
          during the last half of each taxable year excluding its first taxable
          year directly or indirectly by or for five or fewer individuals
          which includes certain entities the five or fewer requirement
          and

     7  which meets certain income and asset tests described below

conditions 1 to 4 inclusive must be met during the entire taxable year and
condition 5 must be met during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12
months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months
for purposes of conditions 5 and 6 pension funds and certain other
taxexempt entities are treated as individuals subject to a lookthrough
exception in the case of condition 6

based on publicly available information we believe we have satisfied the share
ownership requirements set forth in 5 and 6 above in addition our amended
and restated bylaws provide for restrictions regarding ownership and transfer
of shares these restrictions are intended to assist us in continuing to satisfy
the share ownership requirements described in 5 and 6 above these ownership
and transfer restrictions are described in article vi of our amended and
restated bylaws these restrictions however may not ensure that we will in
all cases be able to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in 5
and 6 above

we have complied with and will continue to comply with regulatory rules to
send annual letters to certain of our stockholders requesting information
regarding the actual ownership of our stock if despite sending the annual
letters we do not know or after exercising reasonable diligence would not have
known whether we failed to meet the five or fewer requirement we will be
treated as having met the five or fewer requirement if we fail to comply with
these regulatory rules we will be subject to a monetary penalty if our failure
to comply was due to intentional disregard of the requirement the penalty would
be increased however if our failure to comply was due to reasonable cause and
not willful neglect no penalty would be imposed

we may own a number of properties through wholly owned subsidiaries a
corporation will qualify as a qualified reit subsidiary if 100 of its stock
is owned by a reit and the reit does not elect to treat the subsidiary as a
taxable reit subsidiary a qualified reit subsidiary will not be treated as a
separate corporation and all assets liabilities and items of income
deductions and credits of a qualified reit subsidiary will be treated as
assets liabilities and items as the case may be of the reit a qualified
reit subsidiary is not subject to federal income tax and our ownership of the
voting stock of a qualified reit subsidiary will not violate the restrictions
against ownership of securities of any one issuer which constitute more than 10
of the value or total voting power of the issuer or more than 5 of the value of
our total assets as described below under asset tests

if we invest in a partnership a limited liability company or a trust taxed as a
partnership or as a disregarded entity we will be deemed to own a proportionate
share of the partnerships limited liability companys or trusts assets
likewise we will be treated as receiving our share of the income and loss of
the partnership limited liability company or trust and the gross income will
retain the same character in our hands as it has in the hands of the
partnership limited liability company or trust these lookthrough rules
apply for purposes of the income tests and assets tests described below

income tests there are two separate percentage tests relating to our sources of
gross income that we must satisfy for each taxable year

        at least 75 of our gross income excluding gross income from certain
          sales of property held primarily for sale must be directly or
          indirectly derived each taxable year from rents from real property
          other income from investments relating to real property or mortgages
          on real property or certain income from qualified temporary
          investments

        at least 95 of our gross income excluding gross income from certain
          sales of property held primarily for sale must be directly or
          indirectly derived each taxable year from any of the sources
          qualifying for the 75 test and from dividends including dividends
          from taxable reit subsidiaries interest gain from the sale or
          disposition of stock securities and payments to us under an interest
          rate swap cap agreement option futures contract forward rate
          agreement or any similar financial instrument entered into by us to
          hedge indebtedness incurred or to be incurred

rents received by us will qualify as rents from real property for purposes of
satisfying the gross income tests for a reit only if several conditions are met


                                      12
page


        the amount of rent must not be based in whole or in part on the income
          or profits of any person although rents generally will not be
          excluded merely because they are based on a fixed percentage or
          percentages of receipts or sales

        rents received from a tenant will not qualify as rents from real
          property if the reit or an owner of 10 or more of the reit also
          directly or constructively owns 10 or more of the tenant unless the
          tenant is our taxable reit subsidiary and certain other requirements
          are met with respect to the real property being rented

        if rent attributable to personal property leased in connection with a
          lease of real property is greater than 15 of the total rent received
          under the lease then the portion of rent attributable to the personal
          property will not qualify as rents from real property

        for rents to qualify as rents from real property we generally must
          not furnish or render services to tenants other than through a
          taxable reit subsidiary or an independent contractor from whom we
          derive no income except that we may directly provide services that
          are usually or customarily rendered in the geographic area in which
          the property is located in connection with the rental of real property
          for occupancy only or are not otherwise considered rendered to the
          occupant for his convenience

for taxable years beginning after august 5 1997 a reit has been permitted to
render a de minimis amount of impermissible services to tenants and still treat
amounts received with respect to that property as rent from real property the
amount received or accrued by the reit during the taxable year for the
impermissible services with respect to a property may not exceed 1 of all
amounts received or accrued by the reit directly or indirectly from the
property the amount received for any service or management operation for this
purpose shall be deemed to be not less than 150 of the direct cost of the reit
in furnishing or rendering the service or providing the management or operation
furthermore impermissible services may be furnished to tenants by a taxable
reit subsidiary subject to certain conditions and we may still treat rents
received with respect to the property as rent from real property

the term interest generally does not include any amount if the determination
of the amount depends in whole or in part on the income or profits of any
person although an amount generally will not be excluded from the term
interest solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage of receipts or
sales

if we fail to satisfy one or both of the 75 or 95 gross income tests for any
taxable year we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for the year if we are
eligible for relief these relief provisions will be generally available if

        our failure to meet the tests was due to reasonable cause and not due
          to willful neglect

        we attach a schedule of the sources of our income to our return and

        any incorrect information on the schedule was not due to fraud with
          intent to evade tax

it is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be
entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions if these relief provisions
apply a 100 tax is imposed on an amount equal to a the gross income
attributable to the greater of the amount by which we failed the 75 or 95
test multiplied by b a fraction intended to reflect our profitability

asset tests at the close of each quarter of our taxable year we must also
satisfy several tests relating to the nature and diversification of our assets
determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles at least
75 of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets
cash cash items including receivables arising in the ordinary course of our
operation government securities and qualified temporary investments although
the remaining 25 of our assets generally may be invested without restriction
we are prohibited from owning securities representing more than 10 of either
the vote or value of the outstanding securities of any issuer other than a
qualified reit subsidiary another reit or a taxable reit subsidiary the 10
vote and value test further no more than 20 of the total assets may be
represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries and no more
than 5 of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities of any
nongovernmental issuer other than a qualified reit subsidiary another reit or
a taxable reit subsidiary each of the 10 vote and value test and the 20 and
5 asset tests must be satisfied at the end of any quarter there are special
rules which provide relief if the value related tests are not satisfied due to
changes in the value of the assets of a reit

investments in taxable reit subsidiaries

for taxable years beginning after december 31 2000 reits may own more than 10
of the voting power and value of securities in taxable reit subsidiaries we and
any taxable corporate entity in which we own an interest are allowed to jointly
elect to treat the entity as a taxable reit subsidiary

one of our subsidiaries has elected to be treated as a taxable reit subsidiary
taxable reit subsidiaries are subject to full corporate level federal taxation
on their earnings but are permitted to engage in certain types of activities
which cannot be performed directly by reits without jeopardizing their reit
status our taxable reit subsidiary will attempt to minimize the amount of these
taxes but there can be no assurance whether or the extent to which measures
taken to minimize taxes will be successful to the extent our taxable reit
subsidiary is required to pay federal state or local taxes the cash available
for distribution as dividends to us from our taxable reit subsidiary will be
reduced


                                      13
page


the amount of interest on relatedparty debt that a taxable reit subsidiary may
deduct is limited further a 100 tax applies to any interest payments by a
taxable reit subsidiary to its affiliated reit to the extent the interest rate
is not commercially reasonable a taxable reit subsidiary is permitted to deduct
interest payments to unrelated parties without any of these restrictions

the internal revenue service may reallocate costs between a reit and its taxable
reit subsidiary where there is a lack of armslength dealing between the
parties any deductible expenses allocated away from a taxable reit subsidiary
would increase its tax liability further any amount by which a reit
understates its deductions and overstates those of its taxable reit subsidiary
will subject to certain exceptions be subject to a 100 tax

additional taxable reit subsidiary elections may be made in the future for
additional entities in which we own an interest

annual distribution requirements we are in order to avoid being taxed as a
regular corporation required to make distributions other than capital gain
distributions to our stockholders which qualify for the dividends paid
deduction in an amount at least equal to a the sum of i 90 of our reit
taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our
net capital gain and ii 90 of the aftertax net income if any from
foreclosure property minus b a portion of certain items of noncash income
these distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate or in
the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for
that year and if paid on or before the first regular distribution payment after
the declaration the amount distributed must not be preferential this means
that every stockholder of the class of stock to which a distribution is made
must be treated the same as every other stockholder of that class and no class
of stock may be treated otherwise than in accordance with its dividend rights as
a class to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or
distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our reit taxable income as
adjusted we will be subject to tax on the undistributed amount at regular
corporate tax rates finally as discussed above we may be subject to an excise
tax if we fail to meet certain other distribution requirements we intend to
make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy these annual distribution
requirements

it is possible that we from time to time may not have sufficient cash or other
liquid assets to meet the 90 distribution requirement or to distribute the
greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation due to
among other things a timing differences between i the actual receipt of
income and actual payment of deductible expenses and ii the inclusion of
income and deduction of expenses in arriving at our taxable income or b the
payment of severance benefits that may not be deductible to us in the event
that timing differences occur we may find it necessary to arrange for
borrowings or if possible pay dividends in the form of taxable stock dividends
in order to meet the distribution requirement

under certain circumstances in the event of a deficiency determined by the
internal revenue service we may be able to rectify a resulting failure to meet
the distribution requirement for a year by paying deficiency dividends to
stockholders in a later year which may be included in our deduction for
distributions paid for the earlier year thus we may be able to avoid being
taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency distributions however we will be
required to pay applicable penalties and interest based upon the amount of any
deduction taken for deficiency distributions

failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust

if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year we will be
subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax
on our taxable income at regular corporate rates distributions to stockholders
in any year in which we fail to qualify as a reit will not be deductible nor
will any particular amount of distributions be required to be made in any year
all distributions to stockholders will be taxable as ordinary income to the
extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these
distributions and subject to certain limitations will be eligible for the
dividends received deduction for corporate stockholders unless entitled to
relief under specific statutory provisions we also will be disqualified from
taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which
qualification was lost it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances
we would be entitled to statutory relief failure to qualify for even one year
could result in our need to incur indebtedness or liquidate investments in order
to pay potentially significant resulting tax liabilities

federal income taxation of stockholders

treatment of taxable us stockholders the following summary applies to you
only if you are a us stockholder a us stockholder is a stockholder of
shares of stock who for united states federal income tax purposes is

        a citizen or resident of the united states

        a corporation partnership or other entity created or organized in or
          under the laws of the united states or of any state or in the district
          of columbia unless in the case of a partnership treasury
          regulations provide otherwise

        an estate the income of which is subject to united states federal
          income taxation regardless of its source or

        a trust whose administration is subject to the primary supervision of
          a united states court and which has one or more united states persons
          who have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the
          trust

so long as we qualify for taxation as a reit distributions on shares of our
stock made out of the current or accumulated earnings and profits allocable to
these distributions and not designated as capital gain dividends will be
includable as ordinary income for federal income tax purposes none of these
distributions will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for us
corporate stockholders


                                      14
page


distributions that are designated as capital gain dividends will be taxed as
longterm capital gains to the extent they do not exceed our actual net capital
gain for the taxable year without regard to the period for which you held our
stock however if you are a corporation you may be required to treat a portion
of some capital gain dividends as ordinary income

if we elect to retain and pay income tax on any net longterm capital gain you
would include in income as longterm capital gain your proportionate share of
this net longterm capital gain you would also receive a refundable tax credit
for your proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these retained capital
gains and you would have an increase in the basis of your shares of our stock in
an amount equal to your includable capital gains less your share of the tax
deemed paid

you may not include in your federal income tax return any of our net operating
losses or capital losses federal income tax rules may also require that certain
minimum tax adjustments and preferences be apportioned to you in addition any
distribution declared by us in october november or december of any year on a
specified date in any such month shall be treated as both paid by us and
received by you on december 31 of that year provided that the distribution is
actually paid by us no later than january 31 of the following year

we will be treated as having sufficient earnings and profits to treat as a
dividend any distribution up to the amount required to be distributed in order
to avoid imposition of the 4 excise tax discussed under general and
qualification as a reit  annual distribution requirements above as a
result you may be required to treat as taxable dividends certain distributions
that would otherwise result in a taxfree return of capital moreover any
deficiency dividend will be treated as a dividend an ordinary dividend or a
capital gain dividend as the case may be regardless of our earnings and
profits any other distributions in excess of current or accumulated earnings
and profits will not be taxable to you to the extent these distributions do not
exceed the adjusted basis of your shares of our stock you will be required to
reduce the tax basis of your shares of our stock by the amount of these
distributions until the basis has been reduced to zero after which these
distributions will be taxable as capital gain if the shares of our stock are
held as a capital asset the tax basis as so reduced will be used in computing
the capital gain or loss if any realized upon sale of the shares of our stock
any loss upon a sale or exchange of shares of our stock which were held for six
months or less after application of certain holding period rules will
generally be treated as a longterm capital loss to the extent you previously
received capital gain distributions with respect to these shares of our stock

upon the sale or exchange of any shares of our stock to or with a person other
than us or a sale or exchange of all shares of our stock whether actually or
constructively owned with us you will generally recognize capital gain or loss
equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and
your adjusted tax basis in these shares of our stock this gain will be capital
gain if you held these shares of our stock as a capital asset

gain from the sale or exchange of our shares held for more than one year is
taxed at a maximum longterm capital gain rate which is currently 20 some
taxpayers may be eligible for a lower longterm capital gain rate if our shares
are acquired after december 31 2000 and held for at least five years pursuant
to internal revenue service guidance we may classify portions of our capital
gain dividends as gains eligible for the longterm capital gains rate or as gain
taxable to individual stockholders at a maximum rate of 25

treatment of taxexempt us stockholders taxexempt entities including
qualified employee pension and profit sharing trusts and individual retirement
accounts exempt organizations generally are exempt from federal income
taxation however they are subject to taxation on their unrelated business
taxable income ubti the internal revenue service has issued a published
revenue ruling that dividend distributions from a reit to an exempt employee
pension trust do not constitute ubti provided that the shares of the reit are
not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business of the exempt employee
pension trust based on this ruling amounts distributed by us to exempt
organizations generally should not constitute ubti however if an exempt
organization finances its acquisition of the shares of our stock with debt a
portion of its income from us will constitute ubti pursuant to the debt
financed property rules likewise a portion of the exempt organizations
income from us would constitute ubti if we held a residual interest in a real
estate mortgage investment conduit

in addition in certain circumstances a pension trust that owns more than 10
of our stock is required to treat a percentage of our dividends as ubti this
rule applies to a pension trust holding more than 10 of our stock only if i
the percentage of our income that is ubti determined as if we were a pension
trust is at least 5 ii we qualify as a reit by reason of the modification
of the five or fewer requirement that allows beneficiaries of the pension trust
to be treated as holding shares in proportion to their actuarial interests in
the pension trust and iii either a one pension trust owns more than 25 of
the value of our stock or b a group of pension trusts individually holding
more than 10 of the value of our stock collectively own more than 50 of the
value of our stock

backup withholding and information reporting under certain circumstances you
may be subject to backup withholding at applicable rates on payments made with
respect to or cash proceeds of a sale or exchange of shares of our stock
backup withholding will apply only if you

        fail to furnish your taxpayer identification number tin to the
          person required to withhold

        furnish an incorrect tin

        are notified by the internal revenue service that you have failed to
          properly report payments of interest and dividends or


                                      15
page


        under certain circumstances fail to certify under penalty of
          perjury that you have furnished a correct tin and have not been
          notified by the internal revenue service that you are subject to
          backup withholding for failure to report interest and dividend
          payments

backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain
exempt recipients such as corporations and taxexempt organizations you should
consult with a tax advisor regarding qualification for exemption from backup
withholding and the procedure for obtaining an exemption backup withholding is
not an additional tax rather the amount of any backup withholding with respect
to payment to a stockholder will be allowed as a credit against the
stockholders united states federal income tax liability and may entitle the
stockholder to a refund provided that the required information is provided to
the internal revenue service in addition withholding a portion of capital gain
distributions made to stockholders may be required for stockholders who fail to
certify their nonforeign status

taxation of foreign stockholders the following summary applies to you only if
you are a foreign person the federal taxation of foreign persons is a highly
complex matter that may be affected by many considerations

distributions to you of cash generated by our real estate operations but not by
the sale or exchange of our capital assets generally will be subject to us
withholding tax at a rate of 30 unless an applicable tax treaty reduces that
tax and you file with us the required form evidencing the lower rate

in general you will be subject to united states federal income tax on a
graduated rate basis rather than withholding with respect to your investment in
our stock if the investment is effectively connected with your conduct of a
trade or business in the united states a corporate foreign stockholder that
receives income that is or is treated as effectively connected with a united
states trade or business may also be subject to the branch profits tax which is
payable in addition to regular united states corporate income tax the following
discussion will apply to foreign stockholders whose investment in us is not so
effectively connected we expect to withhold united states income tax as
described below on the gross amount of any distributions paid to you unless i
you file an internal revenue service form w8eci with us claiming that the
distribution is effectively connected or ii certain other exceptions apply

distributions by us that are attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a
united states real property interest will be taxed to you under the foreign
investment in real property tax act of 1980 firpta as if these distributions
were gains effectively connected with a united states trade or business
accordingly you will be taxed at the normal capital gain rates applicable to a
us stockholder on these amounts subject to any applicable alternative minimum
tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien
individuals distributions subject to firpta may also be subject to a branch
profits tax in the hands of a corporate foreign stockholder that is not entitled
to treaty exemption

we will be required to withhold from distributions subject to firpta and remit
to the internal revenue service 35 of designated capital gain dividends or
if greater 35 of the amount of any distributions that could be designated as
capital gain dividends in addition if we designate prior distributions as
capital gain dividends subsequent distributions up to the amount of the prior
distributions not withheld against will be treated as capital gain dividends
for purposes of withholding

unless our shares constitute a united states real property interest within the
meaning of firpta or are effectively connected with a us trade or business a
sale of our shares by you generally will not be subject to united states
taxation our shares will not constitute a united states real property interest
if we qualify as a domestically controlled reit we do and expect to continue
to qualify as a domestically controlled reit a domestically controlled reit is
a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50 in
value of its shares is held directly or indirectly by foreign stockholders
however if you are a nonresident alien individual who is present in the united
states for 183 days or more during the taxable year and certain other conditions
apply you will be subject to a 30 tax on capital gains in any event a
purchaser of our shares from you will not be required under firpta to withhold
on the purchase price if the purchased shares are regularly traded on an
established securities market or if we are a domestically controlled reit
otherwise under firpta the purchaser may be required to withhold 10 of the
purchase price and remit that amount to the internal revenue service

backup withholding tax and information reporting will generally not apply to
distributions paid to you outside the united states that are treated as i
dividends to which the 30 or lower treaty rate withholding tax discussed above
applies ii capital gains dividends or iii distributions attributable to
gain from the sale or exchange by us of united states real property interests
payment of the proceeds of a sale of stock within the united states or conducted
through certain us related financial intermediaries is subject to both backup
withholding and information reporting unless the beneficial owner certifies
under penalty of perjury that he or she is not a us person and the payor does
not have actual knowledge that the beneficial owner is a us person or
otherwise established an exemption you may obtain a refund of any amounts
withheld under the backup withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for
refund with the internal revenue service

recent legislation and potential legislation or other actions affecting tax
consequences

president bush has proposed that dividends received by individuals from
corporations be excluded from income tax to the extent the corporation paid
federal income tax this exclusion would generally not apply to reits the
proposal would permit most corporations to retain aftertax proceeds with its
stockholders receiving a basis increase in their shares as if a dividend had
been


                                      16

distributed and reinvested the national association of real estate investment
trusts the industry trade organization believes that to the extent a reit pays
corporate taxes either through a taxable reit subsidiary or by retaining 10 of
its taxable income a reits stockholders will receive a basis increase

current and prospective stockholders should recognize that the present federal
income tax treatment of an investment in us may be modified by legislative
judicial or administrative action at any time and that any action may affect
investments and commitments previously made the rules dealing with federal
income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the
legislative process and by the internal revenue service and the treasury
department resulting in revisions of regulations and revised interpretations of
established concepts as well as statutory changes revisions in federal tax laws
and interpretations of these laws could adversely affect the tax consequences of
an investment in us

item 3 legal proceedings

on november 20 2002 doctors community health care corporation and five
subsidiaries filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the united states
bankruptcy court for the district of columbia doctors has stated that the
bankruptcy filing was due to the bankruptcy of national century financial
enterprises and affiliates who halted payments to health care providers
including doctors we have provided mortgage financing to doctors in the form of
a loan secured by pacifica hospital of the valley in sun valley ca a property
that is owned by one of the debtor subsidiaries the outstanding principal
balance of the loan is approximately 188 million at december 31 2002 based
upon an appraisal and historical performance of pacifica hospital we expect to
receive payment in full of the outstanding principal and accrued interest which
we believe we are entitled to as an oversecured creditor we do not currently
intend to recognize any interest on the loan if payment is not received

alterra healthcare corporation filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on
january 23 2003 in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of
delaware we have a master lease with alterra for 45 assisted living facilities
with a depreciated book value of 106 million at december 31 2002 we expect
alterra to remain current on rent payments and to assume the master lease at
current rental levels

from time to time there are other various legal proceedings pending to which we
are a party or to which some of our properties are subject arising in the normal
course of business we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these
proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
position or results of operations

we generated increased rental income as a result of the acquisition of
properties for which we receive rent this was partially offset by a reduction
in interest income due to the repayment of mortgage loans commitment fees and
other income decreased primarily as a result of the completion of construction
projects

during 2001 we received payoffs on mortgages that had significant prepayment
fee requirements generating 990000 in that year during 2002 we did not
receive any prepayment fees with respect to mortgage loan payoffs

expenses were comprised of the following

the increase in interest expense from 2001 to 2002 was primarily due to higher
average borrowings during the year and a reduction in the amount of capitalized
interest offsetting interest expense

we capitalize certain interest costs associated with funds used to finance the
construction of properties owned directly by us the amount capitalized is based
upon the borrowings outstanding during the construction period using the rate of
interest that approximates our cost of

capitalized interest for the year ended december 31 2002 totaled 170000 as
compared with 841000 for the same period in 2001

the provision for depreciation increased primarily as a result of additional
investments in properties owned directly by us

general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues including
revenues from discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2002
were 583 as compared with 603 for the same period in 2001

the increase in loan expense was primarily due to the additional amortization of
costs related to the unsecured line of credit renewal and the unsecured senior
notes issued in 2001 and 2002

during the year ended december 31 2002 it was determined that the projected
undiscounted cash flows from a parcel of land one assisted living facility and
one specialty care facility did not exceed their related net book values and
impairment charges of 2298000 were recorded to reduce the properties to their
estimated fair market values the estimated fair market values of the properties
were determined by offers to purchase received from third parties or estimated
net sales proceeds

the properties sold during 2002 to discontinued operations these properties
generated 1708000 and 2580000 of income after deducting depreciation and
interest expense from rental revenue for the years ended december 31 2002 and
2001 respectively

in april 2002 we purchased 35000000 of our outstanding unsecured senior
notes that were due in 2003 and recorded a charge of 403000 in connection with
this early extinguishment in september 2001 we purchased 7750000 of our
outstanding unsecured senior notes that were due in 2002 and recorded a charge
of 213000 in connection with this early extinguishment

as a result of the various factors mentioned above net income available to
common stockholders was 55191000 or 148 per diluted share for 2002 as

we generated increased rental income as a result of the completion of real
property construction projects for which we began receiving rent and the
purchase of properties previously financed by us this offset a reduction in
interest income due to the repayment of mortgage loans and the purchase of
properties previously financed by us

the reduction in commitment fees and other income is due primarily to the
significant reduction in construction activity

during the years ended december 31 2001 and 2000 we sold properties with
carrying values of 23829000 and 107182000 respectively for a net loss of
1250000 in 2001 and a net gain of 1684000 in 2000 in august 2001 the
financial accounting standards board issued statement no 144 accounting for
the impairment or disposal of longlived assets which is effective for fiscal
years beginning after december 15 2001 we adopted the standard effective
january 1 2002 in accordance with statement no 144 we have reclassified the
income and expenses attributable to the properties sold during 2002 to
discontinued operations these properties generated 2580000 and 2500000 of
income after deducting depreciation and interest expense from rental revenue for
the years ended december 31 2001 and 2000 respectively

in september 2001 we purchased 7750000 of our outstanding unsecured senior
notes that were due in 2002 and recorded a charge of 213000 in connection with
this early extinguishment

as a result of the various factors mentioned above net income available to
common stockholders was 47044000 or 152 per diluted share for 2001 as
compared with 54566000 or 191 per diluted share for 2000

critical accounting policies

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the united states which require us to make
estimates and assumptions see note 1 to our audited consolidated financial
statements we believe that of our significant accounting policies the
following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and
estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements

revenue recognition

revenue is recorded in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 101
revenue recognition in financial statements sab 101 as amended sab 101
requires that revenue be recognized after four basic criteria are met these
four criteria include persuasive evidence of an arrangement the rendering of
service fixed and determinable income and reasonably assured collectibility if
the collectibility of revenue is determined incorrectly the amount and timing
of our reported revenue could be significantly affected interest income on
loans is recognized as earned based upon the principal amount outstanding
operating lease income includes base rent payments plus fixed annual rent
increases which are recognized on a straightline basis over the minimum lease
period this lease income is greater than the amount of cash received during the
first half of the lease term

impairment of longlived assets

the net book value of longlived assets is reviewed quarterly on a property by
property basis to determine if there are indicators of impairment these
indicators may include anticipated operating losses at the property level the
tenants inability to make rent payments a decision to dispose of an asset
before the end of its estimated useful life and changes in the market that may
permanently reduce the value of the property if indicators of impairment exist
then the undiscounted future cash flows from the most likely use of the property
are compared to the current net book value if the undiscounted cash flows are
less than the net book value an impairment loss would be recognized to the
extent that the net book value exceeds the current fair market value this
analysis requires us to determine if indicators of impairment exist and to
estimate the most likely stream of cash flows to be generated from the property
during the period the property is expected to be held if the projections or
assumptions change in the future we may be required to record an impairment
charge and reduce the net book value of the property owned

allowance for loan losses

the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate to
absorb potential losses in our loans receivable the determination of the
allowance is based on a quarterly evaluation of these loans including general
economic conditions and estimated collectibility of loan payments we regularly
evaluate the collectibility of our loans receivable based on a combination of
factors these factors include delinquency status as determined by frequency of
payments historical loan chargeoffs financial strength of the borrower and
guarantors and value of the underlying property if these factors indicate that
there is greater risk of loan chargeoffs additional allowances or placement on
nonaccrual status may be required

depreciation and useful lives

we compute depreciation on our properties using the straightline method based
on their estimated useful lives which range from fifteen to forty years for
buildings and five to twelve years for improvements a significant portion of
the acquisition cost of each property is allocated to the building usually
approximately 90 the allocation of the acquisition cost to building and the
determination of the useful life of a property are based on appraisals
commissioned from independent real estate appraisal firms if we do not allocate
appropriately to the building or if we incorrectly estimate the useful life of
our properties the computation of depreciation will not appropriately reflect
the allocation of our capital expenditures over future periods

impact of inflation

during the past three years inflation has not significantly affected our
earnings because of the moderate inflation rate additionally our earnings are
primarily longterm investments with fixed interest rates these investments are
mainly financed with a combination of equity senior notes and borrowings under
our revolving lines of credit during inflationary periods that generally are
accompanied by rising interest rates our ability to grow may be adversely
affected because the yield on new investments may increase at a slower rate than
new borrowing costs presuming the current inflation rate remains moderate and
longterm interest rates do not increase significantly we believe that
inflation will not impact the availability of equity and debt financing

forwardlooking statements and risk factors

we have made and incorporated by reference statements in this form 10k that
constitute forwardlooking statements as that term is defined in the federal
securities laws these forwardlooking statements concern

o    the possible expansion of our portfolio

o    the performance of our operators and properties

o    our ability to obtain new viable tenants for properties which we take back
     from financially troubled tenants if any

o    our ability to make distributions

o    our policies and plans regarding investments financings and other matters

o    our tax status as a real estate investment trust


                                      26
page


o    our ability to appropriately balance the use of debt and equity and

o    our ability to access capital markets or other sources of funds

when we use words such as believe expect anticipate estimate or
similar expressions we are making forwardlooking statements forwardlooking
statements are not guaranties of future performance and involve risks and
uncertainties our expected results may not be achieved and actual results may
differ materially from our expectations this may be a result of various
factors including but not limited to

o    the status of the economy

o    the status of capital markets including prevailing interest rates

o    changes in financing terms and

o    the risks described below

risk factors related to our operators revenues and expenses

our skilled nursing and specialty care facility operators revenues are
primarily driven by occupancy and medicaid medicare and private pay rates our
assisted living facility operators revenues are primarily driven by occupancy
and private pay rates expenses for these three types of facilities are
primarily driven by the costs of labor food utilities taxes insurance and
rent or debt service revenues from government reimbursement have and are
likely to continue to come under pressure due to medicare cuts and state budget
shortfalls liability insurance and staffing costs continue to increase for our
operators to the extent that any decrease in revenues andor any increase in
operating expenses result in a facility not generating enough cash to make
payments to us the credit of our operator and the value of other collateral
would have to be relied upon

risk factors related to operator bankruptcies

we are exposed to the risk that our operators may not be able to meet the rent
principal and interest or other payments due us which may result in an operator
bankruptcy or insolvency or that an operator might become subject to bankruptcy
or insolvency proceedings for other reasons although our operating lease
agreements provide us the right to evict an operator demand immediate payment
of rent and exercise other remedies and our mortgage loans provide us the right
to terminate any funding obligation demand immediate repayment of principal and
unpaid interest foreclose on the collateral and exercise other remedies the
bankruptcy laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy
or reorganization an operator in bankruptcy may be able to limit or delay our
ability to collect unpaid rent in the case of a lease or to receive unpaid
principal and interest in the case of a mortgage loan and to exercise other
rights and remedies

the receipt of liquidation proceeds or the replacement of an operator that has
defaulted on its lease or loan could be delayed by the approval process of any
federal state or local agency necessary for the transfer of the facility or the
replacement of the operator licensed to manage the facility in addition we may
be required to fund certain expenses eg real estate taxes and maintenance
to preserve the value of a facility avoid the imposition of liens on a facility
andor to transition a facility to a new operator in some instances we have
terminated our lease with an operator and relet the facility to another
operator in some of those situations we provided working capital loans to and
limited indemnification of the new operator if we cannot transition a leased
facility to a new operator we may take possession of that facility which may
expose us to certain successor liabilities should these events occur our
revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely affected

on november 20 2002 doctors community health care corporation and five
subsidiaries filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection doctors has stated that
the bankruptcy filing was due to the bankruptcy of national century financial
enterprises and affiliates who halted payments to health care providers
including doctors we have provided mortgage financing to doctors in the form of
a loan secured by pacifica hospital of the valley in sun valley ca a property
that is owned by one of the debtor subsidiaries the outstanding principal
balance of the loan is approximately 188 million at december 31 2002 based
upon an appraisal and historical performance of pacifica hospital we expect to
receive payment in full of the outstanding principal and accrued interest which
we believe we are entitled to as an oversecured creditor we do not currently
intend to recognize any interest on the loan if payment is not received

alterra healthcare corporation filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on
january 23 2003 we have a master lease with alterra for 45 assisted living
facilities with a depreciated book value of 106 million at december 31 2002
we expect alterra to remain current on rent payments and to assume the master
lease at current rental levels

risk factors related to government regulations

our operators businesses are affected by government and private payor
reimbursement rates to the extent that any skilled nursing or specialty care
facility receives a significant portion of its revenues from governmental
payors primarily medicaid and medicare these revenues may be subject to
statutory and regulatory changes retroactive rate adjustments recovery of
program overpayments or setoffs administrative rulings policy
interpretations payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries government
funding restrictions at a program level or with respect to specific facilities
and interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing governmental
investigations and audits at the facility in recent years governmental payors
have frozen or reduced payments to health care providers due to budgetary
pressures this trend in health care reimbursement will likely continue to be of
paramount importance to federal and state authorities we cannot make any
assessment as to the ultimate timing or effect any future legislative reforms
may have on the financial condition of the skilled nursing industry the
specialty care industry or on the health care industry in general there can be
no


                                      27
page


assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will continue to be available for
services provided by any facility operator whether the facility receives
reimbursement from medicare medicaid or private payors significant limits on
the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have
a material adverse effect on an operators liquidity financial condition and
results of operations which could adversely affect the ability of an operator
to meet its obligations to us see item 1  business  certain government
regulations  reimbursement above

risk factors related to liability claims and insurance costs

longterm care facility operators assisted living and skilled nursing
facilities have experienced substantial increases in both the number and size
of patient care liability claims in recent years particularly in the states of
texas and florida as a result general and professional liability costs have
increased and may continue to increase nationwide longterm care liability
insurance rates are increasing because of large jury awards in states like texas
and florida over the past two years both texas and florida have adopted
skilled nursing facility liability laws that modify or limit statutes in the
nature of tort reform despite some of these reforms the longterm care
industry overall continues to experience very high general and professional
liability costs insurance markets have responded to this claim crisis by
severely restricting their capacity to write longterm care general and
professional liability policies no assurances can be given that the climate for
longterm care general and professional liability insurance will improve in
texas florida or any other states where our facility operators conduct
business insurance companies may continue to reduce or stop writing general and
professional liability policies for skilled nursing and assisted living
facilities thus general and professional liability insurance coverage may be
restricted or very costly which may adversely affect the facility operators
future operations cash flows and financial condition and may have a material
adverse effect on the facility operators ability to meet their obligations to
us

risk factors related to our structure

we are also subject to a number of risks on the corporate level first we might
fail to qualify or remain qualified as a real estate investment trust reit
we intend to operate as a reit under the internal revenue code and believe we
have and will continue to operate as a reit since reit qualification requires
us to meet a number of complex requirements it is possible that we may fail to
fulfill them and if we do our earnings will be reduced by the amount of
federal taxes owed a reduction in our earnings would affect the amount we could
distribute to our stockholders also if we were not a reit we would not be
required to make distributions to stockholders since a nonreit is not required
to pay dividends to stockholders amounting to at least 90 of its annual taxable
income see item 1  business  taxation for a discussion of the provisions of
the internal revenue code that apply to us and the effects of nonqualification

second the antitakeover provisions in our second restated certificate of
incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could
make it more difficult for or even prevent a third party from acquiring us
without the approval of our incumbent board of directors we have adopted a
poison pill rights plan that has antitakeover effects the rights plan if
triggered will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to
acquire us on terms not approved by the board of directors provisions and
agreements that inhibit or discourage takeover attempts could reduce the market
value of our common stock

third we are dependent on key personnel although we have entered into
employment agreements with our executive officers losing any one of them could
at least temporarily have an adverse impact on our operations we believe that
losing more than one of our executive officers would have a material adverse
impact on our business

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

we are exposed to various market risks including the potential loss arising
from adverse changes in interest rates we seek to mitigate the effects of
fluctuations in interest rates by matching the terms of new investments with new
longterm fixed rate borrowings to the extent possible the following section is
presented to provide a discussion of the risks associated with potential
fluctuations in interest rates

we historically borrow on our revolving lines of credit to make acquisitions of
loans to or to construct health care facilities then as market conditions
dictate we will issue equity or longterm fixed rate debt to repay the
borrowings under the revolving lines of credit

a change in interest rates will not affect the interest expense associated with
our fixed rate debt interest rate changes however will affect the fair value
of our fixed rate debt a 1 increase in interest rates would result in a
decrease in fair value of our senior unsecured notes by approximately 15
million at december 31 2002 16 million at december 31 2001 changes in the
interest rate environment upon maturity of this fixed rate debt could have an
effect on our future cash flows and earnings depending on whether the debt is
replaced with other fixed rate debt with variable rate debt with equity or by
the sale of assets

our variable rate debt including our unsecured and secured revolving credit
arrangements is reflected at fair value at december 31 2002 a 1 increase in
interest rates related to this variable rate debt assuming no changes in
outstanding balances would result in increased annual interest expense of
1135000 500000 at december 31 2001

we are subject to risks associated with debt financing including the risk that
existing indebtedness may not be refinanced or that the terms of refinancing may
not be as favorable as the terms of current indebtedness the majority of our
borrowings were completed under indentures or contractual agreements that limit
the amount of indebtedness we may incur accordingly in the event that we are
unable to raise additional equity or borrow money because of these limitations
our ability to acquire additional properties may be limited

we may or may not elect to use financial derivative instruments to hedge
variable interest rate exposure these decisions are principally based on our
policy to match our variable rate investments with comparable borrowings but
are also based on the general trend in interest rates at the applicable dates
and our perception of the future volatility of interest rates
