the administrative segment includes the administrative expenses of the company’s corporate headquarters site also included in the administrative segment is interest expense interest and investment income certain expenses related to closed facilities and environmentalrelated matters and other expenses which are not directly associated with the reportable segments the administrative segment does not include any significant foreign operations also included in the administrative segment is the operations of a real estate management unit that is responsible for the ownership management and leasing of nonretail properties held primarily for use by the company including the company’s headquarters site and disposal of idle facilities sales of this segment represent external leasing revenue of excess headquarters space or leasing of facilities no longer used by the company in its primary businesses material gains and losses from the sale of property are infrequent and not a significant operating factor in determining the performance of the administrative segment 

raw materials and products purchased for resale 

raw materials and products purchased for resale make up the majority of our consolidated cost of goods sold raw materials may vary considerably by the specific paint or coating being manufactured but can generally be divided into the following categories resins and latex pigments additives solvents and metal or plastic containers a significant portion of these raw materials are derived from various upstream petrochemical and related commodity feedstocks notably propylene raw materials are sourced from multiple suppliers globally typically within the geographic region where our products are being manufactured a small portion of specialized resins and other products are manufactured in house we also purchase a variety of products for resale that are highly complementary to our paint and coating offerings notably spray equipment and parts floorcovering and assorted sundries we attempt if feasible to mitigate our potential risk associated with the sourcing of our raw materials and other products through inventory management strategic relationships with key suppliers alternative sourcing strategies and longterm investments to expand our manufacturing capabilities see item 1a risk factors for more information regarding cost and sourcing of raw materials 

seasonality 

the majority of the sales for the reportable segments traditionally occur during the second and third quarters however periods of economic downturn can alter these seasonal patterns there is no significant seasonality in sales for the administrative segment 

working capital 

in order to meet increased demand during the second and third quarters the company usually builds its inventories during the first quarter working capital items inventories and accounts receivable are generally financed through shortterm borrowings which include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of commercial paper for a description of the company’s liquidity and capital resources see the “financial condition liquidity and cash flow” section in item 7 

trademarks and trade names 

customer recognition of trademarks and trade names owned or licensed by the company collectively contribute significantly to our sales the major trademarks and trade names used by each of the reportable segments are set forth below

backlog and productive capacity 

backlog orders are not typically significant in the business of any reportable segment since there is normally a short period of time between the placing of an order and shipment during 2021 we experienced raw material shortages labor constraints and weatherrelated shutdowns that impacted our production and ability to meet customer orders we believe that sufficient productive capacity currently exists to fulfill our needs for paint coatings and related products during 2022

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks described below and in other documents we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition although the risks are organized by headings and each risk is discussed separately many are interrelated readers should not interpret the disclosure of any risk factor to imply that the risk has not already materialized 

economic and strategic risks 

the covid19 pandemic has adversely impacted our business results of operations cash flow and financial condition and the continuing effects of the covid19 pandemic remain highly unpredictable and could adversely impact our business results of operations cash flow liquidity and financial condition in the future 

our business results of operations cash flow and financial condition have been and may be in the future adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic including the impacts resulting from efforts by public health and governmental authorities to contain and combat the outbreak and spread of covid19 since the onset of the pandemic we have made changes in our business designed to support these efforts and protect the health and wellbeing of our employees and customers the changes in our business have included temporarily reducing store hours and closing our sales floors in our companyoperated paint stores to the general public requiring our customers to order product online or via phone and to access their products via curbside pickup or delivery implementing remote alternate and flexible work arrangements where possible enhancing cleaning and sanitation procedures implementing domestic and international travel restrictions and return to work and visitor screening protocols postponing or canceling the hosting or attending of large events and enhancing certain employee benefits such as telehealth paid sick leave family leave and voluntary leave of absence policies and programs we continue to evaluate the changes we have made in our business consider new and further changes and work with public health government and other authorities and organizations to maintain our operations and support the health and wellbeing of our employees customers and their families 

the necessary and appropriate measures we have taken have resulted in additional costs including for covidrelated leave and healthcare costs and have adversely impacted our business and financial performance as the pandemic continues and evolves we may incur additional costs and experience further adverse impacts to our business each of which may be significant we also have faced and may continue to face operational risks in connection with remote and hybrid inoffice work arrangements including but not limited to cybersecurity risks and increased vulnerability to damage or interruption resulting from among other causes cyber attacks security breaches phishing malware viruses ransomware power outages or system failures 

the covid19 pandemic has severely impacted the global economy disrupted consumer spending and global supply chains and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets all of which may continue and all of which have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our business we have experienced occasional temporary disruptions and closures of some of our facilities including more recently in connection with the omicron variant and due to our employees or their family members testing positive for covid19 we also have seen shifts in consumer behaviors and preferences as well as impacts in the demand for some of our products while demand levels for our products have been returning to more normalized levels our ability to predict and meet any future changes in the demand for our products due to the impacts of the pandemic remains uncertain 

while we continue to closely monitor the impact of the pandemic on all aspects of our business the extent of the impact on our results of operations cash flow liquidity and financial performance as well as our ability to execute nearterm and longterm business strategies and initiatives will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments which are highly uncertain and which we cannot predict or control and some of which we are not currently aware including but not limited to a the duration severity and scope of the pandemic including additional variants and waves of covid19 cases b rapidlychanging governmental and public health directives to contain and combat the outbreak including with respect to covid19 vaccination and testing requirements and the duration degree effectiveness and easing removal or reinstitution of directives c the further development availability effectiveness and distribution of covid19 treatments and vaccines d the extent and duration of the pandemic’s adverse andor volatile effects on economic and social activity supply chain logistics inflationary pressures consumer confidence discretionary spending and preferences labor and healthcare costs labor markets and unemployment rates any of which may reduce demand for some of our products impact our ability to predict and meet any future changes in the demand for our products or impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us e our ability to sell provide and meet the demand for our services and products including as a result of new or the reinstitution of prior directives f any temporary reduction in our workforce or closures of our offices and facilities and our ability to adequately staff and maintain our operations including as a result of employees or their family members testing positive for covid19 g the ability of our customers and suppliers to continue their operations which could affect our ability to sell provide and meet the demand for our services and products and result in terminations of contracts losses of 

revenue and adverse effects to our supply chain and h any impairment in value of our tangible or intangible assets which could be recorded as a result of weaker economic conditions if the pandemic continues to create disruptions or turmoil in the credit or financial markets or impacts our credit ratings in the future it could adversely affect our ability to access capital on favorable terms and continue to meet our liquidity needs 

given the inherent uncertainty surrounding covid19 the pandemic may continue to create challenging operating environments and may have an adverse impact on our business in the near term if these conditions persist or worsen for a prolonged period the covid19 pandemic including any of the above factors and others that are currently unknown may also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

adverse changes in general business and economic conditions in the united states and worldwide may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

our business is sensitive to global and regional business and economic conditions adverse changes in such conditions in the united states and worldwide including due to the covid19 pandemic may reduce the demand for some of our products adversely impact our ability to predict and meet any future changes in the demand for our products and impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us each of which could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition higher inflation rates interest rates tax rates and unemployment rates higher labor and healthcare costs recessions changing governmental policies laws and regulations business disruptions due to cybersecurity incidents terrorist activity armed conflict war public health crises including the covid19 pandemic impacts of climate change fires or other natural disasters supply chain disruptions and other economic factors could also adversely affect demand for some of our products our ability to predict and meet any future changes in the demand for our products the availability delivery or cost of raw materials our ability to adequately staff and maintain operations at affected facilities and our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition and that of our customers vendors and suppliers 

protracted duration of economic downturns in cyclical segments of the economy may depress the demand for some of our products and adversely affect our sales earnings cash flow or financial condition 

portions of our business involve the sale of paint coatings and related products to segments of the economy that are cyclical in nature particularly segments relating to construction housing manufacturing and oil production refining storage and transportation our sales to these segments are affected by the levels of discretionary consumer and business spending in these segments during economic downturns in these segments the levels of consumer and business discretionary spending may decrease and the recovery of these segments may lag behind the recovery of the overall economy this decrease in spending likely will reduce the demand for some of our products and may adversely affect our sales earnings cash flow or financial condition 

although interest rates remain low by historical standards any increase may adversely affect the demand for new residential homes existing home turnover and new nonresidential construction a worsening in these segments will reduce the demand for some of our products and may adversely impact sales earnings and cash flow 

in the us construction and housing segments the recent demand for new construction has caused contractors to experience a shortage of skilled workers resulting in related project backlogs and an adverse effect on the growth rate of demand for our products while we expect to see higher demand for our products as project backlogs are reduced in the future this labor shortage may adversely impact our sales earnings cash flow or financial condition 

financial risks 

a weakening of global credit markets could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

a weakening of global credit markets could adversely impact our net sales the collection of accounts receivable funding for working capital needs expected cash flow generation from current and acquired businesses access to capital and our investments which could adversely impact our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we finance a portion of our sales through trade credit credit markets remain tight and some customers who require financing for their businesses have not been able to obtain and may in the future have difficulty obtaining necessary financing a continuation or worsening of these conditions could limit our ability to collect our accounts receivable which could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we generally fund a portion of our seasonal working capital needs and obtain funding for other general corporate purposes through shortterm borrowings backed by our revolving credit facility and other financing facilities if any of the banks in these credit and financing facilities are unable to perform on their commitments such inability could adversely impact our cash flow liquidity or financial condition including our ability to obtain funding for working capital needs and other general corporate purposes 

although we have available credit facilities to fund our current operating needs we cannot be certain we will be able to replace our existing credit facilities or refinance our existing or future debt when necessary our cost of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by our debt and credit ratings assigned by the major credit rating agencies downgrades in these ratings including due to uncertainties regarding covid19 likely would increase our cost of borrowing and could have an adverse effect on our access to the capital markets including our access to the commercial paper market an inability to access the capital markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we have goodwill and intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet we periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such value may not be recoverable an impairment assessment involves judgment as to assumptions regarding future sales and cash flow and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions future events and changing market conditions may impact our assumptions and change our estimates of future sales and cash flow resulting in us incurring substantial impairment charges which would adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

we hold investments in equity and debt securities in some of our defined benefit pension plans a decrease in the value of plan assets resulting from a general financial downturn may cause a negative pension plan investment performance which may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we require a significant amount of cash to service the substantial amount of debt we have outstanding our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control we also depend on the business of our subsidiaries to satisfy our cash needs if we cannot generate the required cash we may not be able to make the necessary payments required under our indebtedness 

at december 31 2021 we had total debt of approximately 9615 billion which is an increase of 1323 billion since december 31 2020 we have the ability under our existing credit facilities to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future our ability to make payments on our debt fund our other liquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future our historical financial results have been and we anticipate our future financial results will be subject to fluctuations our ability to generate cash to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control including public health crises such as the covid19 pandemic adverse weather conditions or natural disasters such as due to the impacts of climate change supply chain disruptions and related impacts we cannot guarantee our business will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make payments of our debt fund other liquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures 

the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences for shareholders for example it could 

• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other longterm growth initiatives and general corporate purposes 

• increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions 

• limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future to enable us to react to changes in our business or economic or industry conditions or 

• place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to businesses in our industry that have less debt 

additionally any failure to comply with covenants in the instruments governing our debt could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived would have a material adverse effect on us 

a significant portion of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries as a result our ability to generate sufficient cash flow for our needs is dependent to some extent on the earnings of our subsidiaries and the payment of those earnings to us in the form of dividends loans or advances and through repayment of loans or advances from us our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay any amounts due on our debt or to provide us with funds to meet our cash flow needs whether in the form of dividends distributions loans or other payments further any payment of dividends loans or advances by our subsidiaries could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions payments to us by our subsidiaries will also be contingent upon our subsidiaries’ earnings and business considerations our right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary’s creditors including trade creditors even if we are a creditor of any of our subsidiaries our rights as a creditor would be subordinate to any security interest in the assets of our subsidiaries and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries senior to that held by us finally changes in the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may adversely affect the ability of some of our foreign subsidiaries to repatriate funds to us 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

because of our international operations we are exposed to risk associated with interest rates and value changes in foreign currencies which may adversely affect our business historically our reported net sales earnings cash flow and financial condition have been subjected to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates our primary exchange rate exposure is with the euro the chinese yuan the canadian dollar the brazilian real the british pound and the mexican peso each against the us dollar while we actively manage the exposure of our foreign currency risk as part of our overall financial risk management policy we believe we may experience losses from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and such losses could adversely affect our sales earnings cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

operational risks 

adverse weather conditions and natural disasters including due to the impacts of climate change may temporarily reduce the demand for some of our products impact our ability to meet the demand for our products or cause supply chain disruptions and increased costs and could have a negative effect on our sales earnings or cash flow 

our business is seasonal in nature with the second and third quarters typically generating a higher proportion of sales and earnings than other quarters from time to time adverse weather conditions and natural disasters including due to the impacts of climate change have had or may have an adverse effect on our sales manufacture and distribution of paint coatings and related products in the event adverse weather conditions or a natural disaster cause significant damage to any one or more of our principal manufacturing or distribution facilities we may not be able to manufacture the products needed to meet customer demand which could have an adverse effect on our sales of certain paint coatings and related products 

the impact of these risks to our suppliers also have had or may have an adverse effect on our sales manufacture and distribution of certain of our products during 2021 winter storm uri and hurricane ida caused significant damage to certain of our suppliers’ facilities in texas and louisiana respectively these natural disasters and their impacts to certain of our suppliers resulted in unprecedented industrywide supply chain disruptions increased raw material and other costs and significantly hindered our ability to manufacture the products needed to fully meet customer demand we discuss these natural disasters and their adverse impact to our business in more detail in the “outlook” section in item 7 

in any of these instances an adverse effect on sales may cause a reduction in our earnings or cash flow 

unexpected shortages and increases in the cost of raw materials and energy may adversely affect our earnings or cash flow 

we purchase raw materials including titanium dioxide and petrochemical feedstock sources such as propylene and ethylene and energy for use in the manufacturing distribution and sale of our products factors such as political instability higher tariffs supply chain disruptions adverse weather conditions and natural disasters including hurricanes and severe winter or other storms due to the impacts of climate change or public health crises including the covid19 pandemic could disrupt the availability of raw material and fuel supplies adversely impact our ability to meet customer demands for some of our products or adequately staff and maintain operations at affected facilities and increase our costs in addition environmental and social regulations including regulations related to climate change may negatively impact us or our suppliers in terms of availability and cost of raw materials as well as sources and supply of energy although raw materials and energy supplies including oil and natural gas are generally available from various sources in sufficient quantities unexpected shortages and increases in the cost of raw materials and energy or any deterioration in our relationships with or the financial viability of our suppliers may have an adverse effect on our earnings or cash flow in the event we experience supply chain disruptions from our suppliers we may not be able to timely secure alternate sources in order to prevent significant impacts to our business or we may experience quality issues with raw materials and energy sourced from alternate sources if the cost of raw materials and energy increases we may not be able to offset higher costs in a timely manner by sufficiently decreasing our operating costs or raising the prices of our products in recent years some raw material and energy prices have increased particularly titanium dioxide and petrochemical feedstock sources such as propylene and ethylene as well as metal and plastic packaging 

the cost of raw materials and energy could continue to experience periods of volatility in the future and may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow 

although we have an extensive customer base the loss of any of our largest customers could adversely affect our sales earnings or cash flow 

we have a large and varied customer base due to our extensive distribution platform during 2021 no individual customer accounted for sales totaling more than ten percent of our sales however we have some customers that individually purchase a large amount of products from us although our broad distribution channels help to minimize the impact of the loss of any one customer the loss of any of these large customers could have an adverse effect on our sales earnings or cash flow 

increased competition or failure to keep pace with developments in key competitive areas of our business may reduce our sales earnings or cash flow performance 

we face substantial competition from many international national regional and local competitors of various sizes in the manufacture distribution and sale of our paint coatings and related products some of our competitors operate more extensively in certain regions around the world and have greater financial or operational resources to compete internationally other competitors are smaller and may be able to offer more specialized products technology product quality product innovation breadth of product line technical expertise distribution service and price are key competitive factors for our business competition in any of these areas or failure to keep pace with developments in any of these areas may reduce our sales and adversely affect our earnings or cash flow by resulting in decreased sales volumes reduced prices and increased costs of manufacturing distributing and selling our products 

our results of operations cash flow or financial condition may be negatively impacted if we do not successfully integrate future acquisitions into our existing operations and if the performance of the businesses we acquire do not meet our expectations 

we have historically made strategic acquisitions of businesses in the paint and coatings industry and likely will acquire additional businesses in the future as part of our longterm growth strategy the success of future acquisitions depends in large part on our ability to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired companies and manage challenges that may arise as a result of the acquisitions particularly when the acquired businesses operate in new or foreign markets in the event we do not successfully integrate such future acquisitions into our existing operations so as to realize the expected return on our investment our results of operations cash flow or financial condition could be adversely affected 

risks and uncertainties associated with our expansion into and our operations in asia europe south america and other foreign markets could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

net external sales of our consolidated foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately 212 195 and 206 of our total consolidated net sales in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively sales outside of the united states make up a significant part of our current business and future strategic plans our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition could be adversely affected by a variety of domestic and international factors including general economic conditions political instability inflation rates recessions tariffs foreign currency exchange rates foreign currency exchange controls interest rates foreign investment and repatriation restrictions legal and regulatory constraints civil unrest difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and other external economic and political factors in addition public health crises including the covid19 pandemic in foreign jurisdictions may temporarily reduce the demand for some of our products and adversely affect the availability and cost of raw materials our inability to successfully manage the risks and uncertainties relating to any of these factors could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

in many foreign countries it is not uncommon to engage in certain business practices we are prohibited from engaging in because of regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act recent years have seen a substantial increase in antibribery law enforcement activity with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both us and nonus regulators and an increase in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals although we have internal control policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these regulations there can be no assurance our policies and procedures will prevent a violation of these regulations any violation could cause an adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

policy changes affecting international trade could adversely impact the demand for our products and our competitive position 

due to the international scope of our operations changes in government policies on foreign trade and investment may affect the demand for our products and services impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries our business benefits from free trade agreements which may include the united statesmexicocanada agreement and efforts to withdraw from or substantially modify such agreements in addition to the implementation of more restrictive trade policies such as more detailed inspections higher tariffs import or export licensing requirements exchange controls or new barriers to entry could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or cash flow and that of our customers vendors and suppliers 

additionally the results of the united kingdom’s referendum on european union membership which resulted in the united kingdom’s exit from the european union on january 31 2020 “brexit” caused significant volatility in global stock markets currency exchange rate fluctuations and global economic uncertainty the transition period postbrexit expired on december 31 2020 and the united kingdom and european union entered into a free trade agreement that now governs the united kingdom’s relationship with the european union while the united kingdom and european union generally have continued to trade with each other without the imposition of tariffs for imports and exports trades have been subject to new customs 

requirements that require additional documentation and data and new controls on the movement and reporting of goods including chemicals although we have not experienced any material disruption in our business as a result of brexit to date we do not know the extent to which brexit and the free trade agreement will ultimately impact the business and regulatory environment in the united kingdom the rest of the european union or other countries although it is possible there will be tighter controls and administrative requirements for imports and exports between the united kingdom and the european union or other countries as well as increased regulatory complexities as the transition continues any of these factors could adversely impact customer demand our relationships with customers and suppliers and our results of operations 

cybersecurity incidents and other disruptions to our information technology systems could interfere with our operations result in the compromise or loss of critical and confidential information and severely harm our business 

we rely on information technology systems to conduct our business including recording and processing transactions manufacturing and selling our products researching and developing new products maintaining and growing our competitive position and supporting and communicating with our employees customers suppliers and other vendors these information technology systems are important to many businesscritical processes including but not limited to production planning manufacturing finance company operations sales and customer service some of these systems are maintained or operated by thirdparty providers despite our efforts to prevent disruptions to these information technology systems these systems may be affected by damage or interruption resulting from among other causes cyber attacks security breaches phishing malware viruses ransomware power outages or system failures these risks could be magnified due to the increased reliance on information technology systems to conduct our business including those used in furtherance of remote and hybrid inoffice work environments disruptions to these systems may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

as part of our business we collect and handle sensitive and confidential information about our business customers employees and suppliers despite the security measures we have in place our facilities and systems and those third parties with which we do business may be vulnerable to cyber attacks security breaches malware viruses ransomware power outages system failures acts of vandalism or misconduct human or technical errors or other similar events or disruptions any such event involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of information whether impacting us or third parties with which we do business could result in losses damage our reputation or relationships with customers and suppliers expose us to the risks of litigation regulatory action and liability disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we continue to mitigate these risks in a number of ways including through additional investment engagement of thirdparty experts and consultants improving the security of our facilities and systems providing annual training for all employees with more enhanced or frequent training based on role assessing the continued appropriateness of relevant insurance coverage and strengthening our controls to monitor and mitigate these threats 

the domestic and international regulatory environment related to information security collection and privacy is increasingly rigorous and complex with new and rapidly changing requirements applicable to our business compliance with these requirements including the european union’s general data protection regulation the california consumer privacy act and other international and domestic regulations could result in additional costs and changes to our business practices 

our ability to attract retain develop and progress a qualified workforce could adversely impact our business and impair our ability to meet our strategic objectives and the needs of our customers 

our continued success depends in part on our ability to identify attract and onboard qualified candidates with the requisite education background skills and experience and our ability to retain develop progress and engage qualified employees across our business including our stores fleet manufacturing corporate and other operations and functions competition for talent is intense and we are facing increased wage rates and labor shortages due to a tightened labor market and other macroeconomic conditions that have been exacerbated by the covid19 pandemic to the extent we are unable to remain competitive with our compensation and benefits talent management strategy inclusive workplace culture and related initiatives programs and practices or if qualified candidates or employees become more difficult to attract or retain under reasonable terms we may experience higher laborrelated costs and may be unable to attract retain develop and progress a qualified workforce which could adversely affect our business and future success and impair our ability to meet our strategic objectives and the needs of our customers 

inability to protect or enforce our material trademarks and other intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our business 

we have numerous patents trade secrets trademarks trade names and knowhow that are valuable to our business despite our efforts to protect such intellectual property and other proprietary information from unauthorized use or disclosure third parties may attempt to disclose obtain or use our trademarks or such other intellectual property and information without our authorization although we rely on the patent trademark trade secret and copyright laws of the united states and other countries to protect our intellectual property rights the laws of some countries may not protect such rights to the same extent as 

the laws of the united states unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties the failure of foreign countries to have laws to protect our intellectual property rights or an inability to effectively enforce such rights in foreign countries could have an adverse effect on our business 

legal and regulatory risks 

we are subject to a wide variety of complex domestic and foreign laws rules and regulations for which compliance could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

we are subject to a wide variety of complex domestic and foreign laws rules and regulations and legal compliance risks including securities laws tax laws employment and pensionrelated laws competition laws us and foreign export and trading laws data privacy and security laws and laws governing improper business practices we are affected by new laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations including interpretations by courts and regulators from time to time our company our operations and the industries in which we operate may be reviewed or investigated by regulators which could lead to enforcement actions or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages 

although we believe we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to mitigate these risks the global and diverse nature of our operations means compliance risks will continue to exist investigations examinations and other proceedings the nature and outcome of which cannot be predicted likely will arise from time to time these investigations examinations and other proceedings could subject us to significant liability and require us to take significant accruals or pay significant settlements fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

we are subject to tax laws and regulations in the united states and multiple foreign jurisdictions we are affected by changes in tax laws and regulations as well as changes in related interpretations and other tax guidance in the ordinary course of our business we are subject to examinations and investigations by various tax authorities and other regulators in addition to existing examinations and investigations there could be additional examinations and investigations in the future and existing examinations and investigations could be expanded 

for nonincome tax risks we estimate material loss contingencies and accrue for such loss contingencies as required by us generally accepted accounting principles based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency in the event the loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently accrued the recording of the additional liability may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such additional liability is accrued in those cases where no accrual is recorded because it is not probable a liability has been incurred and cannot be reasonably estimated any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued or paid for income tax risks we recognize tax benefits based on our assessment that a tax benefit has a greater than 50 likelihood of being sustained upon ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant facts for those income tax positions where we determine there is not a greater than 50 likelihood such tax benefits will be sustained we do not recognize a tax benefit in our financial statements subsequent events may cause us to change our assessment of the likelihood of sustaining a previouslyrecognized benefit which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial position for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued or paid 

we discuss risks and uncertainties with regard to taxes in more detail in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

we are required to comply with and may become subject to additional numerous complex and increasingly stringent domestic and foreign health safety and environmental including related to climate change laws regulations and requirements the cost of which is likely to increase and may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

our operations are subject to various domestic and foreign health safety and environmental laws regulations and requirements including those related to chemicals climate change and the covid19 pandemic these laws regulations and requirements not only govern our current operations and products but also impose potential liability on us for our past operations 

increased global focus on climate change may result in the imposition of new or additional regulations or requirements applicable to and increased financial risks for our business and industry a number of government authorities and agencies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes to address climate change including the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions the outcome of new legislation or regulation in the us and other jurisdictions in which we operate may result in new or additional requirements including to fund energy efficiency activities or renewable energy use and fees or restrictions 

on certain activities or materials compliance with these climate change initiatives may also result in additional costs to us including among other things increased production costs additional taxes additional investments in renewable energy use and other initiatives reduced emission allowances or additional restrictions on production or operations we may not be able to timely recover the cost of compliance with such new or more stringent laws and regulations which could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

we expect health safety and additional environmental laws regulations and requirements to be increasingly stringent upon our industry and us in the future our costs to comply with these laws regulations and requirements may increase as they become more stringent in the future and these increased costs may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

we are involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of our currently and formerlyowned sites as well as a number of thirdparty sites for which our ultimate liability may exceed the current amount we have accrued 

we are involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of our currently and formerlyowned sites and a number of thirdparty sites we accrue for estimated costs of investigation and remediation activities at these sites for which commitments or cleanup plans have been developed and when such costs can be reasonably estimated based on industry standards and professional judgment these estimated costs are based on currently available facts regarding each site we continuously assess our potential liability for investigation and remediation activities and adjust our environmentalrelated accruals as information becomes available upon which more accurate costs can be reasonably estimated due to the uncertainties surrounding environmental investigation and remediation activities our liability may result in costs that are significantly higher than currently accrued and may have an adverse effect on our earnings we discuss these risks and uncertainties in more detail in the “environmentalrelated liabilities” and “environmental matters” sections in item 7 and in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

the nature cost quantity and outcome of pending and future litigation such as litigation arising from the historical manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paint could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity and financial condition 

in the course of our business we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits including but not limited to litigation relating to product liability and warranty personal injury environmental including natural resource damages intellectual property commercial contractual and antitrust claims that are inherently subject to many uncertainties regarding the possibility of a loss to us these uncertainties will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur confirming the incurrence of a liability or the reduction of a liability in accordance with the contingencies topic of the asc we accrue for these contingencies by a charge to income when it is both probable that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact of a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated in the event a loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently accrued the recording of the additional liability may result in a material impact on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such additional liability is accrued in those cases where no accrual is recorded because it is not probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of any such loss cannot be reasonably estimated any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us may result in a material impact on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued 

our past operations included the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paints along with other companies we are and have been a defendant in a number of legal proceedings including individual personal injury actions purported class actions and actions brought by various counties cities school districts and other governmentrelated entities arising from the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paints the plaintiffs’ claims have been based upon various legal theories including negligence strict liability breach of warranty negligent misrepresentations and omissions fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions concert of action civil conspiracy violations of unfair trade practice and consumer protection laws enterprise liability market share liability public nuisance unjust enrichment and other theories the plaintiffs seek various damages and relief including personal injury and property damage costs relating to the detection and abatement of leadbased paint from buildings costs associated with a public education campaign medical monitoring costs and others we have also been a defendant in legal proceedings arising from the manufacture and sale of nonleadbased paints that seek recovery based upon various legal theories including the failure to adequately warn of potential exposure to lead during surface preparation when using nonleadbased paint on surfaces previously painted with leadbased paint we believe the litigation brought to date is without merit or subject to meritorious defenses and are vigorously defending such litigation we expect additional lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation may be filed against us in the future asserting similar or different legal theories and seeking similar or different types of damages and relief the company will continue to vigorously defend against any additional lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation that may be filed including utilizing all avenues of appeal if necessary 

notwithstanding our views on the merits litigation is inherently subject to many uncertainties and we ultimately may not prevail adverse court rulings or determinations of liability among other factors could affect the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation against us and encourage an increase in the number and nature of future claims and proceedings from time to time various legislation and administrative regulations have been enacted promulgated or proposed to impose obligations on present and former manufacturers of lead pigments and leadbased paints respecting asserted health concerns associated with such products or to overturn the effect of court decisions in which we and other manufacturers have been successful 

due to the uncertainties involved management is unable to predict the outcome of the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation the number or nature of possible future claims and proceedings or the effect any legislation andor administrative regulations may have on the litigation or against us further management cannot reasonably determine the scope or amount of the potential costs and liabilities related to such litigation or resulting from any such legislation and regulations except with respect to the california public nuisance litigation we have not accrued any amounts for such litigation because we do not believe it is probable that a loss has occurred and we believe it is not possible to estimate the range of potential losses as there is no substantive information upon which an estimate could be based in addition any potential liability that may result from any changes to legislation and regulations cannot reasonably be estimated due to the uncertainties associated with the amount of any such liability andor the nature of any other remedy which may be imposed in such litigation any potential liability determined to be attributable to us arising out of such litigation may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition we discuss the risks and uncertainties related to litigation including the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation in more detail in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8

summary 

• consolidated net sales increased 86 in the year to a record 1994 billion 

◦ net sales from stores in us and canada open more than twelve calendar months increased 60 in the year

• continued to invest in acquisitions expanding our product offerings and manufacturing capacity 

outlook 

the company navigated many uncertainties during 2021 including unprecedented raw material inflation industrywide supply chain disruptions as well as temporary changes in the demand for our products due to the impacts of the covid19 pandemic earlier in the year and the omicron variant later in the year despite the uncertainties our businesses continue to be wellpositioned and we have confidence in our longterm outlook 

the covid19 pandemic continues to evolve and disrupt normal activities in many segments of the global economy we continue to work with government and health authorities to operate our business including our companyoperated stores manufacturing plants and other facilities we also continue to follow recommended actions of government authorities and health officials in order to protect the health and wellbeing of our employees customers and their families worldwide 

as we look to 2022 we are encouraged by the demand environment which remains robust across our end markets our customers remain positive and we expect that jobs delayed by raw material availability issues in 2021 will be completed in the quarters ahead rather than cancelled we brought on 50 million gallons of incremental architectural paint production capacity in 2021 to meet this demand and will continue to add paint stores in 2022 we expect raw material availability to continue improving we are implementing additional price increases to offset to the sustained cost inflation and expect raw material costs will ultimately moderate enabling the recovery of our margins over time 

we intend to remain disciplined in our capital allocation approach focused on driving value for our customers and returns for our shareholders capital expenditures excluding our new global headquarters will remain modest at approximately 2 percent of sales and we will continue to pursue acquisitions that fit our strategy we expect to use any excess cash to make open market purchases of company stock our balance sheet remains strong and we expect debt to ebitda to approach the high end of our target of 20 to 25 times range

in accordance with the goodwill and other intangibles topic of the asc management tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level a reporting unit is an operating segment per the segment reporting topic of the asc or one level below the operating segment component level as determined by the availability of discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed by operating segment management or an aggregate of component levels of an operating segment having similar economic characteristics at the time of goodwill impairment testing if performing a quantitative assessment management determines fair value through the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved for each reporting unit if the calculated fair value is less than the current carrying value then impairment of the reporting unit exists the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model to determine estimated fair value is common practice in impairment testing the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model for impairment testing include discount rates growth rates cash flow projections and terminal value rates discount rates are set by using the weighted average cost of capital “wacc” methodology the wacc methodology considers market and industry data as well as companyspecific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rates to be used the discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business operational management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates sales projections and cash flow projections for each reporting unit terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates as an indicator that each reporting unit has been valued appropriately through the use of the discounted cash flow valuation model the aggregate of all reporting units’ fair value is reconciled to the total market capitalization of the company 

the company had seven components some of which are aggregated due to similar economic characteristics to form three reporting units also the operating segments with goodwill as of october 1 2021 the date of the annual impairment test the annual impairment review performed as of october 1 2021 did not result in any of the reporting units having impairment or deemed at risk for impairment 

in accordance with the goodwill and other intangibles topic of the asc management tests indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at the asset level as determined by appropriate asset valuations at acquisition management utilizes the royalty savings method and valuation model to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinitelived intangible asset or trademark in this method management estimates the royalty savings arising from the ownership of the intangible asset the key assumptions used in estimating the royalty savings for impairment testing include discount rates royalty rates growth rates sales projections terminal value rates and to a lesser extent tax rates discount rates used are similar to the rates developed by the wacc methodology considering any differences in companyspecific risk factors between reporting units and trademarks royalty rates are established by management and valuation experts and periodically substantiated by valuation experts operational management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates and sales projections for each significant trademark terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual sales estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates the royalty savings valuation methodology and calculations used in 2021 impairment testing are consistent with prior years the annual impairment review performed as of october 1 2021 did not result in any of the reporting units having impairment or deemed at risk for impairment 

the discounted cash flow and royalty savings valuation methodologies require management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the valuations are performed actual results could differ from these assumptions management believes the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value considering the current economic conditions see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of goodwill and intangible assets and the impairment tests performed in accordance with the goodwill and other intangibles topic of the asc 

valuation of longlived assets 

in accordance with the property plant and equipment topic of the asc if events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying value of longlived assets including operating lease rightofuse assets may not be recoverable or the useful life had changed impairment tests were performed or the useful life was adjusted undiscounted cash flows were used to calculate the recoverable value of longlived assets to determine if such assets were not recoverable if the carrying value of the assets was deemed to not be recoverable the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets as determined in accordance with the fair value topic of the asc if the usefulness of an asset was determined to be impaired then management estimated a new useful life based on the period of time for projected uses of the asset fair value approaches and changes in useful life required management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the valuation or determination was performed actual results could differ from these assumptions management believes the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value or useful life considering the current economic conditions all tested longlived assets or groups of longlived assets had undiscounted cash flows that were substantially in excess of their carrying value see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of the reductions in carrying value or useful life of longlived assets in accordance with the property plant and equipment topic of the asc see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for the property plant and equipment accounting policy 

defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

to determine the company’s ultimate obligation under its defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans management must estimate the future cost of benefits and attribute that cost to the time period during which each covered employee works to determine the obligations of such benefit plans management uses actuaries to calculate such amounts using key assumptions such as discount rates inflation longterm investment returns mortality employee turnover rate of compensation increases and medical and prescription drug costs management reviews all of these assumptions on an ongoing basis to ensure that the most current information available is being considered an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside management’s control could have a direct impact on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

in accordance with the retirement benefits topic of the asc the company recognizes each plan’s funded status as an asset for overfunded plans and as a liability for unfunded or underfunded plans actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs are recognized and recorded in aoci the amounts recorded in aoci will continue to be modified as actuarial assumptions and service costs change and all such amounts will be amortized to expense over a period of years through the net pension and net periodic benefit costs 

in 2022 pension costs are expected to decrease slightly and other postretirement benefit plan costs are expected to increase slightly based on the actuarial assumptions being applied see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for information concerning the company’s defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans 

environmental matters 

the company is involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of its currently and formerly owned sites including sites which were previously owned andor operated by businesses acquired by the company the company initially provides for estimated costs of environmentalrelated activities relating to its past operations and thirdparty sites for which commitments or cleanup plans have been developed and when such costs can be reasonably estimated based on industry standards and professional judgment these estimated costs which are mostly undiscounted are determined based on currently available facts regarding each site if the reasonably estimable costs can only be identified as a range and no specific amount within that range can be determined more likely than any other amount within the range the minimum of the range is provided 

the company continuously assesses its potential liability for investigation and remediationrelated activities and adjusts its environmentalrelated accruals as information becomes available upon which more accurate costs can be reasonably estimated and as additional accounting guidelines are issued actual costs incurred may vary from the accrued estimates due to the inherent uncertainties involved see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for information concerning the accrual for extended environmentalrelated activities and a discussion concerning unaccrued future loss contingencies 

litigation and other contingent liabilities 

in the course of its business the company is subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits including but not limited to litigation relating to product liability and warranty personal injury environmental intellectual property commercial contractual and antitrust claims management believes that the company has properly accrued for all known liabilities that existed and those where a loss was deemed probable for which a fair value was available or an amount could be reasonably estimated in accordance with us gaap however because litigation is inherently subject to many uncertainties and the ultimate result of any present or future litigation is unpredictable the company’s ultimate liability may result in costs that are significantly higher than currently accrued in the event that the company’s loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently accrued the recording of the liability may result in a material impact on net income for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued additionally due to the uncertainties involved any potential liability determined to be attributable to the company arising out of such litigation may have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations liquidity or financial condition see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for information concerning litigation 

income taxes 

the company estimated income taxes for each jurisdiction that it operated in this involved estimating taxable earnings specific taxable and deductible items the likelihood of generating sufficient future taxable income to utilize deferred tax assets and possible exposures related to future tax audits to the extent these estimates change adjustments to deferred and accrued income taxes will be made in the period in which the changes occur 

we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution these assessments of uncertain tax positions contain judgments related to the interpretation of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we transact business the judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits expiration of statutes of limitations as well as changes to or further interpretations of tax laws and regulations income tax expense is adjusted in our statements of consolidated income in the period in which these events occur see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for information concerning income taxes 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk associated with interest rates foreign currency and commodity fluctuations we occasionally utilize derivative instruments as part of our overall financial risk management policy but do not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes in 2021 and 2020 the company utilized us dollar to euro cross currency swap contracts to hedge the company’s net investment in its european operations the contracts have been designated as net investment hedges and have various maturity dates see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 the company entered into forward foreign currency exchange contracts during 2021 to hedge against value changes in foreign currency there were no material contracts outstanding at december 31 2021 forward foreign currency exchange contracts are described in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 we believe we may experience continuing losses from foreign currency fluctuations however we do not expect currency translation transaction or hedging contract losses to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

basis of reportable segments 

the company reports its segment information in the same way that management internally organizes its business for assessing performance and making decisions regarding allocation of resources in accordance with the segment reporting topic of the accounting standards codification asc the company has three reportable operating segments the americas group consumer brands group and performance coatings group individually a “reportable segment” and collectively the “reportable segments” factors considered in determining the three reportable segments of the company include the nature of business activities the management structure directly accountable to the company’s chief operating decision maker codm for operating and administrative activities availability of discrete financial information and information presented to the board of directors the company reports all other business activities and immaterial operating segments that are not reportable in the administrative segment for more information about the reportable segments see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

the company’s codm has been identified as the chief executive officer because he has final authority over performance assessment and resource allocation decisions because of the diverse operations of the company the codm regularly receives discrete financial information about each reportable segment as well as a significant amount of additional financial information about certain divisions business units or subsidiaries of the company the codm uses all such financial information for performance assessment and resource allocation decisions the codm evaluates the performance of and allocates resources to the reportable segments based on segment profit or loss and cash generated from operations the accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8

consumer brands group 

the consumer brands group supplies a broad portfolio of branded and privatelabel architectural paint stains varnishes industrial products wood finishes products wood preservatives applicators corrosion inhibitors aerosols caulks and adhesives to retailers and distributors throughout north america as well as in australia new zealand china and europe the consumer brands group also supports the company’s other businesses around the world with new product research and development manufacturing distribution and logistics approximately 55 of the total sales of the consumer brands group in 2020 were intersegment transfers of products primarily sold through the americas group at december 31 2020 the consumer brands group consisted of operations in the united states and subsidiaries in 6 foreign countries sales and marketing of certain controlled brand and privatelabel products is performed by a direct sales staff the products distributed through thirdparty customers are intended for resale to the ultimate enduser of the product the consumer brands group had sales to certain customers that individually may be a significant portion of the sales and related profitability of the segment this segment incurred most of the company’s capital expenditures related to ongoing environmental compliance measures at sites currently in operation the codm uses discrete financial information about the consumer brands group supplemented with information by product type and customer type to assess performance of and allocate resources to the consumer brands group as a whole in accordance with asc 28010509 the consumer brands group as a whole is considered the operating segment and because it meets the criteria in asc 280105010 it is also considered a reportable segment 

performance coatings group 

the performance coatings group develops and sells industrial coatings for wood finishing and general industrial metal and plastic applications automotive refinish protective and marine coatings coil coatings packaging coatings and performancebased resins and colorants worldwide this segment licenses certain technology and trade names worldwide sherwinwilliams ® and other controlled brand products are distributed through the americas group and this segment’s 282 companyoperated branches and by a direct sales staff and outside sales representatives to retailers dealers jobbers licensees and other thirdparty distributors the performance coatings group had sales to certain customers that individually may be a significant portion of the sales of the segment however the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on the overall profitability of the segment at december 31 2020 the performance coatings group consisted of operations in the united states and subsidiaries in 44 foreign countries the codm uses discrete financial information about the performance coatings group supplemented with information about geographic divisions business units and subsidiaries to assess performance of and allocate resources to the performance coatings group as a whole in accordance with asc 28010509 the performance coatings group as a whole is considered the operating segment and because it meets the criteria in asc 280105010 it is also considered a reportable segment 

administrative segment 

the administrative segment includes the administrative expenses of the company’s corporate headquarters site also included in the administrative segment is interest expense interest and investment income certain expenses related to closed facilities and environmentalrelated matters and other expenses which are not directly associated with the reportable segments the administrative segment does not include any significant foreign operations also included in the administrative segment is a real estate management unit that is responsible for the ownership management and leasing of nonretail properties held primarily for use by the company including the company’s headquarters site and disposal of idle facilities sales of this segment represent external leasing revenue of excess headquarters space or leasing of facilities no longer used by the company in its primary businesses material gains and losses from the sale of property are infrequent and not a significant operating factor in determining the performance of the administrative segment 

raw materials and products purchased for resale 

we believe we generally have adequate sources of raw materials and fuel supplies used in our business there are sufficient suppliers of each product purchased for resale that none of the reportable segments anticipate any significant sourcing problems during 2021 see item 1a risk factors for more information regarding cost and sourcing of raw materials 

seasonality 

the majority of the sales for the reportable segments traditionally occur during the second and third quarters however periods of economic downturn can alter these seasonal patterns there is no significant seasonality in sales for the administrative segment 

working capital 

in order to meet increased demand during the second and third quarters the company usually builds its inventories during the first quarter working capital items inventories and accounts receivable are generally financed through shortterm borrowings which include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of commercial paper for a description of the company’s liquidity and capital resources see the “financial condition liquidity and cash flow” section in item 7 

trademarks and trade names 

customer recognition of trademarks and trade names owned or licensed by the company collectively contribute significantly to our sales the major trademarks and trade names used by each of the reportable segments are set forth below

patents 

although patents and licenses are not of material importance to our business as a whole or any segment the americas group and the performance coatings group derive a portion of their income from the licensing of technology trademarks and trade names to foreign companies 

backlog and productive capacity 

backlog orders are not significant in the business of any reportable segment since there is normally a short period of time between the placing of an order and shipment we believe that sufficient productive capacity currently exists to fulfill our needs for paint coatings and related products through 2021 

competition 

we experience competition from many local regional national and international competitors of various sizes in the manufacture distribution and sale of our paint coatings and related products we are a leading manufacturer and retailer of paint coatings and related products to professional industrial commercial and retail customers however our competitive position varies for our different products and markets 

in the americas group competitors include other paint and wallpaper stores mass merchandisers home centers independent hardware stores hardware chains and manufactureroperated direct outlets product quality product innovation breadth of product line technical expertise service and price determine the competitive advantage for this segment

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks described below and in other documents we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

economic and strategic risks 

the covid19 pandemic has adversely impacted our business results of operations cash flow and financial condition and the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will adversely impact our business results of operations cash flow liquidity and financial condition in the future remains uncertain 

beginning in early 2020 extraordinary and wideranging actions have been taken by international federal state and local public health and governmental authorities to contain and combat the outbreak and spread of a novel strain of coronavirus covid19 these actions have included and continue to include quarantines physical distancing face coverings restrictions on public gatherings and other health and safety protocols stayathome orders travel restrictions mandatory business closures and other mandates that have substantially restricted individuals’ daily activities and curtailed or ceased many businesses’ normal operations 

in response to the pandemic and these actions we began implementing changes in our business in march 2020 designed to protect the health and wellbeing of our employees and customers and to support appropriate physical distancing and other health and safety protocols in late march 2020 we temporarily reduced store hours and closed our sales floors in our companyoperated paint stores to the general public requiring our customers to order product online or via phone and to access their products via curbside pickup or delivery we implemented remote alternate and flexible work arrangements where possible including implementing split shifts at facilities and remote work options for nonessential onsite functions enhanced cleaning and sanitation procedures transitioned some of our facilities to manufacture hand sanitizer for use in our facilities and surrounding communities implemented domestic and international travel restrictions implemented return to work and visitor screening protocols and postponed or canceled hosting or attending large events we also enhanced certain employee benefits such as telehealth paid sick leave family leave and voluntary leave of absence policies and programs in may 2020 we began the process of reinstituting regular store hours and reopening the sales floors in our stores with appropriate health and safety protocols which resulted in all of our stores in the us and canada being fully reopened we also began the process of returning some of our employees who work in office environments to the office although many employees continue to work remotely the necessary and appropriate measures we have taken have resulted in additional costs including for covidrelated leave and related healthcare costs in support of our employees and their families and have adversely impacted our business and financial performance we also face operational risks in connection with remote work arrangements including but not limited to cybersecurity risks and increased vulnerability to damage or interruption resulting from among other causes cyber attacks security breaches phishing malware viruses ransomware power outages or system failures as our response to the pandemic continues and evolves we expect to incur additional costs and are likely to experience further adverse impacts to our business each of which may be significant 

the covid19 outbreak has surfaced in all regions around the world and has severely impacted the global economy disrupted consumer spending and global supply chains and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets all of which are expected to continue and all of which have adversely affected and are expected to continue to adversely affect our business we continue to experience occasional temporary disruptions and closures of some of our facilities due to covid19 we also continue to see shifts in consumer behaviors and preferences as well as impacts in the demand for some of our products since the first quarter of 2020 we have experienced an unprecedented surge in doityourself diy demand due to some of our customers spending more time at home and focusing on home improvement projects as a result our architectural business was quick to recover from the onset of the pandemic while many of our industrial businesses are recovering at a slower pace as commercial and other industrial projects are delayed while we expect demand levels to return to more normalized levels eventually our ability to predict and meet any future changes in the demand for our products due to the pandemic remains uncertain although the raw materials used in the manufacturing distribution and sale of our products are typically available from various sources in sufficient quantities and although we have not experienced significant raw material shortages delays or increased costs to date covid19 may result in increased costs and unexpected shortages or delays in the delivery of some raw materials each of which could be significant we reduced spending in certain areas of our business including through voluntary and involuntary leave programs and reductions in capital expenditures temporarily suspending share repurchases and reducing discretionary spending and we may need to take additional actions to reduce spending in the future 

while we are closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic on all aspects of our business the extent of the impact on our results of operations cash flow liquidity and financial performance as well as our ability to execute nearterm and longterm business strategies and initiatives will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments which are highly uncertain and which we cannot predict or control and some of which we are not currently aware including but not limited to 

a the duration severity and scope of the pandemic including additional waves increases and spikes in the number of covid19 cases in certain areas b rapidlychanging governmental and public health directives to contain and combat the outbreak including the duration degree and effectiveness of directives as well as the easing removal and potential reinstitution of directives c the further development availability effectiveness and distribution of treatments and vaccines for covid19 d the extent and duration of the pandemic’s adverse and volatile effects on economic and social activity consumer confidence discretionary spending and preferences labor and healthcare costs and unemployment rates any of which may reduce demand for some of our products and impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us e our ability to sell provide and meet the demand for our services and products including as a result of potential reinstitution of temporarilyreduced store hours and sales floor closures in our stores and continued travel restrictions mandatory business closures and stayathome or similar orders f any temporary reduction in our workforce closures of our offices and facilities and our ability to adequately staff and maintain our operations including as a result of employees or their family members testing positive for covid19 g the ability of our customers and suppliers to continue their operations which could affect our ability to sell provide and meet the demand for our services and products and result in terminations of contracts losses of revenue and adverse effects to our supply chain and h any impairment in value of our tangible or intangible assets which could be recorded as a result of weaker economic conditions if the pandemic continues to create disruptions or turmoil in the credit or financial markets or further impacts our credit ratings it could adversely affect our ability to access capital on favorable terms and continue to meet our liquidity needs 

given the inherent uncertainty surrounding covid19 we expect the pandemic will continue to create challenging operating environments and have an adverse impact on our business in the near term if these conditions persist for a prolonged period the covid19 pandemic including any of the above factors and others that are currently unknown may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

adverse changes in general business and economic conditions in the united states and worldwide may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

our business is sensitive to global and regional business and economic conditions adverse changes in such conditions in the united states and worldwide including due to the covid19 pandemic may reduce the demand for some of our products adversely impact our ability to predict and meet any future changes in the demand for our products and impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us each of which could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition higher inflation rates interest rates tax rates and unemployment rates higher labor and healthcare costs recessions changing governmental policies laws and regulations business disruptions due to cybersecurity incidents terrorist activity armed conflict war public health crises including the covid19 pandemic impacts of climate change fires or other natural disasters and other economic factors could also adversely affect demand for some of our products our ability to predict and meet any future changes in the demand for our products the availability delivery or cost of raw materials our ability to adequately staff and maintain operations at affected facilities and our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition and that of our customers vendors and suppliers 

protracted duration of economic downturns in cyclical segments of the economy may depress the demand for some of our products and adversely affect our sales earnings cash flow or financial condition 

portions of our business involve the sale of paint coatings and related products to segments of the economy that are cyclical in nature particularly segments relating to construction housing manufacturing and oil production refining storage and transportation our sales to these segments are affected by the levels of discretionary consumer and business spending in these segments during economic downturns in these segments the levels of consumer and business discretionary spending may decrease and the recovery of these segments may lag behind the recovery of the overall economy this decrease in spending will likely reduce the demand for some of our products and may adversely affect our sales earnings cash flow or financial condition 

although interest rates remain low by historical standards any increase may adversely affect the demand for new residential homes existing home turnover and new nonresidential construction a worsening in these segments will reduce the demand for some of our products and may adversely impact sales earnings and cash flow 

in the us construction and housing segments the recent demand for new construction has caused contractors to experience a shortage of skilled workers resulting in project backlogs and an adverse effect on the growth rate of demand for our products while we expect to see higher demand for our products as project backlogs are reduced in the future this labor shortage may adversely impact our sales earnings cash flow or financial condition 

adverse weather conditions or impacts of climate change and natural disasters may temporarily reduce the demand for some of our products and could have a negative effect on our sales earnings or cash flow 

our business is seasonal in nature with the second and third quarters typically generating a higher proportion of sales and earnings than other quarters from time to time adverse weather conditions or impacts of climate change and natural disasters have had or may have an adverse effect on our sales of paint coatings and related products unusually cold and rainy weather could also have an adverse effect on sales of our exterior paint products an adverse effect on sales may cause a reduction in our earnings or cash flow 

financial risks 

a weakening of global credit markets may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

a weakening of global credit markets may adversely impact our net sales the collection of accounts receivable funding for working capital needs expected cash flow generation from current and acquired businesses access to capital and our investments which may adversely impact our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we finance a portion of our sales through trade credit credit markets remain tight and some customers who require financing for their businesses have not been able to obtain necessary financing a continuation or worsening of these conditions could limit our ability to collect our accounts receivable which could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we generally fund a portion of our seasonal working capital needs and obtain funding for other general corporate purposes through shortterm borrowings backed by our revolving credit facility and other financing facilities if any of the banks in these credit and financing facilities are unable to perform on their commitments such inability could adversely impact our cash flow liquidity or financial condition including our ability to obtain funding for working capital needs and other general corporate purposes 

although we currently have available credit facilities to fund our current operating needs we cannot be certain we will be able to replace our existing credit facilities or refinance our existing or future debt when necessary our cost of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by our debt and credit ratings assigned by the major credit rating agencies downgrades in these ratings including due to uncertainties regarding covid19 will increase our cost of borrowing and could have an adverse effect on our access to the capital markets including our access to the commercial paper market an inability to access the capital markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we have goodwill and intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet we periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such value may not be recoverable an impairment assessment involves judgment as to assumptions regarding future sales and cash flow and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions future events and changing market conditions may impact our assumptions and change our estimates of future sales and cash flow resulting in us incurring substantial impairment charges which would adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

we hold investments in equity and debt securities in some of our defined benefit pension plans a decrease in the value of plan assets resulting from a general financial downturn may cause a negative pension plan investment performance which may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we require a significant amount of cash to service the substantial amount of debt we have outstanding our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control we also depend on the business of our subsidiaries to satisfy our cash needs if we cannot generate the required cash we may not be able to make the necessary payments required under our indebtedness 

at december 31 2020 we had total debt of approximately 8292 billion which is a decrease of 3931 million since december 31 2019 we have the ability under our existing credit facilities to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future our ability to make payments on our debt fund our other liquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future our historical financial results have been and we anticipate our future financial results will be subject to fluctuations our ability to generate cash to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control including public health crises such as the covid19 pandemic and related impacts we cannot guarantee our business will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make payments of our debt fund other liquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures 

the degree to which we are currently leveraged could have important consequences for shareholders for example it could 

• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 

• increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions 

• limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future to enable us to react to changes in our business or 

• place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to businesses in our industry that have less debt 

additionally any failure to comply with covenants in the instruments governing our debt could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived would have a material adverse effect on us 

a significant portion of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries as a result our ability to generate sufficient cash flow for our needs is dependent to some extent on the earnings of our subsidiaries and the payment of those earnings to us in the form of dividends loans or advances and through repayment of loans or advances from us our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay any amounts due on our debt or to provide us with funds to meet our cash flow needs whether in the form of dividends distributions loans or other payments further any payment of dividends loans or advances by our subsidiaries could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions payments to us by our subsidiaries will also be contingent upon our subsidiaries’ earnings and business considerations our right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary’s creditors including trade creditors even if we are a creditor of any of our subsidiaries our rights as a creditor would be subordinate to any security interest in the assets of our subsidiaries and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries senior to that held by us finally changes in the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may adversely affect the ability of some of our foreign subsidiaries to repatriate funds to us 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

because of our international operations we are exposed to risk associated with interest rates and value changes in foreign currencies which may adversely affect our business historically our reported net sales earnings cash flow and financial condition have been subjected to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates our primary exchange rate exposure is with the euro the chinese yuan the brazilian real the canadian dollar the british pound the mexican peso the australian dollar and the argentine peso each against the us dollar while we actively manage the exposure of our foreign currency risk as part of our overall financial risk management policy we believe we may experience losses from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and such losses could adversely affect our sales earnings cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

operational risks 

unexpected shortages and increases in the cost of raw materials and energy may adversely affect our earnings or cash flow 

we purchase raw materials including titanium dioxide and petrochemical feedstock sources such as propylene and ethylene and energy for use in the manufacturing distribution and sale of our products factors such as political instability higher tariffs impacts of climate change and adverse weather conditions including hurricanes and other natural disasters or public health crises including the covid19 pandemic could disrupt the availability of raw material and fuel supplies adversely impact our ability to adequately staff and maintain operations at affected facilities and increase our costs in addition environmental and social regulations including regulations related to climate change may negatively impact us or our suppliers in terms of availability and cost of raw materials as well as sources and supply of energy although raw materials and energy supplies including oil and natural gas are generally available from various sources in sufficient quantities unexpected shortages and increases in the cost of raw materials and energy or any deterioration in our relationships with or the financial viability of our suppliers may have an adverse effect on our earnings or cash flow in the event we are unable to obtain these raw materials and energy from other sources or offset higher costs in a timely manner by sufficiently decreasing our operating costs or raising the prices of our products in recent years some raw material and energy prices have increased particularly titanium dioxide and petrochemical feedstock sources such as propylene and ethylene as well as metal and plastic packaging the cost of raw materials and energy has in the past experienced and likely will in the future continue to experience periods of volatility 

although we have an extensive customer base the loss of any of our largest customers could adversely affect our sales earnings or cash flow 

we have a large and varied customer base due to our extensive distribution platform during 2020 no individual customer accounted for sales totaling more than ten percent of our sales however we have some customers that individually purchase a large amount of products from us although our broad distribution channels help to minimize the impact of the loss of any one customer the loss of any of these large customers could have an adverse effect on our sales earnings or cash flow 

increased competition or failure to keep pace with developments in key competitive areas of our business may reduce our sales earnings or cash flow performance 

we face substantial competition from many international national regional and local competitors of various sizes in the manufacture distribution and sale of our paint coatings and related products some of our competitors are larger than us or operate more extensively in certain regions around the world and have greater financial or operational resources to compete other competitors are smaller and may be able to offer more specialized products technology product quality product innovation breadth of product line technical expertise distribution service and price are key competitive factors for our business competition in any of these areas or failure to keep pace with developments in any of these areas may reduce our sales and adversely affect our earnings or cash flow by resulting in decreased sales volumes reduced prices and increased costs of manufacturing distributing and selling our products 

our results of operations cash flow or financial condition may be negatively impacted if we do not successfully integrate future acquisitions into our existing operations and if the performance of the businesses we acquire do not meet our expectations 

we have historically made strategic acquisitions of businesses in the paint and coatings industry and will likely acquire additional businesses in the future as part of our longterm growth strategy the success of future acquisitions depends in large part on our ability to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired companies and manage challenges that may arise as a result of the acquisitions particularly when the acquired businesses operate in new or foreign markets in the event we do not successfully integrate such future acquisitions into our existing operations so as to realize the expected return on our investment our results of operations cash flow or financial condition could be adversely affected 

risks and uncertainties associated with our expansion into and our operations in asia europe south america and other foreign markets could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

net external sales of our consolidated foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately 195 206 and 230 of our total consolidated net sales in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively sales outside of the united states make up a significant part of our current business and future strategic plans our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition could be adversely affected by a variety of domestic and international factors including general economic conditions political instability inflation rates recessions tariffs foreign currency exchange rates foreign currency exchange controls interest rates foreign investment and repatriation restrictions legal and regulatory constraints civil unrest difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and other external economic and political factors in addition public health crises including the covid19 pandemic in foreign jurisdictions may temporarily reduce the demand for some of our products and adversely affect the availability and cost of raw materials our inability to successfully manage the risks and uncertainties relating to any of these factors could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

in many foreign countries it is acceptable to engage in certain business practices we are prohibited from engaging in because of regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act recent years have seen a substantial increase in antibribery law enforcement activity with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both us and nonus regulators and an increase in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals although we have internal control policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these regulations there can be no assurance our policies and procedures will prevent a violation of these regulations any violation could cause an adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

policy changes affecting international trade could adversely impact the demand for our products and our competitive position 

due to the international scope of our operations changes in government policies on foreign trade and investment may affect the demand for our products and services impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries our business benefits from free trade agreements which may include the united statesmexicocanada agreement and efforts to withdraw from or substantially modify such agreements in addition to the implementation of more restrictive trade policies such as more detailed inspections higher tariffs import or export licensing requirements exchange controls or new barriers to entry could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or cash flow and that of our customers vendors and suppliers 

additionally the results of the united kingdom’s referendum on european union membership which resulted in the united kingdom’s exit from the european union on january 31 2020 “brexit” caused significant volatility in global stock markets currency exchange rate fluctuations and global economic uncertainty the transition period postbrexit expired on december 31 2020 and the united kingdom and european union entered into a free trade agreement that now governs the united kingdom’s relationship with the european union while the united kingdom and european union can generally continue to trade with each other without the imposition of tariffs for imports and exports there are new customs requirements that require additional documentation and data and there are also new controls on the movement and reporting of goods including 

chemicals we do not know the extent to which brexit and the free trade agreement will ultimately impact the business and regulatory environment in the united kingdom the rest of the european union or other countries although it is possible there will be tighter controls and administrative requirements for imports and exports between the united kingdom and the european union or other countries as well as increased regulatory complexities any of these factors could adversely impact customer demand our relationships with customers and suppliers and our results of operations 

cybersecurity incidents and other disruptions to our information technology systems could interfere with our operations result in the compromise or loss of critical and confidential information and severely harm our business 

we rely on information technology systems to conduct our business including recording and processing transactions manufacturing and selling our products maintaining and growing our competitive position and supporting and communicating with our employees customers suppliers and other vendors these information technology systems are important to many businesscritical processes including but not limited to production planning manufacturing finance company operations sales and customer service some of these systems are maintained or operated by third party providers despite our efforts to prevent disruptions to these information technology systems these systems may be affected by damage or interruption resulting from among other causes cyber attacks security breaches phishing malware viruses ransomware power outages or system failures these risks could be magnified due to the increased reliance on information technology systems because of the covid19 pandemic disruptions to these systems may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

as part of our business we collect and handle sensitive and confidential information about our business customers employees and suppliers despite the security measures we have in place our facilities and systems and those thirdparties with which we do business may be vulnerable to cyber attacks security breaches malware viruses ransomware power outages system failures acts of vandalism or misconduct human or technical errors or other similar events or disruptions any such event involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of information whether impacting us or thirdparties with which we do business could result in losses damage our reputation expose us to the risks of litigation regulatory action and liability disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we continue to mitigate these risks in a number of ways including through additional investment engagement of thirdparty experts and consultants improving the security of our facilities and systems providing training for employees assessing the continued appropriateness of relevant insurance coverage and strengthening our controls to monitor and mitigate these threats 

the domestic and international regulatory environment related to information security collection and privacy is increasingly rigorous and complex with new and rapidly changing requirements applicable to our business compliance with these requirements including the european union’s general data protection regulation the california consumer privacy act and other international and domestic regulations could result in additional costs and changes to our business practices 

inability to protect or enforce our material trademarks and other intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our business 

we have numerous patents trade secrets trademarks trade names and knowhow that are valuable to our business despite our efforts to protect such intellectual property and other proprietary information from unauthorized use or disclosure third parties may attempt to disclose obtain or use our trademarks or such other intellectual property and information without our authorization although we rely on the patent trademark trade secret and copyright laws of the united states and other countries to protect our intellectual property rights the laws of some countries may not protect such rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties the failure of foreign countries to have laws to protect our intellectual property rights or an inability to effectively enforce such rights in foreign countries could have an adverse effect on our business 

legal and regulatory risks 

we are subject to a wide variety of complex domestic and foreign laws rules and regulations for which compliance could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

we are subject to a wide variety of complex domestic and foreign laws rules and regulations and legal compliance risks including securities laws tax laws employment and pensionrelated laws competition laws us and foreign export and trading laws data privacy and security laws and laws governing improper business practices we are affected by new laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations including interpretations by courts and regulators from time to time our company our operations and the industries in which we operate are being reviewed or investigated by regulators which could lead to enforcement actions or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages 

although we believe we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to mitigate these risks the global and diverse nature of our operations means compliance risks will continue to exist investigations examinations and other proceedings the nature and outcome of which cannot be predicted will likely arise from time to time these investigations 

examinations and other proceedings could subject us to significant liability and require us to take significant accruals or pay significant settlements fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

we are subject to tax laws and regulations in the united states and multiple foreign jurisdictions we are affected by changes in tax laws and regulations as well as changes in related interpretations and other tax guidance in the ordinary course of our business we are subject to examinations and investigations by various tax authorities and other regulators in addition to existing examinations and investigations there could be additional examinations and investigations in the future and existing examinations and investigations could be expanded 

for nonincome tax risks we estimate material loss contingencies and accrue for such loss contingencies as required by us generally accepted accounting principles based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency in the event the loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently accrued the recording of the additional liability may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such additional liability is accrued in those cases where no accrual is recorded because it is not probable a liability has been incurred and cannot be reasonably estimated any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued or paid for income tax risks we recognize tax benefits based on our assessment that a tax benefit has a greater than 50 likelihood of being sustained upon ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant facts for those income tax positions where we determine there is not a greater than 50 likelihood such tax benefits will be sustained we do not recognize a tax benefit in our financial statements subsequent events may cause us to change our assessment of the likelihood of sustaining a previouslyrecognized benefit which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial position for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued or paid 

we discuss risks and uncertainties with regard to taxes in more detail in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

we are required to comply with numerous complex and increasingly stringent domestic and foreign health safety and environmental laws regulations and requirements the cost of which is likely to increase and may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

our operations are subject to various domestic and foreign health safety and environmental laws regulations and requirements including related to climate change and the covid19 pandemic these laws regulations and requirements not only govern our current operations and products but also impose potential liability on us for our past operations we expect health safety and environmental laws regulations and requirements to be increasingly stringent upon our industry and us in the future our costs to comply with these laws regulations and requirements may increase as they become more stringent in the future and these increased costs may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

we are involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of our currently and formerly owned sites as well as a number of thirdparty sites for which our ultimate liability may exceed the current amount we have accrued 

we are involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of our currently and formerly owned sites and a number of thirdparty sites we accrue for estimated costs of investigation and remediation activities at these sites for which commitments or cleanup plans have been developed and when such costs can be reasonably estimated based on industry standards and professional judgment these estimated costs are based on currently available facts regarding each site we continuously assess our potential liability for investigation and remediation activities and adjust our environmentalrelated accruals as information becomes available upon which more accurate costs can be reasonably estimated due to the uncertainties surrounding environmental investigation and remediation activities our liability may result in costs that are significantly higher than currently accrued and may have an adverse effect on our earnings we discuss these risks and uncertainties in more detail in the “environmental matters” and “environmentalrelated liabilities” sections in item 7 and in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

the nature cost quantity and outcome of pending and future litigation such as litigation arising from the historical manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paint could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity and financial condition 

in the course of our business we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits including but not limited to litigation relating to product liability and warranty personal injury environmental including natural resource damages intellectual property 

commercial contractual and antitrust claims that are inherently subject to many uncertainties regarding the possibility of a loss to us these uncertainties will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur confirming the incurrence of a liability or the reduction of a liability in accordance with the contingencies topic of the asc we accrue for these contingencies by a charge to income when it is both probable that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact of a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated in the event a loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently accrued the recording of the additional liability may result in a material impact on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such additional liability is accrued in those cases where no accrual is recorded because it is not probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of any such loss cannot be reasonably estimated any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us may result in a material impact on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued 

our past operations included the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paints along with other companies we are and have been a defendant in a number of legal proceedings including individual personal injury actions purported class actions and actions brought by various counties cities school districts and other governmentrelated entities arising from the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paints the plaintiffs’ claims have been based upon various legal theories including negligence strict liability breach of warranty negligent misrepresentations and omissions fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions concert of action civil conspiracy violations of unfair trade practice and consumer protection laws enterprise liability market share liability public nuisance unjust enrichment and other theories the plaintiffs seek various damages and relief including personal injury and property damage costs relating to the detection and abatement of leadbased paint from buildings costs associated with a public education campaign medical monitoring costs and others we have also been a defendant in legal proceedings arising from the manufacture and sale of nonleadbased paints that seek recovery based upon various legal theories including the failure to adequately warn of potential exposure to lead during surface preparation when using nonleadbased paint on surfaces previously painted with leadbased paint we believe the litigation brought to date is without merit or subject to meritorious defenses and are vigorously defending such litigation we expect additional lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation may be filed against us in the future asserting similar or different legal theories and seeking similar or different types of damages and relief the company will continue to vigorously defend against any additional lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation that may be filed including utilizing all avenues of appeal if necessary 

notwithstanding our views on the merits litigation is inherently subject to many uncertainties and we ultimately may not prevail adverse court rulings or determinations of liability among other factors could affect the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation against us and encourage an increase in the number and nature of future claims and proceedings from time to time various legislation and administrative regulations have been enacted promulgated or proposed to impose obligations on present and former manufacturers of lead pigments and leadbased paints respecting asserted health concerns associated with such products or to overturn the effect of court decisions in which we and other manufacturers have been successful 

due to the uncertainties involved management is unable to predict the outcome of the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation the number or nature of possible future claims and proceedings or the effect any legislation andor administrative regulations may have on the litigation or against us further management cannot reasonably determine the scope or amount of the potential costs and liabilities related to such litigation or resulting from any such legislation and regulations except with respect to the california public nuisance litigation we have not accrued any amounts for such litigation because we do not believe it is probable that a loss has occurred and we believe it is not possible to estimate the range of potential losses as there is no substantive information upon which an estimate could be based any potential liability that may result from any changes to legislation and regulations cannot reasonably be estimated due to the uncertainties associated with the amount of any such liability andor the nature of any other remedy which may be imposed in such litigation any potential liability determined to be attributable to us arising out of such litigation may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition we discuss the risks and uncertainties related to litigation including the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation in more detail in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8

for 2021 net pension cost for the ongoing domestic pension plan the company will use a discount rate of 29 an expected longterm rate of return on assets of 50 and a rate of compensation increase of 30 lower discount rates and expected longterm rates of return on plan assets will be used for most foreign plans for 2021 net periodic benefit costs for other postretirement benefits the company will use a discount rate of 25 net pension cost in 2021 for the ongoing domestic pension plan is expected to be approximately 17 million net periodic benefit costs for other postretirement benefits in 2021 is expected to be approximately 113 million see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information on the company’s obligations and funded status of its defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits 

deferred income taxes

other longterm liabilities 

other longterm liabilities increased 1770 million during 2020 due primarily to legislatively authorized tax payment deferral mechanisms available primarily for us federal payroll withholding taxes until 2021 and 2022 and the net investment hedges being in a net loss position at december 31 2020 see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information on the net investment hedges 

environmentalrelated liabilities 

the operations of the company like those of other companies in the same industry are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations these laws and regulations not only govern current operations and products but also impose potential liability on the company for past operations management expects environmental laws and regulations to impose increasingly stringent requirements upon the company and the industry in the future management believes that the company conducts its operations in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and has implemented various programs designed to protect the environment and promote continued compliance

warranty accruals acquired in connection with the valspar acquisition in 2017 include warranties for certain products under extended furniture protection plans the decrease in the accrual in 2018 was primarily due to the divestiture of the furniture protection plan business during the third quarter of 2018 for an immaterial amount that approximated net book value 

shareholders’ equity 

shareholders’ equity decreased 5125 million to 3611 billion at december 31 2020 from 4123 billion last year the decrease was primarily attributable to the company repurchasing 2446 billion in treasury stock and declaring 4880 million in cash dividends partially offset by 2030 billion of net income an increase of 2508 million associated with the recognition of stockbased compensation expense and stock option exercises and an increase of 1824 million from the issuance of treasury stock during the year during the fourth quarter of 2020 the company retired 306 million common stock shares held in treasury which resulted in decreases of common stock retained earnings and treasury stock of 306 million 8062 billion and 8092 billion respectively see the statements of consolidated shareholders’ equity and statements of consolidated comprehensive income in item 8 for additional information

cash flow 

net operating cash increased 1087 billion in 2020 to a cash source of 3409 billion from 2321 billion in 2019 due primarily to an increase in net income and improved working capital management partially offset by unfavorable changes in noncash items when compared to 2019 net operating cash increased as a percent to sales to 186 in 2020 compared to 130 in 2019 during 2020 strong net operating cash continued to provide the funds necessary to pay down total net debt invest in new stores and manufacturing and distribution facilities and return cash to shareholders through treasury stock purchases and dividends paid

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements these determinations were made based upon management’s best estimates judgments and assumptions that were believed to be reasonable under the circumstances giving due consideration to materiality we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions related to the accounting policies described below however application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and as a result actual results could differ from these estimates 

all of the significant accounting policies that were followed in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 management believes that the following critical accounting policies and estimates have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

inventories 

inventories were stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost determined principally on the lastin firstout lifo method based on inventory quantities and costs determined during the fourth quarter inventory quantities were adjusted during the fourth quarter as a result of annual physical inventory counts taken at all locations if inventories accounted for on the lifo method are reduced on a yearoveryear basis then liquidation of certain quantities carried at costs prevailing in prior years occurs management recorded the best estimate of net realizable value for obsolete and discontinued inventories based on historical experience and current trends through reductions to inventory cost by recording a provision included in cost of goods sold if management estimates that the reasonable market value is below cost or determines that future demand was lower than current inventory levels based on historical experience current and projected market demand current and projected volume trends and other relevant current and projected factors associated with the current economic conditions a reduction in inventory cost to estimated net realizable value is provided for in the reserve for obsolescence see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for more information regarding the impact of the lifo inventory valuation and the reserve for obsolescence 

goodwill and intangible assets 

in accordance with the goodwill and other intangibles topic of the asc management performs impairment tests of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets on an annual basis as well as whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate impairment has more likely than not occurred an optional qualitative assessment allows companies to skip the annual quantitative test if it is not more likely than not that impairment has occurred based on monitoring key company financial performance metrics and macroeconomic conditions the qualitative assessment is performed when deemed appropriate 

in accordance with the goodwill and other intangibles topic of the asc management tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level a reporting unit is an operating segment per the segment reporting topic of the asc or one level below the operating segment component level as determined by the availability of discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed by operating segment management or an aggregate of component levels of an operating segment having similar economic characteristics at the time of goodwill impairment testing if performing a quantitative assessment management determines fair value through the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved for each reporting unit if the calculated fair value is less than the current carrying value then impairment of the reporting unit exists the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model to determine estimated fair value is common practice in impairment testing the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model for impairment testing include discount rates growth rates cash flow projections and terminal value rates discount rates are set by using the weighted average cost of capital “wacc” methodology the wacc methodology considers market and industry data as well as companyspecific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rates to be used the discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business operational management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates sales projections and cash flow projections for each reporting unit terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates as an indicator that each reporting unit has been valued appropriately through the use of the discounted cash flow valuation model the aggregate of all reporting units’ fair value is reconciled to the total market capitalization of the company 

the company had seven components some of which are aggregated due to similar economic characteristics to form three reporting units also the operating segments with goodwill as of october 1 2020 the date of the annual impairment test the annual impairment review performed as of october 1 2020 did not result in any of the reporting units having impairment or deemed at risk for impairment 

in accordance with the goodwill and other intangibles topic of the asc management tests indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at the asset level as determined by appropriate asset valuations at acquisition management utilizes the royalty savings method and valuation model to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinitelived intangible asset or trademark in this method management estimates the royalty savings arising from the ownership of the intangible asset the key assumptions used in estimating the royalty savings for impairment testing include discount rates royalty rates growth rates sales projections terminal value rates and to a lesser extent tax rates discount rates used are similar to the rates developed by the wacc methodology considering any differences in companyspecific risk factors between reporting units and trademarks royalty rates are established by management and valuation experts and periodically substantiated by valuation experts operational management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates and sales projections for each significant trademark terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual sales estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates the royalty savings valuation methodology and calculations used in 2020 impairment testing are consistent with prior years the annual impairment review performed as of october 1 2020 resulted in the company recognizing noncash pretax impairment charges totaling 23 million related to lower than anticipated sales of an acquired indefinitelived trademark 

the discounted cash flow and royalty savings valuation methodologies require management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the valuations are performed actual results could differ from these assumptions management believes the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value considering the current economic conditions see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of goodwill and intangible assets and the impairment tests performed in accordance with the goodwill and other intangibles topic of the asc 

valuation of longlived assets 

in accordance with the property plant and equipment topic of the asc if events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying value of longlived assets including operating lease rightofuse assets may not be recoverable or the useful life had changed impairment tests were performed or the useful life was adjusted undiscounted cash flows were used to calculate the recoverable value of longlived assets to determine if such assets were not recoverable if the carrying value of the assets was deemed to not be recoverable the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets as determined in accordance with the fair value topic of the asc if the usefulness of an asset was determined to be impaired then management estimated a new useful life based on the period of time for projected uses of the asset fair value approaches and changes in useful life required management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the valuation or determination was performed actual results could differ from these assumptions management believes the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value or useful life considering the current economic conditions all tested longlived assets or groups of longlived assets had undiscounted cash flows that were substantially in excess of their carrying value see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of the reductions in carrying value or useful life of longlived assets in accordance with the property plant and equipment topic of the asc see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for the property plant and equipment accounting policy 

defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

to determine the company’s ultimate obligation under its defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans  management must estimate the future cost of benefits and attribute that cost to the time period during which each covered employee works to determine the obligations of such benefit plans management uses actuaries to calculate such amounts using key assumptions such as discount rates inflation longterm investment returns mortality employee turnover rate of compensation increases and medical and prescription drug costs management reviews all of these assumptions on an ongoing basis to ensure that the most current information available is being considered an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside management’s control could have a direct impact on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

in accordance with the retirement benefits topic of the asc the company recognizes each plan’s funded status as an asset for overfunded plans and as a liability for unfunded or underfunded plans actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs are recognized and recorded in aoci the amounts recorded in aoci will continue to be modified as actuarial assumptions and service costs change and all such amounts will be amortized to expense over a period of years through the net pension and net periodic benefit costs 

in 2021 pension costs are expected to decrease slightly and other postretirement benefit plan costs are expected to increase slightly based on the actuarial assumptions being applied see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for information concerning the company’s defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans 

environmental matters 

the company is involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of its currently and formerly owned sites including sites which were previously owned andor operated by businesses acquired by the company the company initially provides for estimated costs of environmentalrelated activities relating to its past operations and thirdparty sites for which commitments or cleanup plans have been developed and when such costs can be reasonably estimated based on industry standards and professional judgment these estimated costs which are mostly undiscounted are determined based on currently available facts regarding each site if the reasonably estimable costs can only be identified as a range and no specific amount within that range can be determined more likely than any other amount within the range the minimum of the range is provided 

the company continuously assesses its potential liability for investigation and remediationrelated activities and adjusts its environmentalrelated accruals as information becomes available upon which more accurate costs can be reasonably estimated and as additional accounting guidelines are issued actual costs incurred may vary from the accrued estimates due to the inherent uncertainties involved see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for information concerning the accrual for extended environmentalrelated activities and a discussion concerning unaccrued future loss contingencies 

litigation and other contingent liabilities 

in the course of its business the company is subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits including but not limited to litigation relating to product liability and warranty personal injury environmental intellectual property commercial contractual and antitrust claims management believes that the company has properly accrued for all known liabilities that existed and those where a loss was deemed probable for which a fair value was available or an amount could be reasonably estimated in accordance with us gaap however because litigation is inherently subject to many uncertainties and the ultimate result of any present or future litigation is unpredictable the company’s ultimate liability may result in costs that are significantly higher than currently accrued in the event that the company’s loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently accrued the recording of the liability may result in a material impact on net income for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued additionally due to the uncertainties involved any potential liability determined to be attributable to the company arising out of such litigation may have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations liquidity or financial condition see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for information concerning litigation 

income taxes 

the company estimated income taxes for each jurisdiction that it operated in this involved estimating taxable earnings specific taxable and deductible items the likelihood of generating sufficient future taxable income to utilize deferred tax assets and possible exposures related to future tax audits to the extent these estimates change adjustments to deferred and accrued income taxes will be made in the period in which the changes occur 

we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution these assessments of uncertain tax positions contain judgments related to the interpretation of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we transact business the judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits expiration of statutes of limitations as well as changes to or further interpretations of tax laws and regulations income tax expense is adjusted in our statements of consolidated income in the period in which these events occur see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for information concerning income taxes 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk associated with interest rates foreign currency and commodity fluctuations we occasionally utilize derivative instruments as part of our overall financial risk management policy but do not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes in 2019 and 2020 the company entered into us dollar to euro cross currency swap contracts to hedge the company’s net investment in its european operations the contracts have been designated as net investment hedges and have various maturity dates see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 the company entered into forward foreign currency exchange contracts during 2020 to hedge against value changes in foreign currency there were no material contracts outstanding at december 31 2020 forward foreign currency exchange contracts are described in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 we believe we may experience continuing losses from foreign currency fluctuations however we do not expect currency translation transaction or hedging contract losses to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

administrative segment 

the administrative segment includes the administrative expenses of the company’s corporate headquarters site also included in the administrative segment is interest expense interest and investment income certain expenses related to closed facilities and environmentalrelated matters and other expenses which are not directly associated with the reportable segments the administrative segment does not include any significant foreign operations also included in the administrative segment is a real estate management unit that is responsible for the ownership management and leasing of nonretail properties held primarily for use by the company including the company’s headquarters site and disposal of idle facilities sales of this segment represent external leasing revenue of excess headquarters space or leasing of facilities no longer used by the company in its primary businesses material gains and losses from the sale of property are infrequent and not a significant operating factor in determining the performance of the administrative segment 

raw materials and products purchased for resale 

we believe we generally have adequate sources of raw materials and fuel supplies used in our business there are sufficient suppliers of each product purchased for resale that none of the reportable segments anticipate any significant sourcing problems during 2020  see item 1a risk factors for more information regarding cost and sourcing of raw materials 

seasonality 

the majority of the sales for the reportable segments traditionally occur during the second and third quarters there is no significant seasonality in sales for the administrative segment 

working capital 

in order to meet increased demand during the second and third quarters the company usually builds its inventories during the first quarter working capital items inventories and accounts receivable are generally financed through shortterm borrowings which include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of commercial paper for a description of the company’s liquidity and capital resources see the “financial condition liquidity and cash flow” section in item 7 

trademarks and trade names 

customer recognition of our trademarks and trade names collectively contribute significantly to our sales the major trademarks and trade names used by each of the reportable segments are set forth below 

 patents 

although patents and licenses are not of material importance to our business as a whole or any segment the americas group and the performance coatings group derive a portion of their income from the licensing of technology trademarks and trade names to foreign companies 

backlog and productive capacity 

backlog orders are not significant in the business of any reportable segment since there is normally a short period of time between the placing of an order and shipment we believe that sufficient productive capacity currently exists to fulfill our needs for paint coatings and related products through 2020  

competition 

we experience competition from many local regional national and international competitors of various sizes in the manufacture distribution and sale of our paint coatings and related products we are a leading manufacturer and retailer of paint coatings and related products to professional industrial commercial and retail customers however our competitive position varies for our different products and markets 

in the americas group competitors include other paint and wallpaper stores mass merchandisers home centers independent hardware stores hardware chains and manufactureroperated direct outlets product quality product innovation breadth of product line technical expertise service and price determine the competitive advantage for this segment 

in the consumer brands group domestic and foreign competitors include manufacturers and distributors of branded and privatelabel paint and coatings products technology product quality product innovation breadth of product line technical expertise distribution service and price are the key competitive factors for this segment 

the performance coatings group has numerous competitors in its domestic and foreign markets with broad product offerings and several others with niche products key competitive factors for this segment include technology product quality product innovation breadth of product line technical expertise distribution service and price 

the administrative segment has many competitors consisting of other real estate owners developers and managers in areas in which this segment owns property the main competitive factors are the availability of property and price 

employees

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks described below and in other documents we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

adverse changes in general business and economic conditions in the united states and worldwide may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

our business is sensitive to global and regional business and economic conditions adverse changes in such conditions in the united states and worldwide may reduce the demand for some of our products and impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us each of which could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition higher inflation rates interest rates tax rates and unemployment rates higher labor and healthcare costs recessions changing governmental policies laws and regulations business disruptions due to cybersecurity incidents terrorist activity armed conflict war public health crises fires or other natural disasters and other economic factors could also adversely affect demand for some of our products availability and cost of raw materials and our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition and that of our customers vendors and suppliers 

a weakening or reversal of the general economic recovery in the united states and other countries and regions in which we do business or the continuation or worsening of economic downturns in other countries and regions may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

global economic uncertainty continues to exist a weakening or reversal of the general economic recovery in the united states and other countries and regions in which we do business or the continuation or worsening of economic downturns in other countries and regions may adversely impact our net sales the collection of accounts receivable funding for working capital needs expected cash flow generation from current and acquired businesses and our investments which may adversely impact our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we finance a portion of our sales through trade credit credit markets remain tight and some customers who require financing for their businesses have not been able to obtain necessary financing a continuation or worsening of these conditions could limit our ability to collect our accounts receivable which could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we generally fund a portion of our seasonal working capital needs and obtain funding for other general corporate purposes through shortterm borrowings backed by our revolving credit facility and other financing facilities if any of the banks in these credit and financing facilities are unable to perform on their commitments such inability could adversely impact our cash flow liquidity or financial condition including our ability to obtain funding for working capital needs and other general corporate purposes 

although we currently have available credit facilities to fund our current operating needs we cannot be certain we will be able to replace our existing credit facilities or refinance our existing or future debt when necessary our cost of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by our debt and credit ratings assigned by the major credit rating agencies downgrades in these ratings will increase our cost of borrowing and could have an adverse effect on our access to the capital markets including our access to the commercial paper market an inability to access the capital markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we have goodwill and intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet we periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such value may not be recoverable an impairment assessment involves judgment as to assumptions regarding future sales and cash flow and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions future events and changing market conditions may impact our assumptions and change our estimates of future sales and cash flow resulting in us incurring substantial impairment charges which would adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

we hold investments in equity and debt securities in some of our defined benefit pension plans a decrease in the value of plan assets resulting from a general financial downturn may cause a negative pension plan investment performance which may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

protracted duration of economic downturns in cyclical segments of the economy may depress the demand for some of our products and adversely affect our sales earnings cash flow or financial condition 

portions of our business involve the sale of paint coatings and related products to segments of the economy that are cyclical in nature particularly segments relating to construction housing manufacturing and oil production refining storage and transportation our sales to these segments are affected by the levels of discretionary consumer and business spending in these segments during economic downturns in these segments the levels of consumer and business discretionary spending may decrease and the recovery of these segments may lag behind the recovery of the overall economy this decrease in spending will likely reduce the demand for some of our products and may adversely affect our sales earnings cash flow or financial condition 

although interest rates remain low by historical standards any increase may adversely affect the demand for new residential homes existing home turnover and new nonresidential construction a worsening in these segments will reduce the demand for some of our products and may adversely impact sales earnings and cash flow 

in the us construction and housing segments the recent demand for new construction has caused contractors to experience a shortage of skilled workers resulting in project backlogs and an adverse effect on the growth rate of demand for our products while we expect to see higher demand for our products as project backlogs are reduced in the future this labor shortage may adversely impact our sales earnings cash flow or financial condition 

increases in the cost of raw materials and energy may adversely affect our earnings or cash flow 

we purchase raw materials including titanium dioxide and petrochemical feedstock sources such as propylene and ethylene and energy for use in the manufacturing distribution and sale of our products factors such as political instability higher tariffs and adverse weather conditions including hurricanes and other natural disasters can disrupt raw material and fuel supplies and increase our costs in addition environmental and social regulations including regulations related to climate change may negatively impact us or our suppliers in terms of availability and cost of raw materials as well as sources and supply of energy although raw materials and energy supplies including oil and natural gas are generally available from various sources in sufficient quantities unexpected 

shortages and increases in the cost of raw materials and energy or any deterioration in our relationships with or the financial viability of our suppliers may have an adverse effect on our earnings or cash flow in the event we are unable to offset higher costs in a timely manner by sufficiently decreasing our operating costs or raising the prices of our products in recent years some raw material and energy prices have increased particularly titanium dioxide and petrochemical feedstock sources such as propylene and ethylene as well as metal and plastic packaging the cost of raw materials and energy has in the past experienced and likely will in the future continue to experience periods of volatility 

although we have an extensive customer base the loss of any of our largest customers could adversely affect our sales earnings or cash flow 

we have a large and varied customer base due to our extensive distribution network during 2019  no individual customer accounted for sales totaling more than ten percent of our sales however we have some customers that individually purchase a large amount of products from us although our broad distribution channels help to minimize the impact of the loss of any one customer the loss of any of these large customers could have an adverse effect on our sales earnings or cash flow 

increased competition may reduce our sales earnings or cash flow performance 

we face substantial competition from many international national regional and local competitors of various sizes in the manufacture distribution and sale of our paint coatings and related products some of our competitors are larger than us and have greater financial resources to compete other competitors are smaller and may be able to offer more specialized products technology product quality product innovation breadth of product line technical expertise distribution service and price are the key competitive factors for our business competition in any of these areas may reduce our sales and adversely affect our earnings or cash flow by resulting in decreased sales volumes reduced prices and increased costs of manufacturing distributing and selling our products 

we require a significant amount of cash to service the substantial amount of debt we have outstanding our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control we also depend on the business of our subsidiaries to satisfy our cash needs if we cannot generate the required cash we may not be able to make the necessary payments required under our indebtedness 

at december 31 2019  we had total debt of approximately 87 billion  which is a decrease of 6585 million since december 31 2018  we have the ability under our existing credit facilities to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future our ability to make payments on our debt fund our other liquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future our historical financial results have been and we anticipate our future financial results will be subject to fluctuations our ability to generate cash to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control we cannot guarantee our business will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make payments of our debt fund other liquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures 

the degree to which we are currently leveraged could have important consequences for shareholders for example it could 

 additionally any failure to comply with covenants in the instruments governing our debt could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived would have a material adverse effect on us 

a significant portion of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries as a result our ability to generate sufficient cash flow for our needs is dependent to some extent on the earnings of our subsidiaries and the payment of those earnings to us in the form of dividends loans or advances and through repayment of loans or advances from us our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay any amounts due on our debt or to provide us with funds to meet our cash flow needs whether in the form of dividends distributions loans or other payments in addition any payment of dividends loans or advances by our subsidiaries could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions payments to us by our subsidiaries will also be contingent upon our subsidiaries’ earnings and business considerations our right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary’s creditors including trade creditors in addition even if we are a creditor of any of our subsidiaries our rights as a creditor would be subordinate to any security interest in the assets of our subsidiaries and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries senior to that held by us finally changes in the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may adversely affect the ability of some of our foreign subsidiaries to repatriate funds to us 

our results of operations cash flow or financial condition may be negatively impacted if we do not successfully integrate future acquisitions into our existing operations and if the performance of the businesses we acquire do not meet our expectations 

we have historically made strategic acquisitions of businesses in the paint and coatings industry and will likely acquire additional businesses in the future as part of our longterm growth strategy the success of future acquisitions depends in large part on our ability to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired companies and manage challenges that may arise as a result of the acquisitions particularly when the acquired businesses operate in new or foreign markets in the event we do not successfully integrate such future acquisitions into our existing operations so as to realize the expected return on our investment our results of operations cash flow or financial condition could be adversely affected 

risks and uncertainties associated with our expansion into and our operations in asia europe south america and other foreign markets could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

net external sales of our consolidated foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately 206  230 and 198 of our total consolidated net sales in 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively sales outside of the united states make up a significant part of our current business and future strategic plans our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition could be adversely affected by a variety of domestic and international factors including general economic conditions political instability inflation rates recessions tariffs foreign currency exchange rates foreign currency exchange controls interest rates foreign investment and repatriation restrictions legal and regulatory constraints civil unrest difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and other external economic and political factors in addition public health crises including viral outbreaks such as the coronavirus in foreign jurisdictions may temporarily reduce the demand for some of our products and adversely affect the availability and cost of raw materials our inability to successfully manage the risks and uncertainties relating to any of these factors could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

in many foreign countries it is acceptable to engage in certain business practices we are prohibited from engaging in because of regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act recent years have seen a substantial increase in antibribery law enforcement activity with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both us and nonus regulators and an increase in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals although we have internal control policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these regulations there can be no assurance our policies and procedures will prevent a violation of these regulations any violation could cause an adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

policy changes affecting international trade could adversely impact the demand for our products and our competitive position 

due to the international scope of our operations changes in government policies on foreign trade and investment may affect the demand for our products and services impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries our business benefits from free trade agreements which may include the united statesmexicocanada agreement and efforts to withdraw from or substantially modify such agreements in addition to the implementation of more restrictive trade policies such as more detailed inspections higher tariffs import or export licensing requirements exchange controls or new barriers to entry could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or cash flow and that of our customers vendors and suppliers 

additionally the results of the united kingdom’s referendum on european union membership which resulted in the united kingdoms exit from the european union on january 31 2020 has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in global stock markets currency exchange rate fluctuations and global economic uncertainty although it is unknown what the terms of the united kingdom’s future relationship with the european union will be it is possible there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the united kingdom and the european union and increased regulatory complexities any of these factors could adversely impact customer demand our relationships with customers and suppliers and our results of operations 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

because of our international operations we are exposed to risk associated with interest rates and value changes in foreign currencies which may adversely affect our business historically our reported net sales earnings cash flow and financial condition have been subjected to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates our primary exchange rate exposure is with the euro the chinese yuan the brazilian real the canadian dollar the british pound the mexican peso the australian dollar and the argentine peso each against the us dollar while we actively manage the exposure of our foreign currency risk as part of our overall financial risk management policy we believe we may experience losses from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and such losses could adversely affect our sales earnings cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we are subject to a wide variety of complex domestic and foreign laws rules and regulations for which compliance could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

we are subject to a wide variety of complex domestic and foreign laws rules and regulations and legal compliance risks including securities laws tax laws employment and pensionrelated laws competition laws us and foreign export and trading laws data 

privacy and security laws and laws governing improper business practices we are affected by new laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations including interpretations by courts and regulators from time to time our company our operations and the industries in which we operate are being reviewed or investigated by regulators which could lead to enforcement actions or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages 

although we believe we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to mitigate these risks the global and diverse nature of our operations means compliance risks will continue to exist investigations examinations and other proceedings the nature and outcome of which cannot be predicted will likely arise from time to time these investigations examinations and other proceedings could subject us to significant liability and require us to take significant accruals or pay significant settlements fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

we are subject to tax laws and regulations in the united states and multiple foreign jurisdictions we are affected by changes in tax laws and regulations as well as changes in related interpretations and other tax guidance in the ordinary course of our business we are subject to examinations and investigations by various tax authorities and other regulators in addition to existing examinations and investigations there could be additional examinations and investigations in the future and existing examinations and investigations could be expanded 

for nonincome tax risks we estimate material loss contingencies and accrue for such loss contingencies as required by us generally accepted accounting principles based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency in the event the loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently accrued the recording of the additional liability may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such additional liability is accrued in those cases where no accrual is recorded because it is not probable a liability has been incurred and cannot be reasonably estimated any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued or paid for income tax risks we recognize tax benefits based on our assessment that a tax benefit has a greater than 50 likelihood of being sustained upon ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant facts for those income tax positions where we determine there is not a greater than 50 likelihood such tax benefits will be sustained we do not recognize a tax benefit in our financial statements subsequent events may cause us to change our assessment of the likelihood of sustaining a previouslyrecognized benefit which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial position for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued or paid 

we discuss risks and uncertainties with regard to taxes in more detail in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

adverse weather conditions or impacts of climate change and natural disasters may temporarily reduce the demand for some of our products and could have a negative effect on our sales earnings or cash flow 

our business is seasonal in nature with the second and third quarters typically generating a higher proportion of sales and earnings than other quarters from time to time adverse weather conditions or impacts of climate change and natural disasters have had or may have an adverse effect on our sales of paint coatings and related products in addition unusually cold and rainy weather could have an adverse effect on sales of our exterior paint products an adverse effect on sales may cause a reduction in our earnings or cash flow 

inability to protect or enforce our material trademarks and other intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our business 

we have numerous patents trade secrets trademarks trade names and knowhow that are valuable to our business despite our efforts to protect such intellectual property and other proprietary information from unauthorized use or disclosure third parties may attempt to disclose obtain or use our trademarks or such other intellectual property and information without our authorization although we rely on the patent trademark trade secret and copyright laws of the united states and other countries to protect our intellectual property rights the laws of some countries may not protect such rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties the failure of foreign countries to have laws to protect our intellectual property rights or an inability to effectively enforce such rights in foreign countries could have an adverse effect on our business 

security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations compromise our information and the information of our customers and suppliers and severely harm our business 

as part of our business we collect process and retain sensitive and confidential personal information about our customers employees and suppliers despite the security measures we have in place our facilities and systems and those of the retailers dealers licensees and other thirdparty suppliers and vendors with which we do business may be vulnerable to security breaches 

cyber attacks acts of vandalism or misconduct computer viruses ransomware misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors or other similar events or intrusions any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer employee supplier or company information whether caused by us an unknown third party or the retailers dealers licensees or other thirdparty suppliers and vendors with which we do business could result in losses severely damage our reputation expose us to the risks of litigation and liability disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition as cyber security threats evolve in sophistication and become more prevalent in numerous industries worldwide we continue to increase our sensitivity and attention to these threats seek additional investments and resources to address these threats and enhance the security of our facilities and systems and strengthen our controls and procedures implemented to monitor and mitigate these threats the domestic and international regulatory environment related to information security data collection and privacy is increasingly rigorous and complex with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business compliance with these requirements including the european unions general data protection regulation and other domestic and international regulations could result in additional costs and changes to our business practices 

moreover we rely heavily on computer systems to manage and operate our business record and process transactions and manage support and communicate with our employees customers suppliers and other vendors computer systems are important to production planning manufacturing finance company operations and customer service among other businesscritical processes despite efforts to prevent disruptions to our computer systems our systems may be affected by damage or interruption from among other causes power outages system failures computer viruses and other intrusions including ransomware and other cyber attacks computer hardware and storage equipment that is integral to efficient operations such as email telephone and other functionality is concentrated in certain physical locations in the various continents in which we operate additionally we rely on software applications enterprise cloud storage systems and cloud computing services provided by thirdparty vendors if these thirdparty vendors as well as our suppliers and other vendors experience security breaches cyber attacks computer viruses ransomware or other similar events or intrusions our business may be adversely affected and such events or intrusions may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are required to comply with numerous complex and increasingly stringent domestic and foreign health safety and environmental laws and regulations the cost of which is likely to increase and may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

our operations are subject to various domestic and foreign health safety and environmental laws and regulations including laws and regulations related to climate change these laws and regulations not only govern our current operations and products but also impose potential liability on us for our past operations we expect health safety and environmental laws and regulations to impose increasingly stringent requirements upon our industry and us in the future our costs to comply with these laws and regulations may increase as these requirements become more stringent in the future and these increased costs may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

we are involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of our currently and formerly owned sites as well as a number of thirdparty sites for which our ultimate liability may exceed the current amount we have accrued 

we are involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of our currently and formerly owned sites and a number of thirdparty sites we accrue for estimated costs of investigation and remediation activities at these sites for which commitments or cleanup plans have been developed and when such costs can be reasonably estimated based on industry standards and professional judgment these estimated costs are based on currently available facts regarding each site we continuously assess our potential liability for investigation and remediation activities and adjust our environmentalrelated accruals as information becomes available upon which more accurate costs can be reasonably estimated due to the uncertainties surrounding environmental investigation and remediation activities our liability may result in costs that are significantly higher than currently accrued and may have an adverse effect on our earnings we discuss these risks and uncertainties in more detail in the environmental matters and environmentalrelated liabilities sections in item 7 and in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 

the nature cost quantity and outcome of pending and future litigation such as litigation arising from the historical manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paint could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity and financial condition 

in the course of our business we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits including but not limited to litigation relating to product liability and warranty personal injury environmental intellectual property commercial contractual and antitrust claims that are inherently subject to many uncertainties regarding the possibility of a loss to us these uncertainties will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur confirming the incurrence of a liability or the reduction of a liability in accordance with the contingencies topic of the asc we accrue for these contingencies by a charge to income when it is both probable that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact of a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated in the event a loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently accrued the recording 

of the additional liability may result in a material impact on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such additional liability is accrued in those cases where no accrual is recorded because it is not probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of any such loss cannot be reasonably estimated any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us may result in a material impact on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued 

our past operations included the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paints along with other companies we are and have been a defendant in a number of legal proceedings including individual personal injury actions purported class actions and actions brought by various counties cities school districts and other governmentrelated entities arising from the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paints the plaintiffs claims have been based upon various legal theories including negligence strict liability breach of warranty negligent misrepresentations and omissions fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions concert of action civil conspiracy violations of unfair trade practice and consumer protection laws enterprise liability market share liability public nuisance unjust enrichment and other theories the plaintiffs seek various damages and relief including personal injury and property damage costs relating to the detection and abatement of leadbased paint from buildings costs associated with a public education campaign medical monitoring costs and others we have also been a defendant in legal proceedings arising from the manufacture and sale of nonleadbased paints that seek recovery based upon various legal theories including the failure to adequately warn of potential exposure to lead during surface preparation when using nonleadbased paint on surfaces previously painted with leadbased paint we believe the litigation brought to date is without merit or subject to meritorious defenses and are vigorously defending such litigation we have not settled any material lead pigment or leadbased paint litigation we expect additional lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation may be filed against us in the future asserting similar or different legal theories and seeking similar or different types of damages and relief 

notwithstanding our views on the merits litigation is inherently subject to many uncertainties and we ultimately may not prevail adverse court rulings or determinations of liability among other factors could affect the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation against us and encourage an increase in the number and nature of future claims and proceedings in addition from time to time various legislation and administrative regulations have been enacted promulgated or proposed to impose obligations on present and former manufacturers of lead pigments and leadbased paints respecting asserted health concerns associated with such products or to overturn the effect of court decisions in which we and other manufacturers have been successful 

due to the uncertainties involved management is unable to predict the outcome of the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation the number or nature of possible future claims and proceedings or the effect any legislation andor administrative regulations may have on the litigation or against us in addition management cannot reasonably determine the scope or amount of the potential costs and liabilities related to such litigation or resulting from any such legislation and regulations except with respect to the litigation in california we have not accrued any amounts for such litigation because we do not believe it is probable that a loss has occurred and we believe it is not possible to estimate the range of potential losses as there is no substantive information upon which an estimate could be based in addition any potential liability that may result from any changes to legislation and regulations cannot reasonably be estimated in the event any significant liability is determined to be attributable to us relating to such litigation or any such liability is higher than any amount currently accrued for such litigation the recording of the liability or additional liability as applicable may result in a material impact on net income for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued additionally due to the uncertainties associated with the amount of any such liability andor the nature of any other remedy which may be imposed in such litigation any potential liability determined to be attributable to us arising out of such litigation may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition we discuss the risks and uncertainties related to litigation including the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation in more detail in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8

the effective income tax rate for 2019 was 222 compared to 185 in 2018  the increase in the effective rate in 2019 was primarily due to a 743 million tax credit investment loss recognized during the second quarter of 2019 related to the reversal of net tax benefits recognized in previous tax years from federal renewable energy tax credit funds this loss negatively impacted the 2019 effective tax rate by 370 basis points see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information

in 2018 the company terminated its domestic defined benefit pension plan for salaried employees terminated plan and the participants were moved to a qualified replacement plan qualified replacement plan which is the companys domestic defined contribution plan the company settled the liabilities of the terminated plan through a combination of i lump sum payments to eligible participants who elected to receive them and ii the purchase of annuity contracts for participants who either did not elect lump sums or were already receiving benefit payments the lump sum payments were paid in december 2018 and resulted in a settlement charge of 376 million in 2018 during the first quarter of 2019 the company purchased annuity contracts to settle the remaining liabilities of the terminated plan the annuity contract purchase resulted in a settlement charge of 324 million in the first quarter of 2019 the remaining surplus of the terminated plan is being used as prescribed in the applicable regulations to fund company contributions to the qualified replacement plan during 2019 the company transferred the remaining surplus of 2422 million to a suspense account held within a trust for the qualified replacement plan this amount included 1318 million of company common stock  300000 shares the shares are treated as treasury stock in accordance with asc 715 the companys domestic defined benefit pension plan for hourly employees continues to operate 

in accordance with the accounting prescribed by the retirement benefits topic of the asc the company’s total liability for unfunded or underfunded defined benefit pension plans increased 120 million to 927 million primarily due to changes in the 

actuarial assumptions postretirement benefits other than pensions increased 59 million to 2805 million at december 31 2019 due primarily to changes in the actuarial assumptions 

the assumed discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation for domestic defined benefit pension plans was 34 at december 31 2019 and 36 at december 31 2018 and 2017 the assumed discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation for foreign defined benefit pension plans decreased to 22 at december 31 2019 from 30 at december 31 2018  the decrease in the discount rates for both the domestic and foreign defined benefit pension plans was primarily due to lower interest rates the assumed discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation for other postretirement benefit obligations decreased to 32 at december 31 2019 from 42 at december 31 2018 for the same reason the rate of compensation increases used to determine the projected benefit obligations at december 31 2019 was 30 for the domestic pension plan and 31 for foreign pension plans which was comparable to the rates used in the prior year in deciding on the rate of compensation increases management considered historical company increases as well as expectations for future increases the expected longterm rate of return on assets remained 50 at december 31 2019 for the domestic pension plan and was slightly lower for most foreign plans in establishing the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for 2019  management considered the historical rates of return the nature of investments and an expectation for future investment strategies the assumed health care cost trend rates used to determine the net periodic benefit cost of postretirement benefits other than pensions for 2019 were 49 and 98  respectively for medical and prescription drug cost increases both decreasing gradually to 45 in 2026  in developing the assumed health care cost trend rates management considered industry data historical company experience and expectations for future health care costs 

for 2020 net pension cost for the ongoing domestic pension plan the company will use a discount rate of 34  an expected longterm rate of return on assets of 50 and a rate of compensation increase of 30  lower discount rates and expected longterm rates of return on plan assets will be used for most foreign plans for 2020  net periodic benefit costs for postretirement benefits other than pensions the company will use a discount rate of 32  net pension cost in 2020 for the ongoing domestic pension plan is expected to be approximately 28 million  net periodic benefit costs for postretirement benefits other than pensions in 2020 is expected to be approximately 100 million  see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for more information on the company’s obligations and funded status of its defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefits other than pensions 

deferred income taxes 

deferred income taxes at december 31 2019 decreased 1610 million from the prior year primarily due to the change in deferred taxes as a result of the amortization of intangible assets and settlement of the domestic defined benefit pension plan in the current year see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for more information on deferred taxes 

other longterm liabilities 

other longterm liabilities increased 1874 million during 2019 due primarily to the final court approved agreement to resolve the california public nuisance litigation which impacted the timing and amount of expected payments and an increase related to the reversal of net tax benefits recognized in previous tax years from federal renewable energy tax credit funds see notes 10 and 11  and 19 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for additional information on litigation and income tax matters respectively 

environmentalrelated liabilities 

the operations of the company like those of other companies in the same industry are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations these laws and regulations not only govern current operations and products but also impose potential liability on the company for past operations management expects environmental laws and regulations to impose increasingly stringent requirements upon the company and the industry in the future management believes that the company conducts its operations in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and has implemented various programs designed to protect the environment and promote continued compliance 

depreciation of capital expenditures and other expenses related to ongoing environmental compliance measures were included in the normal operating expenses of conducting business the company’s capital expenditures depreciation and other expenses related to ongoing environmental compliance measures were not material to the company’s financial condition liquidity cash flow or results of operations during 2019  management does not expect that such capital expenditures depreciation and other expenses will be material to the company’s financial condition liquidity cash flow or results of operations in 2020  see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for further information on environmentalrelated longterm liabilities

warranty accruals acquired in connection with the valspar acquisition in 2017 include warranties for certain products under extended furniture protection plans the decrease in the accrual in 2018 was primarily due to the divestiture of the furniture protection plan business during the third quarter of 2018 for an immaterial amount that approximated net book value 

shareholders’ equity 

shareholders’ equity increased 3926 million to 4123 billion at december 31 2019 from 3731 billion last year primarily due to an increase in retained earnings of 1120 billion and an increase in other capital of 2566 million  partially offset by purchases of treasury stock and treasury stock received from stock option exercises totaling 9358 million and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss of 496 million  retained earnings increased 1120 billion during 2019 due to net income of 1541 billion  partially offset by 4208 million in cash dividends paid the increase in other capital of 2566 million was due primarily to the recognition of stockbased compensation expense and stock option exercises the increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss of 496 million was due primarily to unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of 498 million  see the statements of consolidated shareholders equity and statements of consolidated comprehensive income in item 8 for additional information

cash flow 

net operating cash increased 3776 million in 2019 to a cash source of 2321 billion from a cash source of 1944 billion in 2018 due primarily to an increase in net income and favorable changes in noncash items partially offset by changes in working capital when compared to 2018  net operating cash increased as a percent to sales to 130 in 2019 compared to 111 in 2018  during 2019  strong net operating cash continued to provide the funds necessary to pay down total net debt invest in new stores and manufacturing and distribution facilities and return cash to shareholders through treasury stock purchases and dividends paid

litigation 

see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for information concerning litigation 

market risk 

the company is exposed to market risk associated with interest rate foreign currency and commodity fluctuations the company occasionally utilizes derivative instruments as part of its overall financial risk management policy but does not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes the company entered into foreign currency forward contracts with maturity dates of less than twelve months in 2019  2018 and 2017  primarily to hedge against value changes in foreign currency there were no material foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  in may 2019 the company entered into a us dollar to euro cross currency swap contract with a total notional amount of 4000 million to hedge the companys net investment in its european operations this contract has been designated as a net investment hedge and will mature on january 15 2022 during the term of the contract the company will pay fixedrate interest in euros and receive fixedrate interest in us dollars thereby effectively converting a portion of the companys us dollar denominated fixedrate debt to euro denominated fixedrate debt the company believes it may be exposed to continuing market risk from foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations however the company does not expect that foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations or hedging contract losses will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows see notes 1 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements these determinations were made based upon management’s best estimates judgments and assumptions that were believed to be reasonable under the circumstances giving due consideration to materiality we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions related to the accounting policies described below however application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and as a result actual results could differ from these estimates 

all of the significant accounting policies that were followed in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 management believes that the following critical accounting policies and estimates have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

inventories 

inventories were stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost determined principally on the lastin firstout lifo method based on inventory quantities and costs determined during the fourth quarter inventory quantities were adjusted during the fourth quarter as a result of annual physical inventory counts taken at all locations if inventories accounted for on the lifo method are reduced on a yearoveryear basis then liquidation of certain quantities carried at costs prevailing in prior years occurs management recorded the best estimate of net realizable value for obsolete and discontinued inventories based on historical experience and current trends through reductions to inventory cost by recording a provision included in cost of goods sold if management estimates that the reasonable market value is below cost or determines that future demand was lower than current inventory levels based on historical experience current and projected market demand current and projected volume trends and other relevant current and projected factors associated with the current economic conditions a reduction in inventory cost to estimated net realizable value is provided for in the reserve for obsolescence see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for more information regarding the impact of the lifo inventory valuation and the reserve for obsolescence 

goodwill and intangible assets 

in accordance with the goodwill and other intangibles topic of the asc management performs impairment tests of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets on an annual basis as well as whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate impairment has more likely than not occurred an optional qualitative assessment allows companies to skip the annual quantitative test if it is not more likely than not that impairment has occurred based on monitoring key company financial performance metrics and macroeconomic conditions the qualitative assessment is performed when deemed appropriate 

in accordance with the goodwill and other intangibles topic of the asc management tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level a reporting unit is an operating segment per the segment reporting topic of the asc or one level below the operating segment component level as determined by the availability of discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed by operating segment management or an aggregate of component levels of an operating segment having similar economic characteristics at the time of goodwill impairment testing if performing a quantitative assessment management determines fair value through the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved for each reporting unit if the calculated fair value is less than the current carrying value then impairment of the reporting unit exists the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model to determine estimated fair value is common practice in impairment testing the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model for impairment testing include discount rates growth rates cash flow projections and terminal value rates discount rates are set by using the weighted average cost of capital “wacc” methodology the wacc methodology considers market and industry data as well as companyspecific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rates to be used the discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business operational management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates sales projections and cash flow projections for each reporting unit terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates as an indicator that each reporting unit has been valued appropriately through the use of the discounted cash flow valuation model the aggregate of all reporting units fair value is reconciled to the total market capitalization of the company 

the company had seven components some of which are aggregated due to similar economic characteristics to form three reporting units also the operating segments with goodwill as of october 1 2019  the date of the annual impairment test the annual impairment review performed as of october 1 2019 did not result in any of the reporting units having impairment or deemed at risk for impairment 

in accordance with the goodwill and other intangibles topic of the asc management tests indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at the asset level as determined by appropriate asset valuations at acquisition management utilizes the royalty savings method and valuation model to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinitelived intangible asset or trademark in this method management estimates the royalty savings arising from the ownership of the intangible asset the key assumptions used in estimating the royalty savings for impairment testing include discount rates royalty rates growth rates sales projections terminal value rates and to a lesser extent tax rates discount rates used are similar to the rates developed by the wacc methodology considering any differences in companyspecific risk factors between reporting units and trademarks royalty rates are established by management and valuation experts and periodically substantiated by valuation experts operational management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates and sales projections for each significant trademark terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual sales estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates the royalty savings valuation methodology and calculations used in 2019 impairment testing are consistent with prior years the annual impairment review performed as of october 1 2019 resulted in the company recognizing noncash pretax impairment charges totaling 1221 million related to certain recently acquired indefinitelived trademarks 

the discounted cash flow and royalty savings valuation methodologies require management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the valuations are performed actual results could differ from these assumptions management believes the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value considering the current economic conditions see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of goodwill and intangible assets and the impairment tests performed in accordance with the goodwill and other intangibles topic of the asc 

valuation of longlived assets 

in accordance with the property plant and equipment topic of the asc if events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying value of longlived assets including operating lease rightofuse assets may not be recoverable or the useful life had changed impairment tests were performed or the useful life was adjusted undiscounted cash flows were used to calculate the recoverable value of longlived assets to determine if such assets were not recoverable if the carrying value of the assets was deemed to not be recoverable the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets as determined in accordance with the fair value topic of the asc if the usefulness of an asset was determined to be impaired then management estimated a new useful life based on the period of time for projected uses of the asset fair value approaches and changes in useful life required management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the valuation or determination was performed actual results could differ from these assumptions management believes the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value or useful life considering the current economic conditions all tested longlived assets or groups of longlived assets had undiscounted cash flows that were substantially in excess of their carrying value see notes 4 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of the reductions in carrying value or useful life of longlived assets in accordance with the property plant and equipment topic of the asc see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for the property plant and equipment accounting policy 

defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

to determine the company’s ultimate obligation under its defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans other than pensions management must estimate the future cost of benefits and attribute that cost to the time period during which each covered employee works to determine the obligations of such benefit plans management uses actuaries to calculate such amounts using key assumptions such as discount rates inflation longterm investment returns mortality employee turnover rate of compensation increases and medical and prescription drug costs management reviews all of these assumptions on an ongoing basis to ensure that the most current information available is being considered an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside management’s control could have a direct impact on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

in accordance with the retirement benefits topic of the asc the company recognizes each plan’s funded status as an asset for overfunded plans and as a liability for unfunded or underfunded plans actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss a component of shareholders’ equity the amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss will continue to be modified as actuarial assumptions and service costs change and all such amounts will be amortized to expense over a period of years through the net pension and net periodic benefit costs 

pension costs for 2020 are expected to decrease significantly due to pension settlement lump sum activity in 2018 and annuity contract purchases in the first quarter of 2019 the annuity contract purchases in 2019 resulted in a settlement charge of 324 million  the company will use any remaining overfunded cash surplus balances as prescribed in the applicable regulations to fund future company contributions to a qualified replacement pension plan which is the current domestic defined contribution plan qualified replacement plan postretirement benefit plan costs for 2020 are expected to be approximately the same as 2019 due to similar actuarial assumptions being applied see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for information concerning the company’s defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans other than pensions 

environmental matters 

the company is involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of its currently and formerly owned sites including sites which were previously owned andor operated by businesses acquired by the company the company initially provides for estimated costs of environmentalrelated activities relating to its past operations and thirdparty sites for which commitments or cleanup plans have been developed and when such costs can be reasonably estimated based on industry standards and professional judgment these estimated costs which are not discounted are determined based on currently available facts regarding each site if the reasonably estimable costs can only be identified as a range and no specific amount within that range can be determined more likely than any other amount within the range the minimum of the range is provided the company continuously assesses its potential liability for investigation and remediationrelated activities and adjusts its environmentalrelated accruals as information becomes available upon which more accurate costs can be reasonably estimated and as additional accounting guidelines are issued actual costs incurred may vary from the accrued estimates due to the inherent uncertainties involved see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for information concerning the accrual for extended environmentalrelated activities and a discussion concerning unaccrued future loss contingencies 

litigation and other contingent liabilities 

in the course of its business the company is subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits including but not limited to litigation relating to product liability and warranty personal injury environmental intellectual property commercial contractual and antitrust claims management believes that the company has properly accrued for all known liabilities that existed and those where a loss was deemed probable for which a fair value was available or an amount could be reasonably estimated in accordance with us gaap however because litigation is inherently subject to many uncertainties and the ultimate result of any present or future litigation is unpredictable the company’s ultimate liability may result in costs that are significantly higher than currently accrued in the event that the company’s loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently accrued the recording of the liability may result in a material impact on net income for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued additionally due to the uncertainties involved any potential liability determined to be attributable to the company arising out of such litigation may have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations liquidity or financial condition see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for information concerning litigation 

income taxes 

the company estimated income taxes in each jurisdiction that it operated this involved estimating taxable earnings specific taxable and deductible items the likelihood of generating sufficient future taxable income to utilize deferred tax assets and possible exposures related to future tax audits to the extent these estimates change adjustments to deferred and accrued income taxes will be made in the period in which the changes occur 

we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution these assessments of uncertain tax positions contain judgments related to the interpretation of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we transact business the judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits expiration of statutes of limitations as well as changes to or further interpretations of tax laws and regulations income tax expense is adjusted in our statements of consolidated income in the period in which these events occur see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for information concerning income taxes 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk associated with interest rates foreign currency and commodity fluctuations we occasionally utilize derivative instruments as part of our overall financial risk management policy but do not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes in 2019 the company entered into a us dollar to euro cross currency swap contract to hedge the companys net investment in its european operations this contract has been designated as a net investment hedge and will mature on january 15 2022 see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 the company entered into forward foreign currency exchange contracts during 2019 to hedge against value changes in foreign currency there were no material contracts outstanding at december 31 2019  forward foreign currency exchange contracts are described in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 we believe we may experience continuing losses from foreign currency fluctuations however we do not expect currency translation transaction or hedging contract losses to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

business developments 

for additional information regarding our business and business developments see pages 8  through 15  of our 2018  annual report and the “letter to shareholders” on pages 2  through 7  of our 2018  annual report which is incorporated herein by reference 

raw materials and products purchased for resale 

we believe we generally have adequate sources of raw materials and fuel supplies used in our business there are sufficient suppliers of each product purchased for resale that none of the reportable segments anticipate any significant sourcing problems during 2019  see item 1a risk factors for more information regarding cost and sourcing of raw materials 

seasonality 

the majority of the sales for the reportable segments traditionally occur during the second and third quarters there is no significant seasonality in sales for the administrative segment 

working capital 

in order to meet increased demand during the second and third quarters the company usually builds its inventories during the first quarter working capital items inventories and accounts receivable are generally financed through shortterm borrowings which include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of commercial paper for a description of the company’s liquidity and capital resources see pages 25  through 30  of our 2018  annual report under the caption “financial condition liquidity and cash flow” of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” which is incorporated herein by reference 

trademarks and trade names 

customer recognition of our trademarks and trade names collectively contribute significantly to our sales the major trademarks and trade names used by each of the reportable segments are set forth below 

 patents 

although patents and licenses are not of material importance to our business as a whole or any segment the americas group and the performance coatings group derive a portion of their income from the licensing of technology trademarks and trade names to foreign companies 

backlog and productive capacity 

backlog orders are not significant in the business of any reportable segment since there is normally a short period of time between the placing of an order and shipment we believe that sufficient productive capacity currently exists to fulfill our needs for paint coatings and related products through 2019  

competition 

we experience competition from many local regional national and international competitors of various sizes in the manufacture distribution and sale of our paint coatings and related products we are a leading manufacturer and retailer of paint coatings and related products to professional industrial commercial and retail customers however our competitive position varies for our different products and markets 

in the americas group competitors include other paint and wallpaper stores mass merchandisers home centers independent hardware stores hardware chains and manufactureroperated direct outlets product quality product innovation breadth of product line technical expertise service and price determine the competitive advantage for this segment 

in the consumer brands group domestic and foreign competitors include manufacturers and distributors of branded and privatelabel paint and coatings products technology product quality product innovation breadth of product line technical expertise distribution service and price are the key competitive factors for this segment 

the performance coatings group has numerous competitors in its domestic and foreign markets with broad product offerings and several others with niche products key competitive factors for this segment include technology product quality product innovation breadth of product line technical expertise distribution service and price 

the administrative segment has many competitors consisting of other real estate owners developers and managers in areas in which this segment owns property the main competitive factors are the availability of property and price 

employees 

we employed 53368 persons at december 31 2018

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks described below and in other documents we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

adverse changes in general business and economic conditions in the united states and worldwide may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

our business is sensitive to global and regional business and economic conditions adverse changes in such conditions in the united states and worldwide may reduce the demand for some of our products and impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us each of which could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition higher inflation rates interest rates tax rates and unemployment rates higher labor and healthcare costs recessions changing governmental policies laws and regulations and other economic factors could also adversely affect demand for some of our products and our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition and that of our customers vendors and suppliers 

a weakening or reversal of the general economic recovery in the united states and other countries and regions in which we do business or the continuation or worsening of economic downturns in other countries and regions may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

global economic uncertainty continues to exist a weakening or reversal of the general economic recovery in the united states and other countries and regions in which we do business or the continuation or worsening of economic downturns in other countries and regions may adversely impact our net sales the collection of accounts receivable funding for working capital needs expected cash flow generation from current and acquired businesses and our investments which may adversely impact our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we finance a portion of our sales through trade credit credit markets remain tight and some customers who require financing for their businesses have not been able to obtain necessary financing a continuation or worsening of these conditions could limit our ability to collect our accounts receivable which could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we generally fund a portion of our seasonal working capital needs and obtain funding for other general corporate purposes through shortterm borrowings backed by our revolving credit facility and other financing facilities if any of the banks in these credit and financing facilities are unable to perform on their commitments such inability could adversely impact our cash flow liquidity or financial condition including our ability to obtain funding for working capital needs and other general corporate purposes 

although we currently have available credit facilities to fund our current operating needs we cannot be certain we will be able to replace our existing credit facilities or refinance our existing or future debt when necessary our cost of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by our debt and credit ratings assigned by the major credit rating agencies downgrades in these ratings will increase our cost of borrowing and could have an adverse effect on our access to the capital markets including our access to the commercial paper market an inability to access the capital markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we have goodwill and intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet we periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such value may not be recoverable an impairment assessment involves judgment as to assumptions regarding future sales and cash flow and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions future events and changing market conditions may impact our assumptions and change our estimates of future sales and cash flow resulting in us incurring substantial impairment charges which would adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

we hold investments in equity and debt securities in some of our defined benefit pension plans a decrease in the value of plan assets resulting from a general financial downturn may cause a negative pension plan investment performance which may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

protracted duration of economic downturns in cyclical segments of the economy may depress the demand for some of our products and adversely affect our sales earnings cash flow or financial condition 

portions of our business involve the sale of paint coatings and related products to segments of the economy that are cyclical in nature particularly segments relating to construction housing manufacturing and oil production refining storage and transportation our sales to these segments are affected by the levels of discretionary consumer and business spending in these segments during economic downturns in these segments the levels of consumer and business discretionary spending may decrease and the recovery of these segments may lag behind the recovery of the overall economy this decrease in spending will likely reduce the demand for some of our products and may adversely affect our sales earnings cash flow or financial condition 

throughout 2018 interest rates including mortgage rates rose and may continue to rise in 2019  although interest rates remain low by historical standards this increase may adversely affect the demand for new residential homes existing home turnover and new nonresidential construction challenging market conditions are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and may worsen a worsening in these segments will reduce the demand for some of our products and may adversely impact sales earnings and cash flow 

in the us construction and housing segments the recent demand for new construction has caused contractors to experience a shortage of skilled workers resulting in project backlogs and an adverse effect on the growth rate of demand for our products while we expect to see higher demand for our products as project backlogs are reduced in the future this labor shortage may adversely impact our sales earnings cash flow or financial condition 

increases in the cost of raw materials and energy may adversely affect our earnings or cash flow 

we purchase raw materials including titanium dioxide and petrochemical feedstock sources such as propylene and ethylene and energy for use in the manufacturing distribution and sale of our products factors such as political instability higher tariffs and adverse weather conditions including hurricanes and other natural disasters can disrupt raw material and fuel supplies and increase our costs although raw materials and energy supplies including oil and natural gas are generally available from various sources in sufficient quantities unexpected shortages and increases in the cost of raw materials and energy or any deterioration in our relationships with or the financial viability of our suppliers may have an adverse effect on our earnings or cash flow in the event we are unable to offset higher costs in a timely manner by sufficiently decreasing our operating costs or raising the prices of our products in recent years some raw material and energy prices have increased particularly titanium dioxide and petrochemical feedstock sources such as propylene and ethylene as well as metal and plastic packaging the cost of raw materials and energy has in the past experienced and likely will in the future continue to experience periods of volatility 

although we have an extensive customer base the loss of any of our largest customers could adversely affect our sales earnings or cash flow 

we have a large and varied customer base due to our extensive distribution network during 2018  no individual customer accounted for sales totaling more than ten percent of our sales however we have some customers that individually purchase a large amount of products from us although our broad distribution channels help to minimize the impact of the loss of any one customer the loss of any of these large customers could have an adverse effect on our sales earnings or cash flow 

increased competition may reduce our sales earnings or cash flow performance 

we face substantial competition from many international national regional and local competitors of various sizes in the manufacture distribution and sale of our paint coatings and related products some of our competitors are larger than us and have greater financial resources to compete other competitors are smaller and may be able to offer more specialized products technology product quality product innovation breadth of product line technical expertise distribution service and price are the key competitive factors for our business competition in any of these areas may reduce our sales and adversely affect our earnings or cash flow by resulting in decreased sales volumes reduced prices and increased costs of manufacturing distributing and selling our products 

we may not realize the growth opportunities and cost synergies that are anticipated from the acquisition of valspar 

the benefits that are expected to result from the acquisition of valspar will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities and additional cost synergies as a result of the acquisition our success in realizing these growth opportunities and additional cost synergies and the timing of this realization depends on the successful integration of valspar there is a significant degree of difficulty and management distraction inherent in the process of integrating an acquisition as sizable as valspar the process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in our activities members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process which will decrease the time available to manage our company service existing customers attract new customers and 

develop new products or strategies if senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration process or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process our business could suffer there can be no assurance we will successfully or costeffectively integrate valspar the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

even if we are able to integrate valspar successfully this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the growth opportunities and additional cost synergies we currently expect from this integration we also cannot guarantee these benefits will be achieved within anticipated time frames or at all for example we may not be able to eliminate all duplicative costs and we may incur substantial unanticipated expenses in connection with the valspar integration while we expect certain expenses will be incurred to achieve cost synergies such expenses are difficult to estimate accurately and may exceed current estimates accordingly the benefits from the acquisition may be offset by costs incurred to or delays in integrating the businesses 

we require a significant amount of cash to service the substantial amount of debt we have outstanding our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control we also depend on the business of our subsidiaries to satisfy our cash needs if we cannot generate the required cash we may not be able to make the necessary payments required under our indebtedness 

at december 31 2018  we had total debt of approximately 93 billion  which is a decrease  of 12 billion   since december 31 2017  and includes indebtedness incurred to complete the valspar acquisition we have the ability under our existing credit facilities to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future our ability to make payments on our debt fund our other liquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future our historical financial results have been and we anticipate our future financial results will be subject to fluctuations our ability to generate cash to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control we cannot guarantee our business will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make payments of our debt fund other liquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures 

the degree to which we are currently leveraged could have important consequences for shareholders for example it could 

 

additionally any failure to comply with covenants in the instruments governing our debt could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived would have a material adverse effect on us 

a significant portion of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries as a result our ability to generate sufficient cash flow for our needs is dependent to some extent on the earnings of our subsidiaries and the payment of those earnings to us in the form of dividends loans or advances and through repayment of loans or advances from us our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay any amounts due on our debt or to provide us with funds to meet our cash flow needs whether in the form of dividends distributions loans or other payments in addition any payment of dividends loans or advances by our subsidiaries could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions payments to us by our subsidiaries will also be contingent upon our subsidiaries’ earnings and business considerations our right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary’s creditors including trade creditors in addition even if we are a creditor of any of our subsidiaries our rights as a creditor would be subordinate to any security interest in the assets of our subsidiaries and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries senior to that held by us finally changes in the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may adversely affect the ability of some of our foreign subsidiaries to repatriate funds to us 

our results of operations cash flow or financial condition may be negatively impacted if we do not successfully integrate future acquisitions into our existing operations and if the performance of the businesses we acquire do not meet our expectations 

we have historically made strategic acquisitions of businesses in the paint and coatings industry and will likely acquire additional businesses in the future as part of our longterm growth strategy the success of future acquisitions depends in large part on our ability to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired companies and manage challenges that may arise as 

a result of the acquisitions particularly when the acquired businesses operate in new or foreign markets in the event we do not successfully integrate such future acquisitions into our existing operations so as to realize the expected return on our investment our results of operations cash flow or financial condition could be adversely affected 

risks and uncertainties associated with our expansion into and our operations in asia europe south america and other foreign markets could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

net external sales of our consolidated foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately 230  198  and 145  of our total consolidated net sales in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively sales outside of the united states make up a significant part of our current business and future strategic plans our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition could be adversely affected by a variety of domestic and international factors including general economic conditions political instability inflation rates recessions tariffs foreign currency exchange rates foreign currency exchange controls interest rates foreign investment and repatriation restrictions legal and regulatory constraints civil unrest difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and other external economic and political factors our inability to successfully manage the risks and uncertainties relating to these factors could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

in many foreign countries it is acceptable to engage in certain business practices we are prohibited from engaging in because of regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act recent years have seen a substantial increase in antibribery law enforcement activity with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both us and nonus regulators and an increase in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals although we have internal control policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these regulations there can be no assurance our policies and procedures will prevent a violation of these regulations any violation could cause an adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

policy changes affecting international trade could adversely impact the demand for our products and our competitive position 

due to the international scope of our operations changes in government policies on foreign trade and investment may affect the demand for our products and services impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries our business benefits from free trade agreements such as the north american free trade agreement and successor agreements which may include the united statesmexicocanada agreement and efforts to withdraw from or substantially modify such agreements in addition to the implementation of more restrictive trade policies such as more detailed inspections higher tariffs import or export licensing requirements exchange controls or new barriers to entry could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or cash flow and that of our customers vendors and suppliers 

additionally the results of the united kingdom’s referendum on european union membership advising for the exit from the european union has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in global stock markets currency exchange rate fluctuations and global economic uncertainty although it is unknown what the terms of the united kingdom’s future relationship with the european union will be it is possible there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the united kingdom and the european union and increased regulatory complexities any of these factors could adversely impact customer demand our relationships with customers and suppliers and our results of operations 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

because of our international operations we are exposed to risk associated with interest rates and value changes in foreign currencies which may adversely affect our business historically our reported net sales earnings cash flow and financial condition have been subjected to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates our primary exchange rate exposure is with the euro the chinese yuan the brazilian real the canadian dollar the british pound the mexican peso and the australian dollar each against the us dollar while we actively manage the exposure of our foreign currency risk as part of our overall financial risk management policy we believe we may experience losses from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and such losses could adversely affect our sales earnings cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we are subject to a wide variety of complex domestic and foreign laws rules and regulations for which compliance could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

we are subject to a wide variety of complex domestic and foreign laws rules and regulations and legal compliance risks including securities laws tax laws employment and pensionrelated laws competition laws us and foreign export and trading laws data privacy and security laws and laws governing improper business practices we are affected by new laws and 

regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations including interpretations by courts and regulators from time to time our company our operations and the industries in which we operate are being reviewed or investigated by regulators which could lead to enforcement actions or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages 

although we believe we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to mitigate these risks the global and diverse nature of our operations means compliance risks will continue to exist investigations examinations and other proceedings the nature and outcome of which cannot be predicted will likely arise from time to time these investigations examinations and other proceedings could subject us to significant liability and require us to take significant accruals or pay significant settlements fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

we are subject to tax laws and regulations in the united states and multiple foreign jurisdictions we are affected by changes in tax laws and regulations as well as changes in related interpretations and other tax guidance in the ordinary course of our business we are subject to examinations and investigations by various tax authorities and other regulators in addition to existing examinations and investigations there could be additional examinations and investigations in the future and existing examinations and investigations could be expanded 

on december 22 2017 us tax reform legislation known as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” was signed into law the tax act made substantial changes to thencurrent us tax law including a reduction in the corporate tax rate a limitation on deductibility of interest expense a limitation on the use of net operating losses to offset future taxable income the allowance of immediate expensing of capital expenditures deemed repatriation of foreign earnings and significant changes to the taxation of foreign earnings going forward the tax act contains numerous complex provisions impacting us multinational companies and we continue to review and assess the legislative language and guidance promulgated by regulators to determine the tax acts full impact on us the full extent of the impact remains uncertain at this time and our current interpretations of and assumptions regarding the tax act are subject to additional regulatory or administrative developments including any regulations or additional guidance promulgated by the us internal revenue service or other regulators further we can provide no assurance our current interpretations of and assumptions regarding the tax act and any related regulations or guidance will not be reviewed or investigated by regulators in the future as a result the tax act including any regulations or other guidance promulgated by the us internal revenue service or other regulators and other tax laws could have significant effects on us some of which could materially and adversely impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

for nonincome tax risks we estimate material loss contingencies and accrue for such loss contingencies as required by us generally accepted accounting principles based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency in the event the loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently accrued the recording of the additional liability may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such additional liability is accrued in those cases where no accrual is recorded because it is not probable a liability has been incurred and cannot be reasonably estimated any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued or paid for income tax risks we recognize tax benefits based on our assessment that a tax benefit has a greater than 50 likelihood of being sustained upon ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant facts for those income tax positions where we determine there is not a greater than 50 likelihood such tax benefits will be sustained we do not recognize a tax benefit in our financial statements subsequent events may cause us to change our assessment of the likelihood of sustaining a previouslyrecognized benefit which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial position for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued or paid 

we discuss risks and uncertainties with regard to taxes in more detail in note 15  of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 71  through 73  of our 2018  annual report 

adverse weather conditions and natural disasters may temporarily reduce the demand for some of our products and could have a negative effect on our sales earnings or cash flow 

our business is seasonal in nature with the second and third quarters typically generating a higher proportion of sales and earnings than other quarters from time to time adverse weather conditions and natural disasters have had an adverse effect on our sales of paint coatings and related products for example during 2018 the impact of hurricanes michael and florence on our operations in florida the carolinas and neighboring areas as well as the wildfires in california resulted in a temporary shutdown of some of our companyoperated paint stores manufacturing facilities andor distribution centers in the affected regions resulting in reduced revenues in addition unusually cold and rainy weather could have an adverse effect on sales of our exterior paint products an adverse effect on sales may cause a reduction in our earnings or cash flow 

inability to protect or enforce our material trademarks and other intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our business 

we have numerous patents trade secrets trademarks trade names and knowhow that are valuable to our business despite our efforts to protect such intellectual property and other proprietary information from unauthorized use or disclosure third parties may attempt to disclose obtain or use our trademarks or such other intellectual property and information without our authorization although we rely on the patent trademark trade secret and copyright laws of the united states and other countries to protect our intellectual property rights the laws of some countries may not protect such rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties the failure of foreign countries to have laws to protect our intellectual property rights or an inability to effectively enforce such rights in foreign countries could have an adverse effect on our business 

security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations compromise our information and the information of our customers and suppliers and severely harm our business 

as part of our business we collect process and retain sensitive and confidential personal information about our customers employees and suppliers despite the security measures we have in place our facilities and systems and those of the retailers dealers licensees and other thirdparty suppliers and vendors with which we do business may be vulnerable to security breaches cyber attacks acts of vandalism or misconduct computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors or other similar events any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer employee supplier or company information whether caused by us an unknown third party or the retailers dealers licensees or other thirdparty suppliers and vendors with which we do business could result in losses severely damage our reputation expose us to the risks of litigation and liability disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition as cyber security threats evolve in sophistication and become more prevalent in numerous industries worldwide we continue to increase our sensitivity and attention to these threats seek additional investments and resources to address these threats and enhance the security of our facilities and systems and strengthen our controls and procedures implemented to monitor and mitigate these threats the domestic and international regulatory environment related to information security data collection and privacy is increasingly rigorous and complex with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business compliance with these requirements including the european unions general data protection regulation and other domestic and international regulations could result in additional costs and changes to our business practices 

moreover we rely heavily on computer systems to manage and operate our business record and process transactions and manage support and communicate with our employees customers suppliers and other vendors computer systems are important to production planning finance company operations and customer service among other businesscritical processes despite efforts to prevent disruptions to our computer systems our systems may be affected by damage or interruption from among other causes power outages system failures computer viruses and other intrusions including cyber attacks computer hardware and storage equipment that is integral to efficient operations such as email telephone and other functionality is concentrated in certain physical locations in the various continents in which we operate additionally we rely on software applications enterprise cloud storage systems and cloud computing services provided by thirdparty vendors and our business may be adversely affected by service disruptions in or security breaches to such thirdparty systems 

we are required to comply with numerous complex and increasingly stringent domestic and foreign health safety and environmental laws and regulations the cost of which is likely to increase and may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

our operations are subject to various domestic and foreign health safety and environmental laws and regulations these laws and regulations not only govern our current operations and products but also impose potential liability on us for our past operations we expect health safety and environmental laws and regulations to impose increasingly stringent requirements upon our industry and us in the future our costs to comply with these laws and regulations may increase as these requirements become more stringent in the future and these increased costs may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

we are involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of our currently and formerly owned sites as well as a number of thirdparty sites for which our ultimate liability may exceed the current amount we have accrued 

we are involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of our currently and formerly owned sites and a number of thirdparty sites we accrue for estimated costs of investigation and remediation activities at these sites for which commitments or cleanup plans have been developed and when such costs can be reasonably estimated based on industry standards and professional judgment these estimated costs are based on currently available facts regarding each site 

we continuously assess our potential liability for investigation and remediation activities and adjust our environmentalrelated accruals as information becomes available upon which more accurate costs can be reasonably estimated due to the uncertainties surrounding environmental investigation and remediation activities our liability may result in costs that are significantly higher than currently accrued and may have an adverse effect on our earnings we discuss these risks and uncertainties in more detail on page 23  of our 2018  annual report under the caption “environmental matters” page 28  of our 2018  annual report under the caption “environmentalrelated liabilities” and in note 9  of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 62  through 63  of our 2018  annual report 

the nature cost quantity and outcome of pending and future litigation such as litigation arising from the historical manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paint could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity and financial condition 

in the course of our business we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits including but not limited to litigation relating to product liability and warranty personal injury environmental intellectual property commercial contractual and antitrust claims that are inherently subject to many uncertainties regarding the possibility of a loss to us these uncertainties will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur confirming the incurrence of a liability or the reduction of a liability in accordance with the contingencies topic of the asc we accrue for these contingencies by a charge to income when it is both probable that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact of a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated in the event a loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently accrued the recording of the additional liability may result in a material impact on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such additional liability is accrued in those cases where no accrual is recorded because it is not probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of any such loss cannot be reasonably estimated any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us may result in a material impact on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued 

our past operations included the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paints along with other companies we are and have been a defendant in a number of legal proceedings including individual personal injury actions purported class actions and actions brought by various counties cities school districts and other governmentrelated entities arising from the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paints the plaintiffs claims have been based upon various legal theories including negligence strict liability breach of warranty negligent misrepresentations and omissions fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions concert of action civil conspiracy violations of unfair trade practice and consumer protection laws enterprise liability market share liability public nuisance unjust enrichment and other theories the plaintiffs seek various damages and relief including personal injury and property damage costs relating to the detection and abatement of leadbased paint from buildings costs associated with a public education campaign medical monitoring costs and others we have also been a defendant in legal proceedings arising from the manufacture and sale of nonleadbased paints that seek recovery based upon various legal theories including the failure to adequately warn of potential exposure to lead during surface preparation when using nonleadbased paint on surfaces previously painted with leadbased paint we believe the litigation brought to date is without merit or subject to meritorious defenses and are vigorously defending such litigation we have not settled any material lead pigment or leadbased paint litigation we expect additional lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation may be filed against us in the future asserting similar or different legal theories and seeking similar or different types of damages and relief 

notwithstanding our views on the merits litigation is inherently subject to many uncertainties and we ultimately may not prevail adverse court rulings such as the courts decision in the santa clara county california proceeding the jury verdict against us and other defendants in the state of rhode island action and the wisconsin state supreme court’s determination that wisconsin’s risk contribution theory may apply in the lead pigment litigation or determinations of liability among other factors could affect the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation against us and encourage an increase in the number and nature of future claims and proceedings in addition from time to time various legislation and administrative regulations have been enacted promulgated or proposed to impose obligations on present and former manufacturers of lead pigments and leadbased paints respecting asserted health concerns associated with such products or to overturn the effect of court decisions in which we and other manufacturers have been successful 

due to the uncertainties involved management is unable to predict the outcome of the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation the number or nature of possible future claims and proceedings or the effect any legislation andor administrative regulations may have on the litigation or against us in addition management cannot reasonably determine the scope or amount of the potential costs and liabilities related to such litigation or resulting from any such legislation and regulations except with respect to the litigation in california we have not accrued any amounts for such litigation because we do not believe it is probable that a loss has occurred and we believe it is not possible to estimate the range of potential losses as there is no substantive information upon which an estimate could be based in addition any potential liability that may result from any changes to legislation and regulations cannot reasonably be estimated in the event any significant liability is determined to be attributable to us relating to such litigation or any such liability is higher than any amount currently accrued for such litigation 

the recording of the liability or additional liability as applicable may result in a material impact on net income for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued additionally due to the uncertainties associated with the amount of any such liability andor the nature of any other remedy which may be imposed in such litigation any potential liability determined to be attributable to us arising out of such litigation may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we discuss the risks and uncertainties related to litigation including the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation in more detail in note 10  of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 63  through 67  of our 2018  annual report

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks described below and in other documents that we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

adverse changes in general business and economic conditions in the united states and worldwide may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

our business is sensitive to global and regional business and economic conditions adverse changes in such conditions in the united states and worldwide may reduce the demand for some of our products and impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us each of which could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition higher inflation rates interest rates tax rates and unemployment rates higher labor and healthcare costs recessions changing governmental policies laws and regulations and other economic factors could also adversely affect demand for some of our products and our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition and that of our customers vendors and suppliers 

a weakening or reversal of the general economic recovery in the united states and other countries and regions in which we do business or the continuation or worsening of economic downturns in other countries and regions may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

global economic uncertainty continues to exist a weakening or reversal of the general economic recovery in the united states and other countries and regions in which we do business or the continuation or worsening of economic downturns in other countries and regions may adversely impact our net sales the collection of accounts receivable funding for working capital needs expected cash flow generation from current and acquired businesses and our investments which may adversely impact our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we finance a portion of our sales through trade credit credit markets remain tight and some customers who require financing for their businesses have not been able to obtain necessary financing a continuation or worsening of these conditions 

could limit our ability to collect our accounts receivable which could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we generally fund a portion of our seasonal working capital needs and obtain funding for other general corporate purposes through shortterm borrowings backed by our revolving credit facility and other financing facilities if any of the banks in these credit and financing facilities are unable to perform on their commitments which could adversely affect our ability to fund seasonal working capital needs and obtain funding for other general corporate purposes our cash flow liquidity or financial condition could be adversely impacted 

although we currently have available credit facilities to fund our current operating needs we cannot be certain that we will be able to replace our existing credit facilities or refinance our existing or future debt when necessary our cost of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by our debt and credit ratings assigned by the major credit rating agencies downgrades in these ratings will increase our cost of borrowing and could have an adverse effect on our access to the capital markets including our access to the commercial paper market an inability to access the capital markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we have goodwill and intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet we periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such value may not be recoverable an impairment assessment involves judgment as to assumptions regarding future sales and cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions future events and changing market conditions may impact our assumptions and may result in changes in our estimates of future sales and cash flows that may result in us incurring substantial impairment charges which would adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

we hold investments in equity and debt securities in some of our defined benefit pension plans a decrease in the value of plan assets resulting from a general financial downturn may cause a negative pension plan investment performance which may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

protracted duration of economic downturns in cyclical segments of the economy may depress the demand for some of our products and adversely affect our sales earnings cash flow or financial condition 

portions of our business involve the sale of paint coatings and related products to segments of the economy that are cyclical in nature particularly segments relating to construction housing manufacturing and oil production refining storage and transportation our sales to these segments are affected by the levels of discretionary consumer and business spending in these segments during economic downturns in these segments the levels of consumer and business discretionary spending may decrease and the recovery of these segments may lag behind the recovery of the overall economy this decrease in spending will likely reduce the demand for some of our products and may adversely affect our sales earnings cash flow or financial condition 

in recent months interest rates including mortgage rates have risen and are expected to continue to rise in 2018  although interest rates remain low by historical standards this increase may adversely affect the demand for new residential homes existing home turnover and new nonresidential construction challenging market conditions are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and may worsen a worsening in these segments will reduce the demand for some of our products and may adversely impact sales earnings and cash flow 

in the us construction and housing segments the recent demand for new construction has caused contractors to experience a shortage of skilled workers resulting in project backlogs and an adverse effect on the rate of growth of demand for our products while we expect to see higher demand for our products as project backlogs are reduced in the future this labor shortage may adversely impact our sales earnings cash flow or financial condition 

increases in the cost of raw materials and energy may adversely affect our earnings or cash flow 

we purchase raw materials including titanium dioxide and petrochemical feedstock sources such as propylene and ethylene and energy for use in the manufacturing distribution and sale of our products factors such as adverse weather conditions including hurricanes and other disasters can disrupt raw material and fuel supplies and increase our costs although raw materials and energy supplies including oil and natural gas are generally available from various sources in sufficient quantities unexpected shortages and increases in the cost of raw materials and energy or any deterioration in our relationships with or the financial viability of our suppliers may have an adverse effect on our earnings or cash flow in the event we are unable to offset higher costs in a timely manner by sufficiently decreasing our operating costs or raising the prices of our products recently some raw material and energy prices have increased particularly titanium dioxide and petrochemical feedstock sources such as propylene and ethylene the cost of raw materials and energy has in the past experienced and likely will in the future continue to experience periods of volatility 

although we have an extensive customer base the loss of any of our largest customers could adversely affect our sales earnings or cash flow 

we have a large and varied customer base due to our extensive distribution network during 2017  no individual customer accounted for sales totaling more than ten percent of our sales however we have some customers that individually purchase a large amount of products from us although our broad distribution channels help to minimize the impact of the loss of any one customer the loss of any of these large customers could have an adverse effect on our sales earnings or cash flow 

increased competition may reduce our sales earnings or cash flow performance 

we face substantial competition from many international national regional and local competitors of various sizes in the manufacture distribution and sale of our paint coatings and related products some of our competitors are larger than us and have greater financial resources to compete other competitors are smaller and may be able to offer more specialized products technology product quality product innovation breadth of product line technical expertise distribution service and price are the key competitive factors for our business competition in any of these areas may reduce our sales and adversely affect our earnings or cash flow by resulting in decreased sales volumes reduced prices and increased costs of manufacturing distributing and selling our products 

we may not realize the growth opportunities and cost synergies that are anticipated from the acquisition of valspar 

the benefits that are expected to result from the acquisition of valspar will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities and cost synergies as a result of the acquisition our success in realizing these growth opportunities and cost synergies and the timing of this realization depends on the successful integration of valspar there is a significant degree of difficulty and management distraction inherent in the process of integrating an acquisition as sizable as valspar the process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in our activities members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process which will decrease the time they will have to manage our company service existing customers attract new customers and develop new products or strategies if senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration process or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process our business could suffer there can be no assurance that we will successfully or costeffectively integrate valspar the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

even if we are able to integrate valspar successfully this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the growth opportunities and cost synergies that we currently expect from this integration and we cannot guarantee that these benefits will be achieved within anticipated time frames or at all for example we may not be able to eliminate all duplicative costs moreover we may incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of valspar while it is anticipated that certain expenses will be incurred to achieve cost synergies such expenses are difficult to estimate accurately and may exceed current estimates accordingly the benefits from the acquisition may be offset by costs incurred to or delays in integrating the businesses 

we incurred a substantial amount of debt to complete the acquisition of valspar to service our debt we will require a significant amount of cash our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control we also depend on the business of our subsidiaries to satisfy our cash needs if we cannot generate the required cash we may not be able to make the necessary payments required under our indebtedness 

at december 31 2017  we had total debt of approximately 105 billion  which is an increase of 86 billion   since december 31 2016  including indebtedness incurred to complete the acquisition of valspar we have the ability under our existing credit facilities to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future our ability to make payments on our debt fund our other liquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future our historical financial results have been and we anticipate that our future financial results will be subject to fluctuations our ability to generate cash to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control we cannot guarantee that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make payments of our debt fund other liquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures 

the degree to which we are currently leveraged could have important consequences for shareholders for example it could 



 

additionally any failure to comply with covenants in the instruments governing our debt could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived would have a material adverse effect on us 

a significant portion of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries as a result our ability to generate sufficient cash flow for our needs is dependent to some extent on the earnings of our subsidiaries and the payment of those earnings to us in the form of dividends loans or advances and through repayment of loans or advances from us our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay any amounts due on our debt or to provide us with funds to meet our cash flow needs whether in the form of dividends distributions loans or other payments in addition any payment of dividends loans or advances by our subsidiaries could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions payments to us by our subsidiaries will also be contingent upon our subsidiaries’ earnings and business considerations our right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary’s creditors including trade creditors in addition even if we are a creditor of any of our subsidiaries our rights as a creditor would be subordinate to any security interest in the assets of our subsidiaries and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries senior to that held by us finally changes in the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may adversely affect the ability of some of our foreign subsidiaries to repatriate funds to us 

our results of operations cash flow or financial condition may be negatively impacted if we do not successfully integrate future acquisitions into our existing operations and if the performance of the businesses we acquire do not meet our expectations 

we have historically made strategic acquisitions of businesses in the paint and coatings industry and will likely acquire additional businesses in the future as part of our longterm growth strategy the success of future acquisitions depends in large part on our ability to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired companies and manage challenges that may arise as a result of the acquisitions particularly when the acquired businesses operate in new or foreign markets in the event that we do not successfully integrate such future acquisitions into our existing operations so as to realize the expected return on our investment our results of operations cash flow or financial condition could be adversely affected 

risks and uncertainties associated with our expansion into and our operations in asia europe south america and other foreign markets could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

net external sales of our consolidated foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately 198  145  and 158  of our total consolidated net sales in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively sales outside of the united states make up a significant part of our current business and future strategic plans our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition could be adversely affected by a variety of international factors including general economic conditions inflation rates recessions foreign currency exchange rates foreign currency exchange controls interest rates foreign investment and repatriation restrictions legal and regulatory constraints civil unrest difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and other external economic and political factors our inability to successfully manage the risks and uncertainties relating to these factors could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

in many foreign countries it is acceptable to engage in certain business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in because of regulations that are applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act although we have internal control policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these regulations there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prevent a violation of these regulations any violation could cause an adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

because of our international operations we are exposed to risk associated with interest rates and value changes in foreign currencies which may adversely affect our business historically our reported net sales earnings cash flow and financial condition have been subjected to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates our primary exchange rate exposure is with the euro the chinese yuan the brazilian real the canadian dollar the british pound the mexican peso and the australian dollar each against the us dollar while we actively manage the exposure of our foreign currency risk as part of our overall financial risk management policy we believe we may experience losses from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and such losses could adversely affect our sales earnings cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we are subject to a wide variety of complex domestic and foreign laws rules and regulations for which compliance could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

we are subject to a wide variety of complex domestic and foreign laws rules and regulations and legal compliance risks including securities laws tax laws employment and pensionrelated laws competition laws us and foreign export and trading laws data privacy and security laws and laws governing improper business practices we are affected by new laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations including interpretations by courts and regulators from time to time our company our operations and the industries in which we operate are being reviewed or investigated by regulators which could lead to enforcement actions or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages 

although we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to mitigate these risks the global and diverse nature of our operations means that compliance risks will continue to exist investigations examinations and other proceedings the nature and outcome of which cannot be predicted will likely arise from time to time these investigations examinations and other proceedings could subject us to significant liability and require us to take significant accruals or pay significant settlements fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

we are subject to tax laws and regulations in the united states and multiple foreign jurisdictions we are affected by changes in tax laws and regulations as well as changes in related interpretations and other tax guidance in the ordinary course of our business we are subject to examinations and investigations by various tax authorities in addition to existing examinations and investigations there could be additional examinations and investigations in the future and existing examinations and investigations could be expanded 

on december 22 2017 us tax reform legislation known as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” was signed into law the tax act makes substantial changes to us tax law including a reduction in the corporate tax rate a limitation on deductibility of interest expense a limitation on the use of net operating losses to offset future taxable income the allowance of immediate expensing of capital expenditures deemed repatriation of foreign earnings and significant changes to the taxation of foreign earnings going forward the tax act contains numerous complex provisions impacting us multinational companies and we continue to review and assess the legislative language and its potential impact on us the full extent of the impact remains uncertain at this time and our current interpretations of and assumptions regarding the tax act are subject to additional regulatory or administrative developments including any regulations or other guidance promulgated by the us internal revenue service as a result the tax act including any regulations or other guidance promulgated by the us internal revenue service and other tax laws could have significant effects on us some of which may be adverse and could materially and adversely impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

for nonincome tax risks we estimate material loss contingencies and accrue for such loss contingencies as required by us generally accepted accounting principles based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency in the event the loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently accrued the recording of the additional liability may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such additional liability is accrued in those cases where no accrual is recorded because it is not probable that a liability has been incurred and cannot be reasonably estimated any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued or paid for income tax risks we recognize tax benefits based on our assessment that a tax benefit has a greater than 50 likelihood of being sustained upon ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant facts for those income tax positions where we assess that there is not a greater than 50 likelihood that such tax benefits will be sustained we do not recognize a tax benefit in our financial statements subsequent events may cause us to change our assessment of the likelihood of sustaining a previouslyrecognized benefit which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial position for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued or paid 

we discuss risks and uncertainties with regard to taxes in more detail in note 14  of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 70  through 72  of our 2017  annual report 

adverse weather conditions and natural disasters may temporarily reduce the demand for some of our products and could have a negative effect on our sales earnings or cash flow 

our business is seasonal in nature with the second and third quarters typically generating a higher proportion of sales and earnings than other quarters from time to time adverse weather conditions and natural disasters have had an adverse effect on our sales of paint coatings and related products for example during 2017 the impact of hurricanes harvey irma and maria on our operations in texas florida the caribbean and neighboring areas as well as two earthquakes in mexico resulted in a 

temporary shutdown of our companyoperated paint stores manufacturing facilities and distribution centers in the affected regions resulting in reduced revenues in addition unusually cold and rainy weather could have an adverse effect on sales of our exterior paint products an adverse effect on sales may cause a reduction in our earnings or cash flow 

inability to protect or enforce our material trademarks and other intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our business 

we have numerous patents trade secrets trademarks trade names and knowhow that are valuable to our business despite our efforts to protect such intellectual property and other proprietary information from unauthorized use or disclosure third parties may attempt to disclose obtain or use our trademarks or such other intellectual property and information without our authorization although we rely on the patent trademark trade secret and copyright laws of the united states and other countries to protect our intellectual property rights the laws of some countries may not protect such rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties the failure of foreign countries to have laws to protect our intellectual property rights or an inability to effectively enforce such rights in foreign countries could have an adverse effect on our business 

unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential customer employee supplier or company information whether through a breach of our computer systems including cyber attacks or otherwise could severely harm our business 

as part of our business we collect process and retain sensitive and confidential personal information about our customers employees and suppliers despite the security measures we have in place our facilities and systems and those of the retailers dealers licensees and other third party suppliers and vendors with which we do business may be vulnerable to security breaches cyber attacks acts of vandalism or misconduct computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors or other similar events any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer employee supplier or company information whether by us or by the retailers dealers licensees and other third party suppliers and vendors with which we do business could result in losses severely damage our reputation expose us to the risks of litigation and liability disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition as cyber security threats evolve in sophistication and become more prevalent in numerous industries worldwide we continue to increase our sensitivity and attention to these threats and seek additional investments and resources to address these threats and enhance the security of our facilities and systems the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and privacy is increasingly rigorous and complex with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs 

we are required to comply with numerous complex and increasingly stringent domestic and foreign health safety and environmental laws and regulations the cost of which is likely to increase and may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

our operations are subject to various domestic and foreign health safety and environmental laws and regulations these laws and regulations not only govern our current operations and products but also impose potential liability on us for our past operations we expect health safety and environmental laws and regulations to impose increasingly stringent requirements upon our industry and us in the future our costs to comply with these laws and regulations may increase as these requirements become more stringent in the future and these increased costs may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

we are involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of our currently and formerly owned sites as well as a number of thirdparty sites for which our ultimate liability may exceed the current amount we have accrued 

we are involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of our currently and formerly owned sites and a number of thirdparty sites we accrue for estimated costs of investigation and remediation activities at these sites for which commitments or cleanup plans have been developed and when such costs can be reasonably estimated based on industry standards and professional judgment these estimated costs are based on currently available facts regarding each site we continuously assess our potential liability for investigation and remediation activities and adjust our environmentalrelated accruals as information becomes available upon which more accurate costs can be reasonably estimated due to the uncertainties surrounding environmental investigation and remediation activities our liability may result in costs that are significantly higher than currently accrued and may have an adverse effect on our earnings we discuss these risks and uncertainties in more detail on page 23  of our 2017  annual report under the caption “environmental matters” page 27  of our 2017  annual report under the caption “environmentalrelated liabilities” and in note 8  of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 62  through 63  of our 2017  annual report 

the nature cost quantity and outcome of pending and future litigation such as litigation arising from the historical manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paint could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity and financial condition 

in the course of our business we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits including but not limited to litigation relating to product liability and warranty personal injury environmental intellectual property commercial contractual and antitrust claims that are inherently subject to many uncertainties regarding the possibility of a loss to us these uncertainties will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur confirming the incurrence of a liability or the reduction of a liability in accordance with the contingencies topic of the asc we accrue for these contingencies by a charge to income when it is both probable that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact of a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated in the event that a loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently accrued the recording of the additional liability may result in a material impact on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such additional liability is accrued in those cases where no accrual is recorded because it is not probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of any such loss cannot be reasonably estimated any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us may result in a material impact on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued in those cases where no accrual is recorded or exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued the contingencies topic of the asc requires disclosure of the contingency when there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or additional loss may have been incurred 

our past operations included the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paints along with other companies we are and have been a defendant in a number of legal proceedings including individual personal injury actions purported class actions and actions brought by various counties cities school districts and other governmentrelated entities arising from the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paints the plaintiffs claims have been based upon various legal theories including negligence strict liability breach of warranty negligent misrepresentations and omissions fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions concert of action civil conspiracy violations of unfair trade practice and consumer protection laws enterprise liability market share liability public nuisance unjust enrichment and other theories the plaintiffs seek various damages and relief including personal injury and property damage costs relating to the detection and abatement of leadbased paint from buildings costs associated with a public education campaign medical monitoring costs and others we have also been a defendant in legal proceedings arising from the manufacture and sale of nonleadbased paints that seek recovery based upon various legal theories including the failure to adequately warn of potential exposure to lead during surface preparation when using nonleadbased paint on surfaces previously painted with leadbased paint we believe that the litigation brought to date is without merit or subject to meritorious defenses and are vigorously defending such litigation we have not settled any material lead pigment or leadbased paint litigation we expect that additional lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation may be filed against us in the future asserting similar or different legal theories and seeking similar or different types of damages and relief 

notwithstanding our views on the merits litigation is inherently subject to many uncertainties and we ultimately may not prevail adverse court rulings such as the courts decision in the santa clara county california proceeding the jury verdict against us and other defendants in the state of rhode island action and the wisconsin state supreme court’s determination that wisconsin’s risk contribution theory may apply in the lead pigment litigation or determinations of liability among other factors could affect the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation against us and encourage an increase in the number and nature of future claims and proceedings in addition from time to time various legislation and administrative regulations have been enacted promulgated or proposed to impose obligations on present and former manufacturers of lead pigments and leadbased paints respecting asserted health concerns associated with such products or to overturn the effect of court decisions in which we and other manufacturers have been successful 

due to the uncertainties involved management is unable to predict the outcome of the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation the number or nature of possible future claims and proceedings or the effect that any legislation andor administrative regulations may have on the litigation or against us in addition management cannot reasonably determine the scope or amount of the potential costs and liabilities related to such litigation or resulting from any such legislation and regulations we have not accrued any amounts for such litigation with respect to such litigation including the public nuisance litigation the company does not believe that it is probable that a loss has occurred and it is not possible to estimate the range of potential losses as there is no prior history of a loss of this nature and there is no substantive information upon which an estimate could be based in addition any potential liability that may result from any changes to legislation and regulations cannot reasonably be estimated in the event any significant liability is determined to be attributable to us relating to such litigation the recording of the liability may result in a material impact on net income for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued additionally due to the uncertainties associated with the amount of any such liability andor the nature of any other remedy which may be imposed in such litigation any potential liability determined to be attributable to us arising out of such litigation may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial 

condition an estimate of the potential impact on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition cannot be made due to the aforementioned uncertainties 

a trial commenced in the santa clara county california proceeding on july 15 2013 and ended on august 22 2013 the court entered final judgment on january 27 2014 finding in favor of the plaintiffs and against the company and two other defendants conagra grocery products company and nl industries inc the final judgment held the company jointly and severally liable with the other two defendants to pay 115 billion into a fund to abate the public nuisance the company strongly disagrees with the judgment on february 18 2014 the company filed a motion for a new trial and a motion to vacate the judgment the court denied these motions on march 24 2014 on march 28 2014 the company filed a notice of appeal to the sixth district court of appeal for the state of california the filing of the notice of appeal effects an automatic stay of the judgment without the requirement to post a bond oral argument before the sixth district court of appeal was held on august 24 2017 on november 14 2017 the sixth district court of appeal entered its decision which affirmed the trial court’s judgment of liability with respect to residences built before 1951 and reversed and vacated the trial court’s judgment with respect to residences built after 1950 the sixth district court of appeal directed the trial court to i recalculate the amount of the abatement fund to limit the fund to the amount necessary to cover the cost of inspecting and remediating pre1951 residences and ii hold an evidentiary hearing to appoint a suitable receiver on november 29 2017 the company and the two other defendants filed separate petitions for rehearing which the sixth district court of appeal denied on december 6 2017 the sixth district court of appeal’s decision became final on december 14 2017 on december 22 2017 the company and the two other defendants submitted separate petitions for review to the california supreme court on february 14 2018 the california supreme court issued an order denying the petitions for review the company believes that the judgment conflicts with established principles of law and is unsupported by the evidence the company intends to file a petition for writ of certiorari with the supreme court of the united states seeking discretionary review the company also intends to file a motion to stay the santa clara county california proceeding while the petition for writ of certiorari is pending 

although the company believes it is probable that a loss has occurred the company has concluded that it is not possible to reasonably estimate the range of potential loss due to the numerous possible outcomes and uncertainties including but not limited to i the final amount of the abatement fund necessary to cover the cost of inspecting and remediating pre1951 residences as recalculated by the trial court and ii the portion of the abatement fund for which the company the two other defendants and others are determined to be responsible if the company concludes that it is possible to reasonably estimate the range of potential loss once more definitive information becomes available the company will recognize the loss and disclose such information because of joint and several liability it is possible the company could ultimately be liable for the total amount of the abatement fund in the event any significant liability is determined to be attributable to the company relating to such litigation the recording of any liability may result in a material impact on the company’s results of operations liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued 

we discuss the risks and uncertainties related to litigation including the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation in more detail in note 9  of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 63  through 66  of our 2017  annual report

seasonality 

the majority of the sales for the reportable segments traditionally occur during the second and third quarters there is no significant seasonality in sales for the administrative segment 

working capital

patents

backlog and productive capacity 

backlog orders are not significant in the business of any reportable segment since there is normally a short period of time between the placing of an order and shipment we believe that sufficient productive capacity currently exists to fulfill our needs for paint coatings and related products through 2017

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks described below and in other documents that we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

adverse changes in general business and economic conditions in the united states and worldwide may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

our business is sensitive to global and regional business and economic conditions adverse changes in such conditions in the united states and worldwide may reduce the demand for some of our products and impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us each of which could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition higher inflation rates interest rates tax rates and unemployment rates higher labor and healthcare costs recessions changing governmental policies laws and regulations and other economic factors could also adversely affect demand for some of our products and our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition and that of our customers vendors and suppliers 

a weakening or reversal of the general economic recovery in the united states and other countries and regions in which we do business or the continuation or worsening of the economic downturn in other countries and regions may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

global economic uncertainty continues to exist a weakening or reversal of the general economic recovery in the united states and other countries and regions in which we do business or the continuation or worsening of the economic downturn in other countries and regions may adversely impact our net sales the collection of accounts receivable funding for working capital needs expected cash flow generation from current and acquired businesses and our investments which may adversely impact our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we finance a portion of our sales through trade credit credit markets remain tight and some customers who require financing for their businesses have not been able to obtain necessary financing a continuation or worsening of these conditions could limit our ability to collect our accounts receivable which could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we generally fund a portion of our seasonal working capital needs and obtain funding for other general corporate purposes through shortterm borrowings backed by our revolving credit facility and other financing facilities if any of the banks in these credit and financing facilities are unable to perform on their commitments which could adversely affect our ability to fund seasonal working capital needs and obtain funding for other general corporate purposes our cash flow liquidity or financial condition could be adversely impacted 

although we currently have available credit facilities to fund our current operating needs we cannot be certain that we will be able to replace our existing credit facilities or refinance our existing or future debt when necessary our cost of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by our debt and credit ratings assigned by the major credit rating agencies downgrades in these ratings will increase our cost of borrowing and could have an adverse effect on our access to the capital markets including our access to the commercial paper market an inability to access the capital markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we have goodwill and intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet we periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such value may not be recoverable impairment assessment involves judgment as to assumptions regarding future sales and cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions future events and changing market conditions may impact our assumptions and may result in changes in our estimates of future sales and cash flows that may result in us incurring substantial impairment charges which would adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

we hold investments in equity and debt securities in some of our defined benefit pension plans a decrease in the value of plan assets resulting from a general financial downturn may cause a negative pension plan investment performance which may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

protracted duration of economic downturns in cyclical segments of the economy may depress the demand for some of our products and adversely affect our sales earnings cash flow or financial condition 

portions of our business involve the sale of paint coatings and related products to segments of the economy that are cyclical in nature particularly segments relating to construction housing manufacturing and oil production refining storage and transportation our sales to these segments are affected by the levels of discretionary consumer and business spending in these segments during economic downturns in these segments the levels of consumer and business discretionary spending may decrease and the recovery of these segments may lag behind the recovery of the overall economy this decrease in spending will likely reduce the demand for some of our products and may adversely affect our sales earnings cash flow or financial condition 

during the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 the us homebuilding industry experienced a significant and sustained decrease in demand for new homes and an oversupply of new and existing homes available for sale during this same time period the us real estate industry also experienced a significant decrease in existing home turnover the commercial and industrial building and maintenance sectors also experienced a significant decline the downturn in each of these segments contributed to an unprecedented decline in the demand for some of our products the recovery in new home starts existing home sales and new commercial construction has been sluggish and erratic in many markets and remain below their prerecession highs in recent months interest rates including mortgage rates have risen and are expected to continue to rise in 2017 although interest rates remain low by historical standards this increase may adversely affect the demand for new residential homes existing home turnover and new nonresidential construction challenging market conditions are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and may worsen a worsening in these segments will reduce the demand for some of our products and may adversely impact sales earnings and cash flow 

in the us construction and housing segments the recent demand for new construction has caused contractors to experience a shortage of skilled workers resulting in project backlogs and an adverse effect on the rate of growth of demand for our products while we expect to see higher demand for our products as project backlogs are reduced in the future this labor shortage may adversely impact our sales earnings cash flow or financial condition 

increases in the cost of raw materials and energy may adversely affect our earnings or cash flow 

we purchase raw materials including titanium dioxide and petrochemical feedstock sources such as propylene and ethylene and energy for use in the manufacturing distribution and sale of our products factors such as adverse weather conditions including hurricanes and other disasters can disrupt raw material and fuel supplies and increase our costs although raw materials and energy supplies including oil and natural gas are generally available from various sources in sufficient 

quantities unexpected shortages and increases in the cost of raw materials and energy or any deterioration in our relationships with or the financial viability of our suppliers may have an adverse effect on our earnings or cash flow in the event we are unable to offset higher costs in a timely manner by sufficiently decreasing our operating costs or raising the prices of our products recently some raw material and energy prices have increased particularly titanium dioxide and petrochemical feedstock sources such as propylene and ethylene the cost of raw materials and energy has in the past experienced and likely will in the future continue to experience periods of volatility 

although we have an extensive customer base the loss of any of our largest customers could adversely affect our sales earnings or cash flow 

we have a large and varied customer base due to our extensive distribution network during 2016  no individual customer accounted for sales totaling more than ten percent of our sales however we have some customers that individually purchase a large amount of products from us although our broad distribution channels help to minimize the impact of the loss of any one customer the loss of any of these large customers could have an adverse effect on our sales earnings or cash flow 

adverse weather conditions may temporarily reduce the demand for some of our products and could have a negative effect on our sales earnings or cash flow 

our business is seasonal in nature with the second and third quarters typically generating a higher proportion of sales and earnings than other quarters from time to time adverse weather conditions in certain parts of the united states have had an adverse effect on our sales of paint coatings and related products for example unusually cold and rainy weather could have an adverse effect on sales of our exterior paint products an adverse effect on sales may cause a reduction in our earnings or cash flow 

increased competition may reduce our sales earnings or cash flow performance 

we face substantial competition from many international national regional and local competitors of various sizes in the manufacture distribution and sale of our paint coatings and related products some of our competitors are larger than us and have greater financial resources to compete other competitors are smaller and may be able to offer more specialized products technology product quality product innovation breadth of product line technical expertise distribution service and price are the key competitive factors for our business competition in any of these areas may reduce our sales and adversely affect our earnings or cash flow by resulting in decreased sales volumes reduced prices and increased costs of manufacturing distributing and selling our products 

inability to protect or enforce our material trademarks and other intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our business 

we have numerous patents trade secrets trademarks trade names and knowhow that are valuable to our business despite our efforts to protect such intellectual property and other proprietary information from unauthorized use or disclosure third parties may attempt to disclose obtain or use our trademarks or such other intellectual property and information without our authorization although we rely on the patent trademark trade secret and copyright laws of the united states and other countries to protect our intellectual property rights the laws of some countries may not protect such rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties the failure of foreign countries to have laws to protect our intellectual property rights or an inability to effectively enforce such rights in foreign countries could have an adverse effect on our business 

our planned acquisition of valspar may not occur at all may not occur in the expected time frame or may involve the divestiture of certain businesses which may negatively affect the trading prices of our stock and our future business and financial results 

on march 19 2016 we and viking merger sub inc one of our wholly owned subsidiaries which we refer to as merger sub entered into an agreement and plan of merger or merger agreement with valspar pursuant to which among other things and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified conditions merger sub will merge with and into valspar as a result of the planned acquisition of valspar merger sub will cease to exist and valspar will survive as a wholly owned subsidiary of ours 

completion of the planned acquisition of valspar is not assured and is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions including among others the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 as amended and the receipt of other required antitrust approvals 

the planned acquisition of valspar is subject to risks and uncertainties including the risk that the necessary regulatory approvals will not be obtained the risk that the parties to the merger agreement may be required to divest certain businesses or assets in connection with the planned acquisition or that other closing conditions will not be satisfied for example in connection with obtaining the required regulatory approvals the company andor valspar may be required to divest assets of their respective businesses we are not required to consummate the planned acquisition of valspar if antitrust authorities require 

the divestiture of assets of valspar or us representing in the aggregate more than 15 billion in net sales which for purposes of such calculation uses net sales for the applicable valspar assets calculated as of october 30 2015 with certain exclusions in addition if these divested businesses represent in the aggregate less than 15 billion in net sales but more than 650 million in net sales which for purposes of such calculation uses net sales for the applicable valspar assets calculated as of october 30 2015 subject to certain exclusions then the per share consideration paid to valspar stockholders in connection with the planned acquisition will be 105 in cash instead of 113 in cash if the planned acquisition of valspar is not completed if there are significant delays in completing the planned acquisition or if the planned acquisition involves the divestiture of certain businesses it could negatively affect the trading prices of our common stock and our future business and financial results and could result in our failure to realize certain synergies relating to such acquisition 

our obligation to complete the planned acquisition of valspar is not subject to a financing condition 

our obligation to complete the planned acquisition of valspar is not subject to a financing condition we have obtained committed financing for 93 billion to pay a substantial portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of valspar if any of the banks in the committed financing facilities are unable to perform their commitments we may be required to finance a portion of the purchase price of the planned acquisition at interest rates higher than currently expected 

we may not realize the growth opportunities and cost synergies that are anticipated from the planned acquisition of valspar 

the benefits that are expected to result from the planned acquisition of valspar will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities and cost synergies as a result of the planned acquisition our success in realizing these growth opportunities and cost synergies and the timing of this realization depends on whether the company or valspar are required to divest assets of their respective business and on the successful integration of valspar there is a significant degree of difficulty and management distraction inherent in the process of integrating an acquisition as sizable as valspar the process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in our and valspar’s activities members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process which will decrease the time they will have to manage our company service existing customers attract new customers and develop new products or strategies if senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration process or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process our business could suffer there can be no assurance that we will successfully or costeffectively integrate valspar the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

even if we are able to integrate valspar successfully this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the growth opportunities and cost synergies that we currently expect from this integration and we cannot guarantee that these benefits will be achieved within anticipated time frames or at all for example we may not be able to eliminate duplicative costs moreover we may incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of valspar while it is anticipated that certain expenses will be incurred to achieve cost synergies such expenses are difficult to estimate accurately and may exceed current estimates accordingly the benefits from the planned acquisition may be offset by costs incurred to or delays in integrating the businesses 

we will incur a substantial amount of debt to complete the planned acquisition of valspar to service our debt we will require a significant amount of cash our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control we also depend on the business of our subsidiaries to satisfy our cash needs if we cannot generate the required cash we may not be able to make the necessary payments required under our indebtedness 

at december 31 2016  we had total debt of approximately 20 billion  we have the ability under our existing credit facilities to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future and we plan to incur significant additional indebtedness in the event we complete the planned acquisition of valspar we expect to incur up to 93 billion of debt to complete the acquisition of valspar our ability to make payments on our debt fund our other liquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future our historical financial results have been and we anticipate that our future financial results will be subject to fluctuations our ability to generate cash to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control we cannot guarantee that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make payments of our debt fund other liquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures 

the degree to which we are currently leveraged and will be leveraged following the completion of the planned acquisition could have important consequences for shareholders for example it could 



 

additionally any failure to comply with covenants in the instruments governing our debt could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived would have a material adverse effect on us 

a significant portion of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries as a result our ability to generate sufficient cash flow for our needs is dependent to some extent on the earnings of our subsidiaries and the payment of those earnings to us in the form of dividends loans or advances and through repayment of loans or advances from us our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay any amounts due on our debt or to provide us with funds to meet our cash flow needs whether in the form of dividends distributions loans or other payments in addition any payment of dividends loans or advances by our subsidiaries could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions payments to us by our subsidiaries will also be contingent upon our subsidiaries’ earnings and business considerations our right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary’s creditors including trade creditors in addition even if we are a creditor of any of our subsidiaries our rights as a creditor would be subordinate to any security interest in the assets of our subsidiaries and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries senior to that held by us finally changes in the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may adversely affect the ability of some of our foreign subsidiaries to repatriate funds to us 

our results of operations cash flow or financial condition may be negatively impacted if we do not successfully integrate future acquisitions into our existing operations and if the performance of the businesses we acquire do not meet our expectations 

we have historically made strategic acquisitions of businesses in the paint and coatings industry and will likely acquire additional businesses in the future as part of our longterm growth strategy the success of future acquisitions including the planned acquisition of valspar depends in large part on our ability to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired companies and manage challenges that may arise as a result of the acquisitions particularly when the acquired businesses operate in new or foreign markets in the event that we do not successfully integrate such future acquisitions into our existing operations so as to realize the expected return on our investment our results of operations cash flow or financial condition could be adversely affected 

risks and uncertainties associated with our expansion into and our operations in asia europe south america and other foreign markets could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

net external sales of our consolidated foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately 145  158  and 198  of our total consolidated net sales in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively sales outside of the united states make up a significant part of our current business and future strategic plans our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition could be adversely affected by a variety of international factors including general economic conditions inflation rates recessions foreign currency exchange rates foreign currency exchange controls interest rates foreign investment and repatriation restrictions legal and regulatory constraints civil unrest difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and other external economic and political factors our inability to successfully manage the risks and uncertainties relating to these factors could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

in many foreign countries it is acceptable to engage in certain business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in because of regulations that are applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act although we have internal control policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these regulations there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prevent a violation of these regulations any violation could cause an adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

because of our international operations we are exposed to risk associated with interest rates and value changes in foreign currencies which may adversely affect our business historically our reported net sales earnings cash flow and financial condition have been subjected to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates our primary exchange rate exposure is with the argentine peso the brazilian real the british pound the canadian dollar the chilean peso the euro and the mexican peso each against the us dollar while we actively manage the exposure of our foreign currency risk as part of our overall financial risk management policy we believe we may experience losses from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and such losses could adversely affect our sales earnings cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we are subject to a wide variety of complex domestic and foreign laws rules and regulations for which compliance could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

we are subject to a wide variety of complex domestic and foreign laws rules and regulations and legal compliance risks including securities laws tax laws employment and pensionrelated laws competition laws us and foreign export and trading laws data privacy and security laws and laws governing improper business practices we are affected by new laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations including interpretations by courts and regulators from time to time our company our operations and the industries in which we operate are being reviewed or investigated by regulators which could lead to enforcement actions or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages 

although we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to mitigate these risks the global and diverse nature of our operations means that compliance risks will continue to exist investigations examinations and other proceedings the nature and outcome of which cannot be predicted will likely arise from time to time these investigations examinations and other proceedings could subject us to significant liability and require us to take significant accruals or pay significant settlements fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

we are subject to tax laws and regulations in the united states and multiple foreign jurisdictions we are affected by changes in tax laws and regulations as well as changes in related interpretations and other tax guidance in the ordinary course of our business we are subject to examinations and investigations by various tax authorities in addition to existing examinations and investigations there could be additional examinations and investigations in the future and existing examinations and investigations could be expanded 

for nonincome tax risks we estimate material loss contingencies and accrue for such loss contingencies as required by us generally accepted accounting principles based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency in the event the loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently accrued the recording of the additional liability may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such additional liability is accrued in those cases where no accrual is recorded because it is not probable that a liability has been incurred and cannot be reasonably estimated any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued or paid for income tax risks we recognize tax benefits based on our assessment that a tax benefit has a greater than 50 likelihood of being sustained upon ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant facts for those income tax positions where we assess that there is not a greater than 50 likelihood that such tax benefits will be sustained we do not recognize a tax benefit in our financial statements subsequent events may cause us to change our assessment of the likelihood of sustaining a previouslyrecognized benefit which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial position for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued or paid 

we discuss risks and uncertainties with regard to taxes in more detail in note 14  of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 69  and 70  of our 2016  annual report 

unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential customer employee supplier or company information whether through a breach of our computer systems including cyber attacks or otherwise could severely harm our business 

as part of our business we collect process and retain sensitive and confidential personal information about our customers employees and suppliers despite the security measures we have in place our facilities and systems and those of the retailers dealers licensees and other third party suppliers and vendors with which we do business may be vulnerable to security breaches cyber attacks acts of vandalism or misconduct computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors or other similar events any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer employee supplier or company information whether by us or by the retailers dealers licensees and other third party suppliers and vendors with which we do business could result in losses severely damage our reputation expose us to the risks of litigation and liability disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition as cyber security threats evolve in sophistication and become more prevalent in numerous industries worldwide we continue to increase our sensitivity and attention to these threats and seek additional investments and resources to address these threats and enhance the security of our facilities and systems the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and privacy is increasingly rigorous and complex with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs 

we are required to comply with numerous complex and increasingly stringent domestic and foreign health safety and environmental laws and regulations the cost of which is likely to increase and may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

our operations are subject to various domestic and foreign health safety and environmental laws and regulations these laws and regulations not only govern our current operations and products but also impose potential liability on us for our past operations we expect health safety and environmental laws and regulations to impose increasingly stringent requirements upon our industry and us in the future our costs to comply with these laws and regulations may increase as these requirements become more stringent in the future and these increased costs may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

we are involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of our currently and formerly owned sites as well as a number of thirdparty sites for which our ultimate liability may exceed the current amount we have accrued 

we are involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of our currently and formerly owned sites and a number of thirdparty sites we accrue for estimated costs of investigation and remediation activities at these sites for which commitments or cleanup plans have been developed and when such costs can be reasonably estimated based on industry standards and professional judgment these estimated costs are based on currently available facts regarding each site we continuously assess our potential liability for investigation and remediation activities and adjust our environmentalrelated accruals as information becomes available upon which more accurate costs can be reasonably estimated due to the uncertainties surrounding environmental investigation and remediation activities our liability may result in costs that are significantly higher than currently accrued and may have an adverse effect on our earnings we discuss these risks and uncertainties in more detail on page 25  of our 2016  annual report under the caption “environmental matters” page 29  of our 2016  annual report under the caption “environmentalrelated liabilities” and in note 8  of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 61  through 62  of our 2016  annual report 

the nature cost quantity and outcome of pending and future litigation such as litigation arising from the historical manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paint could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity and financial condition 

in the course of our business we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits including but not limited to litigation relating to product liability and warranty personal injury environmental intellectual property commercial contractual and antitrust claims that are inherently subject to many uncertainties regarding the possibility of a loss to us these uncertainties will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur confirming the incurrence of a liability or the reduction of a liability in accordance with the contingencies topic of the asc we accrue for these contingencies by a charge to income when it is both probable that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact of a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated in the event that a loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently accrued the recording of the additional liability may result in a material impact on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such additional liability is accrued in those cases where no accrual is recorded because it is not probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of any such loss cannot be reasonably estimated any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us may result in a material impact on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued in those cases where no accrual is recorded or exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued the contingencies topic of the asc requires disclosure of the contingency when there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or additional loss may have been incurred 

our past operations included the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paints along with other companies we are and have been a defendant in a number of legal proceedings including individual personal injury actions purported class actions and actions brought by various counties cities school districts and other governmentrelated entities arising from the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paints the plaintiffs claims have been based upon various legal theories including negligence strict liability breach of warranty negligent misrepresentations and omissions fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions concert of action civil conspiracy violations of unfair trade practice and consumer protection laws enterprise liability market share liability public nuisance unjust enrichment and other theories the plaintiffs seek various damages and relief including personal injury and property damage costs relating to the detection and abatement of leadbased paint from buildings costs associated with a public education campaign medical monitoring costs and others we have also been a defendant in legal proceedings arising from the manufacture and sale of nonleadbased paints that seek recovery based upon various legal theories including the failure to adequately warn of potential exposure to lead during surface preparation when using nonleadbased paint on surfaces previously painted with leadbased paint we believe that the litigation brought to date is without merit or subject to meritorious defenses and are vigorously defending such litigation we have not settled any material lead pigment or leadbased paint litigation we expect that additional lead pigment and leadbased 

paint litigation may be filed against us in the future asserting similar or different legal theories and seeking similar or different types of damages and relief 

notwithstanding our views on the merits litigation is inherently subject to many uncertainties and we ultimately may not prevail adverse court rulings such as the courts decision in the santa clara county california proceeding the jury verdict against us and other defendants in the state of rhode island action and the wisconsin state supreme court’s determination that wisconsin’s risk contribution theory may apply in the lead pigment litigation or determinations of liability among other factors could affect the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation against us and encourage an increase in the number and nature of future claims and proceedings in addition from time to time various legislation and administrative regulations have been enacted promulgated or proposed to impose obligations on present and former manufacturers of lead pigments and leadbased paints respecting asserted health concerns associated with such products or to overturn the effect of court decisions in which we and other manufacturers have been successful 

due to the uncertainties involved management is unable to predict the outcome of the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation the number or nature of possible future claims and proceedings or the effect that any legislation andor administrative regulations may have on the litigation or against us in addition management cannot reasonably determine the scope or amount of the potential costs and liabilities related to such litigation or resulting from any such legislation and regulations we have not accrued any amounts for such litigation with respect to such litigation including the public nuisance litigation the company does not believe that it is probable that a loss has occurred and it is not possible to estimate the range of potential losses as there is no prior history of a loss of this nature and there is no substantive information upon which an estimate could be based in addition any potential liability that may result from any changes to legislation and regulations cannot reasonably be estimated in the event any significant liability is determined to be attributable to us relating to such litigation the recording of the liability may result in a material impact on net income for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued additionally due to the uncertainties associated with the amount of any such liability andor the nature of any other remedy which may be imposed in such litigation any potential liability determined to be attributable to us arising out of such litigation may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition an estimate of the potential impact on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition cannot be made due to the aforementioned uncertainties 

a trial commenced in the santa clara county california proceeding on july 15 2013 and ended on august 22 2013 the court entered final judgment on january 27 2014 finding in favor of the plaintiffs and against the company and two other defendants and holding the company jointly and severally liable with the other two defendants to pay 115 billion into a fund to abate the public nuisance the company has filed a notice of appeal however if the appeal process is unsuccessful at reversing the decision or otherwise reducing the amount of the judgment we and the other defendants will be subject to significant liabilities costs and expenses to abate the public nuisance in on and around residences in the plaintiffs jurisdictions which could encourage an increase in future public nuisance claims and proceedings any adverse court rulings or any determinations of liability against us may result in a material impact on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition 

we discuss the risks and uncertainties related to litigation including the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation in more detail on page 25  of our 2016  annual report under the caption “litigation and other contingent liabilities” and in note 9  of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 62  through 65  of our 2016  annual report

we report our segment information in the same way that management internally organizes our business for assessing performance and making decisions regarding allocation of resources in accordance with the segment reporting topic of the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification asc we have four reportable operating segments paint stores group consumer group global finishes group and latin america coatings group individually a reportable segment and collectively the “reportable segments” factors considered in determining our reportable segments include the nature of business activities the management structure directly accountable to the company’s chief operating decision maker codm for operating and administrative activities availability of discrete financial information and information presented to our board of directors we report all other business activities and immaterial operating segments that are not reportable in the administrative segment for more information about the reportable segments see pages 8  through 17  of our 2015  annual report which is incorporated herein by reference

by the company in its primary businesses gains and losses from the sale of property were not a significant operating factor in determining the performance of the administrative segment

raw materials and products purchased for resale 

we believe we generally have adequate sources of raw materials and fuel supplies used in our business there are sufficient suppliers of each product purchased for resale that none of the reportable segments anticipate any significant sourcing problems during 2016  see item 1a risk factors for more information regarding cost and sourcing of raw materials 

seasonality 

the majority of the sales for the reportable segments traditionally occur during the second and third quarters there is no significant seasonality in sales for the administrative segment 

working capital 

in order to meet increased demand during the second and third quarters the company usually builds its inventories during the first quarter working capital items inventories and accounts receivable are generally financed through shortterm borrowings which include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of commercial paper for a description of the company’s liquidity and capital resources see pages 26  through 32  of our 2015  annual report under the caption “financial condition liquidity and cash flow” of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” which is incorporated herein by reference 

trademarks and trade names 

customer recognition of our trademarks and trade names collectively contribute significantly to our sales the major trademarks and trade names used by each of the reportable segments are set forth below 

 3 

patents 

although patents and licenses are not of material importance to our business as a whole or any segment the global finishes group and latin america coatings group derive a portion of their income from the licensing of technology trademarks and trade names to foreign companies 

backlog and productive capacity 

backlog orders are not significant in the business of any reportable segment since there is normally a short period of time between the placing of an order and shipment we believe that sufficient productive capacity currently exists to fulfill our needs for paint coatings and related products through 2016  

research and development 

for information regarding our costs of research and development included in technical expenditures see note 1  of the notes to consolidated financial statements on page 49  of our 2015  annual report which is incorporated herein by reference

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks described below and in other documents that we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

adverse changes in general business and economic conditions in the united states and worldwide may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

our business is sensitive to global and regional business and economic conditions adverse changes in such conditions in the united states and worldwide may reduce the demand for some of our products and impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us each of which could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition higher inflation rates interest rates tax rates and unemployment rates higher labor and healthcare costs recessions changing governmental policies laws and regulations and other economic factors could also adversely affect demand for some of our products and our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition and that of our customers vendors and suppliers 

a weakening or reversal of the general economic recovery in the united states and other countries and regions in which we do business or the continuation or worsening of the economic downturn in other countries and regions may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

global economic uncertainty continues to exist a weakening or reversal of the general economic recovery in the united states and other countries and regions in which we do business or the continuation or worsening of the economic downturn in other countries and regions may adversely impact our net sales the collection of accounts receivable funding for working capital needs expected cash flow generation from current and acquired businesses and our investments which may adversely impact our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we finance a portion of our sales through trade credit credit markets remain tight and some customers who require financing for their businesses have not been able to obtain necessary financing a continuation or worsening of these conditions could limit our ability to collect our accounts receivable which could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we generally fund a portion of our seasonal working capital needs and obtain funding for other general corporate purposes through shortterm borrowings backed by our revolving credit facility and other financing facilities if any of the banks in these credit and financing facilities are unable to perform on their commitments which could adversely affect our ability to fund seasonal working capital needs and obtain funding for other general corporate purposes our cash flow liquidity or financial condition could be adversely impacted 

although we currently have available credit facilities to fund our current operating needs we cannot be certain that we will be able to replace our existing credit facilities or refinance our existing or future debt when necessary our cost of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by our debt and credit ratings assigned by the major credit rating agencies downgrades in these ratings will increase our cost of borrowing and could have an adverse effect on our access to the capital markets including our access to the commercial paper market an inability to access the capital markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we have goodwill and intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet we periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such value may not be recoverable impairment assessment involves judgment as to assumptions regarding future sales and cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions future events and changing market conditions may impact our assumptions and may result in changes in our estimates of future sales and cash flows that may result in us incurring substantial impairment charges which would adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

we hold investments in equity and debt securities in some of our defined benefit pension plans a decrease in the value of plan assets resulting from a general financial downturn may cause a negative pension plan investment performance which may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

protracted duration of economic downturns in cyclical segments of the economy may depress the demand for some of our products and adversely affect our sales earnings cash flow or financial condition 

portions of our business involve the sale of paint coatings and related products to segments of the economy that are cyclical in nature particularly segments relating to construction housing manufacturing and oil production refining storage and transportation our sales to these segments are affected by the levels of discretionary consumer and business spending in these segments during economic downturns in these segments the levels of consumer and business discretionary spending may decrease and the recovery of these segments may lag behind the recovery of the overall economy this decrease in spending will likely reduce the demand for some of our products and may adversely affect our sales earnings cash flow or financial condition 

during the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 the us homebuilding industry experienced a significant and sustained decrease in demand for new homes and an oversupply of new and existing homes available for sale during this same time period the us real estate industry also experienced a significant decrease in existing home turnover the commercial and industrial building and maintenance sectors also experienced a significant decline the downturn in each of these segments contributed to an unprecedented decline in the demand for some of our products the recovery in new home starts existing home sales and new commercial construction has been sluggish and erratic in many markets and remain below their prerecession highs challenging market conditions are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and may worsen a worsening in these segments will reduce the demand for some of our products and may adversely impact sales earnings and cash flow 

increases in the cost of raw materials and energy may adversely affect our earnings or cash flow 

we purchase raw materials including titanium dioxide and propylene and energy for use in the manufacturing distribution and sale of our products factors such as adverse weather conditions including hurricanes and other disasters can disrupt raw material and fuel supplies and increase our costs although raw materials and energy supplies including oil and natural gas are generally available from various sources in sufficient quantities unexpected shortages and increases in the cost of raw materials and energy or any deterioration in our relationships with or the financial viability of our suppliers may have an adverse effect on our earnings or cash flow in the event we are unable to offset higher costs in a timely manner by sufficiently decreasing our operating costs or raising the prices of our products while we have experienced some easing of the prices of certain raw materials recently raw material pricing has in the past experienced and likely will in the future experience periods of volatility 

although we have an extensive customer base the loss of any of our largest customers could adversely affect our sales earnings or cash flow 

we have a large and varied customer base due to our extensive distribution network during 2015  no individual customer accounted for sales totaling more than ten percent of our sales however we have some customers that individually purchase a 

large amount of products from us although our broad distribution channels help to minimize the impact of the loss of any one customer the loss of any of these large customers could have an adverse effect on our sales earnings or cash flow 

adverse weather conditions may temporarily reduce the demand for some of our products and could have a negative effect on our sales earnings or cash flow 

our business is seasonal in nature with the second and third quarters typically generating a higher proportion of sales and earnings than other quarters from time to time adverse weather conditions in certain parts of the united states have had an adverse effect on our sales of paint coatings and related products for example unusually cold and rainy weather such as that which occurred in certain parts of the united states during the exterior painting season in 2015 could have an adverse effect on sales of our exterior paint products an adverse effect on sales may cause a reduction in our earnings or cash flow 

increased competition may reduce our sales earnings or cash flow performance 

we face substantial competition from many international national regional and local competitors of various sizes in the manufacture distribution and sale of our paint coatings and related products some of our competitors are larger than us and have greater financial resources to compete other competitors are smaller and may be able to offer more specialized products technology product quality product innovation breadth of product line technical expertise distribution service and price are the key competitive factors for our business competition in any of these areas may reduce our sales and adversely affect our earnings or cash flow by resulting in decreased sales volumes reduced prices and increased costs of manufacturing distributing and selling our products 

inability to protect or enforce our material trademarks and other intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our business 

we have numerous patents trade secrets trademarks trade names and knowhow that are valuable to our business despite our efforts to protect such intellectual property and other proprietary information from unauthorized use or disclosure third parties may attempt to disclose obtain or use our trademarks or such other intellectual property and information without our authorization although we rely on the patent trademark trade secret and copyright laws of the united states and other countries to protect our intellectual property rights the laws of some countries may not protect such rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties the failure of foreign countries to have laws to protect our intellectual property rights or an inability to effectively enforce such rights in foreign countries could have an adverse effect on our business 

to service our debt we will require a significant amount of cash our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control we also depend on the business of our subsidiaries to satisfy our cash needs if we cannot generate the required cash we may not be able to make the necessary payments required under our indebtedness 

at december 31 2015  we had total debt of approximately 20 billion  we have the ability under our existing credit facilities to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future our ability to make payments on our debt fund our other liquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future our historical financial results have been and we anticipate that our future financial results will be subject to fluctuations our ability to generate cash to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control we cannot guarantee that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make payments of our debt fund other liquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures additionally any failure to comply with covenants in the instruments governing our debt could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived would have a material adverse effect on us 

a significant portion of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries as a result our ability to generate sufficient cash flow for our needs is dependent to some extent on the earnings of our subsidiaries and the payment of those earnings to us in the form of dividends loans or advances and through repayment of loans or advances from us our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay any amounts due on our debt or to provide us with funds to meet our cash flow needs whether in the form of dividends distributions loans or other payments in addition any payment of dividends loans or advances by our subsidiaries could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions payments to us by our subsidiaries will also be contingent upon our subsidiaries earnings and business considerations our right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiarys creditors including trade creditors in addition even if we are a creditor of any of our subsidiaries our rights as a creditor would be subordinate to any security interest in the assets of our subsidiaries and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries senior to that held by us finally changes in the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may adversely affect the ability of some of our foreign subsidiaries to repatriate funds to us 

our results of operations cash flow or financial condition may be negatively impacted if we do not successfully integrate future acquisitions into our existing operations and if the performance of the businesses we acquire do not meet our expectations 

we have historically made strategic acquisitions of businesses in the paint and coatings industry and will likely acquire additional businesses in the future as part of our longterm growth strategy the success of future acquisitions depends in large part on our ability to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired companies and manage challenges that may arise as a result of the acquisitions particularly when the acquired businesses operate in new or foreign markets in the event that we do not successfully integrate such future acquisitions into our existing operations so as to realize the expected return on our investment our results of operations cash flow or financial condition could be adversely affected 

risks and uncertainties associated with our expansion into and our operations in asia europe south america and other foreign markets could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

net external sales of our consolidated foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately 158  198  and 209  of our total consolidated net sales in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively sales outside of the united states make up a significant part of our current business and future strategic plans our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition could be adversely affected by a variety of international factors including general economic conditions inflation rates recessions foreign currency exchange rates foreign currency exchange controls interest rates foreign investment and repatriation restrictions legal and regulatory constraints civil unrest difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and other external economic and political factors our inability to successfully manage the risks and uncertainties relating to these factors could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

in many foreign countries it is acceptable to engage in certain business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in because of regulations that are applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act although we have internal control policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these regulations there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prevent a violation of these regulations any violation could cause an adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

because of our international operations we are exposed to risk associated with interest rates and value changes in foreign currencies which may adversely affect our business historically our reported net sales earnings cash flow and financial condition have been subjected to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates our primary exchange rate exposure is with the argentine peso the brazilian real the british pound the canadian dollar the chilean peso the euro and the mexican peso each against the us dollar while we actively manage the exposure of our foreign currency risk as part of our overall financial risk management policy we believe we may experience losses from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and such losses could adversely affect our sales earnings cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we are subject to a wide variety of complex domestic and foreign laws rules and regulations for which compliance could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

we are subject to a wide variety of complex domestic and foreign laws rules and regulations and legal compliance risks including securities laws tax laws employment and pensionrelated laws competition laws us and foreign export and trading laws data privacy and security laws and laws governing improper business practices we are affected by new laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations including interpretations by courts and regulators from time to time our company our operations and the industries in which we operate are being reviewed or investigated by regulators which could lead to enforcement actions or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages 

although we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to mitigate these risks the global and diverse nature of our operations means that compliance risks will continue to exist investigations examinations and other proceedings the nature and outcome of which cannot be predicted will likely arise from time to time these investigations examinations and other proceedings could subject us to significant liability and require us to take significant accruals or pay significant settlements fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

we are subject to tax laws and regulations in the united states and multiple foreign jurisdictions we are affected by changes in tax laws and regulations as well as changes in related interpretations and other tax guidance in the ordinary course of our business we are subject to examinations and investigations by various tax authorities in addition to existing examinations and investigations there could be additional examinations and investigations in the future and existing examinations and investigations could be expanded 

for nonincome tax risks we estimate material loss contingencies and accrue for such loss contingencies as required by us generally accepted accounting principles based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency in the event the loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently accrued the recording of the additional liability may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such additional liability is accrued in those cases where no accrual is recorded because it is not probable that a liability has been incurred and cannot be reasonably estimated any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued or paid for income tax risks we recognize tax benefits based on our assessment that a tax benefit has a greater than 50 likelihood of being sustained upon ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant facts for those income tax positions where we assess that there is not a greater than 50 likelihood that such tax benefits will be sustained we do not recognize a tax benefit in our financial statements subsequent events may cause us to change our assessment of the likelihood of sustaining a previouslyrecognized benefit which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial position for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued or paid 

we discuss risks and uncertainties with regard to taxes in more detail in note 14  of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 69  and 70  of our 2015  annual report 

unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential customer employee supplier or company information whether through a breach of our computer systems including cyber attacks or otherwise could severely harm our business 

as part of our business we collect process and retain sensitive and confidential personal information about our customers employees and suppliers despite the security measures we have in place our facilities and systems and those of the retailers dealers licensees and other third party suppliers and vendors with which we do business may be vulnerable to security breaches cyber attacks acts of vandalism or misconduct computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors or other similar events any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer employee supplier or company information whether by us or by the retailers dealers licensees and other third party suppliers and vendors with which we do business could result in losses severely damage our reputation expose us to the risks of litigation and liability disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition as cyber security threats evolve in sophistication and become more prevalent in numerous industries worldwide we continue to increase our sensitivity and attention to these threats and seek additional investments and resources to address these threats and enhance the security of our facilities and systems the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and privacy is increasingly rigorous and complex with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs 

we are required to comply with numerous complex and increasingly stringent domestic and foreign health safety and environmental laws and regulations the cost of which is likely to increase and may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

our operations are subject to various domestic and foreign health safety and environmental laws and regulations these laws and regulations not only govern our current operations and products but also impose potential liability on us for our past operations we expect health safety and environmental laws and regulations to impose increasingly stringent requirements upon our industry and us in the future our costs to comply with these laws and regulations may increase as these requirements become more stringent in the future and these increased costs may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

we are involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of our currently and formerly owned sites as well as a number of thirdparty sites for which our ultimate liability may exceed the current amount we have accrued 

we are involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of our currently and formerly owned sites and a number of thirdparty sites we accrue for estimated costs of investigation and remediation activities at these sites for which commitments or cleanup plans have been developed and when such costs can be reasonably estimated based on industry standards and professional judgment these estimated costs are based on currently available facts regarding each site we continuously assess our potential liability for investigation and remediation activities and adjust our environmentalrelated accruals as information becomes available upon which more accurate costs can be reasonably estimated due to the uncertainties surrounding environmental investigation and remediation activities our liability may result in costs that are significantly higher than currently accrued and may have an adverse effect on our earnings we discuss these risks and 

uncertainties in more detail on page 25  of our 2015  annual report under the caption “environmental matters” page 29  of our 2015  annual report under the caption “environmentalrelated liabilities” and in note 8  of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 60  through 62  of our 2015  annual report 

the nature cost quantity and outcome of pending and future litigation such as litigation arising from the historical manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paint could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity and financial condition 

in the course of our business we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits including but not limited to litigation relating to product liability and warranty personal injury environmental intellectual property commercial contractual and antitrust claims that are inherently subject to many uncertainties regarding the possibility of a loss to us these uncertainties will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur confirming the incurrence of a liability or the reduction of a liability in accordance with the contingencies topic of the asc we accrue for these contingencies by a charge to income when it is both probable that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact of a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated in the event that a loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently accrued the recording of the additional liability may result in a material impact on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such additional liability is accrued in those cases where no accrual is recorded because it is not probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of any such loss cannot be reasonably estimated any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us may result in a material impact on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued in those cases where no accrual is recorded or exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued the contingencies topic of the asc requires disclosure of the contingency when there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or additional loss may have been incurred 

our past operations included the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paints along with other companies we are and have been a defendant in a number of legal proceedings including individual personal injury actions purported class actions and actions brought by various counties cities school districts and other governmentrelated entities arising from the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paints the plaintiffs claims have been based upon various legal theories including negligence strict liability breach of warranty negligent misrepresentations and omissions fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions concert of action civil conspiracy violations of unfair trade practice and consumer protection laws enterprise liability market share liability public nuisance unjust enrichment and other theories the plaintiffs seek various damages and relief including personal injury and property damage costs relating to the detection and abatement of leadbased paint from buildings costs associated with a public education campaign medical monitoring costs and others we have also been a defendant in legal proceedings arising from the manufacture and sale of nonleadbased paints that seek recovery based upon various legal theories including the failure to adequately warn of potential exposure to lead during surface preparation when using nonleadbased paint on surfaces previously painted with leadbased paint we believe that the litigation brought to date is without merit or subject to meritorious defenses and are vigorously defending such litigation we have not settled any material lead pigment or leadbased paint litigation we expect that additional lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation may be filed against us in the future asserting similar or different legal theories and seeking similar or different types of damages and relief 

notwithstanding our views on the merits litigation is inherently subject to many uncertainties and we ultimately may not prevail adverse court rulings such as the courts decision in the santa clara county california proceeding the jury verdict against us and other defendants in the state of rhode island action and the wisconsin state supreme court’s determination that wisconsin’s risk contribution theory may apply in the lead pigment litigation or determinations of liability among other factors could affect the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation against us and encourage an increase in the number and nature of future claims and proceedings in addition from time to time various legislation and administrative regulations have been enacted promulgated or proposed to impose obligations on present and former manufacturers of lead pigments and leadbased paints respecting asserted health concerns associated with such products or to overturn the effect of court decisions in which we and other manufacturers have been successful 

due to the uncertainties involved management is unable to predict the outcome of the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation the number or nature of possible future claims and proceedings or the effect that any legislation andor administrative regulations may have on the litigation or against us in addition management cannot reasonably determine the scope or amount of the potential costs and liabilities related to such litigation or resulting from any such legislation and regulations we have not accrued any amounts for such litigation with respect to such litigation including the public nuisance litigation the company does not believe that it is probable that a loss has occurred and it is not possible to estimate the range of potential losses as there is no prior history of a loss of this nature and there is no substantive information upon which an estimate could be based in addition any potential liability that may result from any changes to legislation and regulations cannot reasonably be estimated in the event any significant liability is determined to be attributable to us relating to such litigation the recording of the liability may result in a material impact on net income for the annual or interim period during 

which such liability is accrued additionally due to the uncertainties associated with the amount of any such liability andor the nature of any other remedy which may be imposed in such litigation any potential liability determined to be attributable to us arising out of such litigation may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition an estimate of the potential impact on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition cannot be made due to the aforementioned uncertainties 

a trial commenced in the santa clara county california proceeding on july 15 2013 and ended on august 22 2013 the court entered final judgment on january 27 2014 finding in favor of the plaintiffs and against the company and two other defendants and holding the company jointly and severally liable with the other two defendants to pay 115 billion into a fund to abate the public nuisance the company has filed a notice of appeal however if the appeal process is unsuccessful at reversing the decision or otherwise reducing the amount of the judgment we and the other defendants will be subject to significant liabilities costs and expenses to abate the public nuisance in on and around residences in the plaintiffs jurisdictions which could encourage an increase in future public nuisance claims and proceedings any adverse court rulings or any determinations of liability against us may result in a material impact on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition 

we discuss the risks and uncertainties related to litigation including the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation in more detail on page 25  of our 2015  annual report under the caption “litigation and other contingent liabilities” and in note 9  of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 62  through 65  of our 2015  annual report

 item 1a risk factors 

the risks described below and in other documents that we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

adverse changes in general business and economic conditions in the united states and worldwide may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

adverse changes in general business and economic conditions in the united states and worldwide may reduce the demand for some of our products and adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition higher inflation rates interest rates tax rates and unemployment rates higher labor and healthcare costs recessions changing governmental policies laws and regulations and other economic factors could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

a weakening or reversal of the general economic recovery in the united states and other countries and regions in which we do business or the continuation or worsening of the economic downturn in other countries and regions may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

global economic uncertainty continues to exist a weakening or reversal of the general economic recovery in the united states and other countries and regions in which we do business or the continuation or worsening of the economic downturn in other countries and regions may adversely impact our net sales the collection of accounts receivable funding for working capital needs expected cash flow generation from current and acquired businesses and our investments which may adversely impact our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we finance a portion of our sales through trade credit credit markets remain tight and some customers who require financing for their businesses have not been able to obtain necessary financing a continuation or worsening of these conditions could limit our ability to collect our accounts receivable which could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we generally fund a portion of our seasonal working capital needs and obtain funding for other general corporate purposes through shortterm borrowings backed by our revolving credit facility and other financing facilities if any of the 

banks in these credit and financing facilities are unable to perform on their commitments which could adversely affect our ability to fund seasonal working capital needs and obtain funding for other general corporate purposes our cash flow liquidity or financial condition could be adversely impacted 

although we currently have available credit facilities to fund our current operating needs we cannot be certain that we will be able to replace our existing credit facilities or refinance our existing or future debt when necessary our cost of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by our debt and credit ratings assigned by the major credit rating agencies downgrades in these ratings will increase our cost of borrowing and could have an adverse effect on our access to the capital markets including our access to the commercial paper market an inability to access the capital markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we have goodwill and intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet we periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such value may not be recoverable impairment assessment involves judgment as to assumptions regarding future sales and cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions future events and changing market conditions may impact our assumptions and may result in changes in our estimates of future sales and cash flows that may result in us incurring substantial impairment charges which would adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

we hold investments in equity and debt securities in some of our defined benefit pension plans a decrease in the value of plan assets resulting from a general financial downturn may cause a negative pension plan investment performance which may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

protracted duration of economic downturns in cyclical segments of the economy may depress the demand for some of our products and adversely affect our sales earnings cash flow or financial condition 

portions of our business involve the sale of paint coatings and related products to segments of the economy that are cyclical in nature particularly segments relating to construction housing and manufacturing our sales to these segments are affected by the levels of discretionary consumer and business spending in these segments during economic downturns in these segments the levels of consumer and business discretionary spending may decrease and the recovery of these segments may lag behind the recovery of the overall economy this decrease in spending will likely reduce the demand for some of our products and may adversely affect our sales earnings cash flow or financial condition 

during the recent recession the us homebuilding industry experienced a significant and sustained decrease in demand for new homes and an oversupply of new and existing homes available for sale during this same time period the us real estate industry also experienced a significant decrease in existing home turnover the commercial and industrial building and maintenance sectors also experienced a significant decline the downturn in each of these segments contributed to an unprecedented decline in the demand for some of our products the recovery in new home starts existing home sales and new commercial construction has been sluggish and erratic in many markets and remain below their prerecession highs challenging market conditions are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and may worsen a worsening in these segments will reduce the demand for some of our products and may adversely impact sales earnings and cash flow 

increases in the cost of raw materials and energy may adversely affect our earnings or cash flow 

we purchase raw materials including titanium dioxide and proplylene and energy for use in the manufacturing distribution and sale of our products factors such as adverse weather conditions including hurricanes and other disasters can disrupt raw material and fuel supplies and increase our costs although raw materials and energy supplies including oil and natural gas are generally available from various sources in sufficient quantities unexpected shortages and increases in the cost of raw materials and energy or any deterioration in our relationships with or the financial viability of our suppliers may have an adverse effect on our earnings or cash flow in the event we are unable to offset higher costs in a timely manner by sufficiently decreasing our operating costs or raising the prices of our products while we have experienced some easing of the prices of certain raw materials recently raw material pricing has in the past and likely will in the future experience periods of volatility 

although we have an extensive customer base the loss of any of our largest customers could adversely affect our sales earnings or cash flow 

we have a large and varied customer base due to our extensive distribution network during 2014  no individual customer accounted for sales totaling more than ten percent of our sales however we have some customers that individually purchase a large amount of products from us although our broad distribution channels help to minimize the impact of the loss of any one customer the loss of any of these large customers could have an adverse effect on our sales earnings or cash flow 

adverse weather conditions may temporarily reduce the demand for some of our products and could have a negative effect on our sales earnings or cash flow 

our business is seasonal in nature with the second and third quarters typically generating a higher proportion of sales and earnings than other quarters from time to time adverse weather conditions in certain parts of the united states have had an adverse effect on our sales of paint coatings and related products for example unusually cold and rainy weather especially during the exterior painting season could have an adverse effect on sales of our exterior paint products an adverse effect on sales may cause a reduction in our earnings or cash flow 

increased competition may reduce our sales earnings or cash flow performance 

we face substantial competition from many international national regional and local competitors of various sizes in the manufacture distribution and sale of our paint coatings and related products some of our competitors are larger than us and have greater financial resources to compete other competitors are smaller and may be able to offer more specialized products technology product quality product innovation breadth of product line technical expertise distribution service and price are the key competitive factors for our business competition in any of these areas may reduce our sales and adversely affect our earnings or cash flow by resulting in decreased sales volumes reduced prices and increased costs of manufacturing distributing and selling our products 

to service our debt we will require a significant amount of cash our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control we also depend on the business of our subsidiaries to satisfy our cash needs if we cannot generate the required cash we may not be able to make the necessary payments required under our indebtedness 

at december 31 2014 we had total debt of approximately 18 billion  we have the ability under our existing credit facilities to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future our ability to make payments on our debt fund our other liquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future our historical financial results have been and we anticipate that our future financial results will be subject to fluctuations our ability to generate cash to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make payments of our debt fund other liquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures additionally any failure to comply with covenants in the instruments governing our debt could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived would have a material adverse effect on us 

a significant portion of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries as a result our ability to generate sufficient cash flow for our needs is dependent to some extent on the earnings of our subsidiaries and the payment of those earnings to us in the form of dividends loans or advances and through repayment of loans or advances from us our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay any amounts due on our debt or to provide us with funds to meet our cash flow needs whether in the form of dividends distributions loans or other payments in addition any payment of dividends loans or advances by our subsidiaries could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions payments to us by our subsidiaries will also be contingent upon our subsidiaries earnings and business considerations our right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiarys creditors including trade creditors in addition even if we are a creditor of any of our subsidiaries our rights as a creditor would be subordinate to any security interest in the assets of our subsidiaries and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries senior to that held by us finally changes in the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may adversely affect the ability of some of our foreign subsidiaries to repatriate funds to us 

our results of operations cash flow or financial condition may be negatively impacted if we do not successfully integrate past and future acquisitions into our existing operations and if the performance of the businesses we acquire do not meet our expectations 

we have historically made strategic acquisitions of businesses in the paint and coatings industry and will likely acquire additional businesses in the future as part of our longterm growth strategy in 2013 we acquired the comex business in the united states and canada this acquisition involves challenges and risks in the event that we do not continue to successfully integrate the comex acquisition into our existing operations so as to realize the expected return on our investment our results of operations cash flow or financial condition could be adversely affected 

risks and uncertainties associated with our expansion into and our operations in asia europe south america and other foreign markets could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

net external sales of our consolidated foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately 198 209 and 215 of our total consolidated net sales in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively sales outside of the united states make up a significant part of our current business and future strategic plans our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition could be adversely affected by a variety of international factors including general economic conditions inflation rates recessions foreign currency exchange rates foreign currency exchange controls interest rates foreign investment and repatriation restrictions legal and regulatory constraints civil unrest difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and other 

external economic and political factors our inability to successfully manage the risks and uncertainties relating to these factors could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

in many foreign countries it is acceptable to engage in certain business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in because of regulations that are applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act although we have internal control policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these regulations there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prevent a violation of these regulations any violation could cause an adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

because of our international operations we are exposed to risk associated with interest rates and value changes in foreign currencies which may adversely affect our business historically our reported net sales earnings cash flow and financial condition have been subjected to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates our primary exchange rate exposure is with the euro the british pound the argentine peso the brazilian real the chilean peso the canadian dollar and the mexican peso against the us dollar while we actively manage the exposure of our foreign currency risk as part of our overall financial risk management policy we believe we may experience losses from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and such losses could adversely affect our sales earnings cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we are subject to a wide variety of complex domestic and foreign laws and regulations for which compliance could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

we are subject to a wide variety of complex domestic and foreign laws and regulations and legal compliance risks including securities laws tax laws employment and pensionrelated laws competition laws us and foreign export and trading laws and laws governing improper business practices we are affected by new laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations including interpretations by courts and regulators from time to time our company our operations and the industries in which we operate are being reviewed or investigated by regulators which could lead to enforcement actions or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages 

although we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to mitigate these risks the global and diverse nature of our operations means that compliance risks will continue to exist investigations examinations and other proceedings the nature and outcome of which cannot be predicted will likely arise from time to time these investigations examinations and other proceedings could subject us to significant liability and require us to take significant accruals or pay significant settlements fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

we are subject to tax laws and regulations in the united states and multiple foreign jurisdictions we are affected by changes in tax laws and regulations as well as changes in related interpretations and other tax guidance in the ordinary course of our business we are subject to examinations and investigations by various tax authorities in addition to existing examinations and investigations there could be additional examinations and investigations in the future and existing examinations and investigations could be expanded 

for nonincome tax risks we estimate material loss contingencies and accrue for such loss contingencies as required by us generally accepted accounting principles based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency in the event the loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently accrued the recording of the additional liability may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such additional liability is accrued in those cases where no accrual is recorded because it is not probable that a liability has been incurred and cannot be reasonably estimated any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued or paid for income tax risks we recognize tax benefits based on our assessment that a tax benefit has a greater than 50 likelihood of being sustained upon ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant facts for those income tax positions where we assess that there is not a greater than 50 likelihood that such tax benefits will be sustained we do not recognize a tax benefit in our financial statements subsequent events may cause us to change our assessment of the likelihood of sustaining a previouslyrecognized benefit which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial position for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued or paid 

we discuss risks and uncertainties with regard to taxes in more detail in note 14  of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 68  and 69  of our 2014  annual report 

unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential customer employee supplier or company information whether through a breach of our computer systems including cyber attacks or otherwise could severely harm our business 

as part of our business we collect process and retain sensitive and confidential personal information about our customers employees and suppliers despite the security measures we have in place our facilities and systems and those of the retailers dealers licensees and other third party distributors with which we do business may be vulnerable to security breaches cyber attacks acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors or other similar events any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer employee supplier or company information whether by us or by the retailers dealers licensees and other third party distributors with which we do business could result in losses severely damage our reputation expose us to the risks of litigation and liability disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and privacy is increasingly rigorous with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs 

we are required to comply with numerous complex and increasingly stringent domestic and foreign health safety and environmental laws and regulations the cost of which is likely to increase and may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

our operations are subject to various domestic and foreign health safety and environmental laws and regulations these laws and regulations not only govern our current operations and products but also impose potential liability on us for our past operations we expect health safety and environmental laws and regulations to impose increasingly stringent requirements upon our industry and us in the future our costs to comply with these laws and regulations may increase as these requirements become more stringent in the future and these increased costs may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

we are involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of our currently and formerly owned sites as well as a number of thirdparty sites for which our ultimate liability may exceed the current amount we have accrued 

we are involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of our currently and formerly owned sites and a number of thirdparty sites we accrue for estimated costs of investigation and remediation activities at these sites for which commitments or cleanup plans have been developed and when such costs can be reasonably estimated based on industry standards and professional judgment these estimated costs are based on currently available facts regarding each site we continuously assess our potential liability for investigation and remediation activities and adjust our environmentalrelated accruals as information becomes available upon which more accurate costs can be reasonably estimated due to the uncertainties surrounding environmental investigation and remediation activities our liability may result in costs that are significantly higher than currently accrued and may have an adverse effect on our earnings we discuss these risks and uncertainties in more detail on page 23  of our 2014  annual report under the caption “environmental matters” page 27  of our 2014  annual report under the caption “environmentalrelated liabilities” and in note 8  of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 58  through 60  of our 2014  annual report 

the nature cost quantity and outcome of pending and future litigation such as litigation arising from the historical manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paint could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity and financial condition 

in the course of our business we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits including but not limited to litigation relating to product liability and warranty personal injury environmental intellectual property commercial contractual and antitrust claims that are inherently subject to many uncertainties regarding the possibility of a loss to us these uncertainties will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur confirming the incurrence of a liability or the reduction of a liability in accordance with the contingencies topic of the asc we accrue for these contingencies by a charge to income when it is both probable that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact of a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated in the event that a loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently accrued the recording of the additional liability may result in a material impact on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such additional liability is accrued in those cases where no accrual is recorded because it is not probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of any such loss cannot be reasonably estimated any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us may result in a material impact on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued in those cases where no accrual is recorded or exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued the contingencies topic of the asc requires disclosure of the contingency when there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or additional loss may have been incurred 

our past operations included the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paints along with other companies we are and have been a defendant in a number of legal proceedings including individual personal injury actions purported class actions and actions brought by various counties cities school districts and other governmentrelated entities arising from the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paints the plaintiffs claims have been based upon various legal theories including negligence strict liability breach of warranty negligent misrepresentations and omissions fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions concert of action civil conspiracy violations of unfair trade practice and consumer protection laws enterprise liability market share liability public nuisance unjust enrichment and other theories the plaintiffs seek various damages and relief including personal injury and property damage costs relating to the detection and abatement of leadbased paint from buildings costs associated with a public education campaign medical monitoring costs and others we have also been a defendant in legal proceedings arising from the manufacture and sale of nonleadbased paints that seek recovery based upon various legal theories including the failure to adequately warn of potential exposure to lead during surface preparation when using nonleadbased paint on surfaces previously painted with leadbased paint we believe that the litigation brought to date is without merit or subject to meritorious defenses and are vigorously defending such litigation we have not settled any material lead pigment or leadbased paint litigation we expect that additional lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation may be filed against us in the future asserting similar or different legal theories and seeking similar or different types of damages and relief 

notwithstanding our views on the merits litigation is inherently subject to many uncertainties and we ultimately may not prevail adverse court rulings such as the courts decision in the santa clara county california proceeding the jury verdict against us and other defendants in the state of rhode island action and the wisconsin state supreme court’s determination that wisconsin’s risk contribution theory may apply in the lead pigment litigation or determinations of liability among other factors could affect the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation against us and encourage an increase in the number and nature of future claims and proceedings in addition from time to time various legislation and administrative regulations have been enacted promulgated or proposed to impose obligations on present and former manufacturers of lead pigments and leadbased paints respecting asserted health concerns associated with such products or to overturn the effect of court decisions in which we and other manufacturers have been successful 

due to the uncertainties involved management is unable to predict the outcome of the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation the number or nature of possible future claims and proceedings or the effect that any legislation andor administrative regulations may have on the litigation or against us in addition management cannot reasonably determine the scope or amount of the potential costs and liabilities related to such litigation or resulting from any such legislation and regulations we have not accrued any amounts for such litigation with respect to such litigation including the public nuisance litigation the company does not believe that it is probable that a loss has occurred and it is not possible to estimate the range of potential losses as there is no prior history of a loss of this nature and there is no substantive information upon which an estimate could be based in addition any potential liability that may result from any changes to legislation and regulations cannot reasonably be estimated in the event any significant liability is determined to be attributable to us relating to such litigation the recording of the liability may result in a material impact on net income for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued additionally due to the uncertainties associated with the amount of any such liability andor the nature of any other remedy which may be imposed in such litigation any potential liability determined to be attributable to us arising out of such litigation may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial 

condition an estimate of the potential impact on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition cannot be made due to the aforementioned uncertainties 

a trial commenced in the santa clara county california proceeding on july 15 2013 and ended on august 22 2013 the court entered final judgment on january 27 2014 finding in favor of the plaintiffs and against the company and two other defendants and holding the company jointly and severally liable with the other two defendants to pay 115 billion into a fund to abate the public nuisance the company has filed a notice of appeal however if the appeal process is unsuccessful at reversing the decision or otherwise reducing the amount of the judgment we and the other defendants will be subject to significant liabilities costs and expenses to abate the public nuisance in on and around residences in the plaintiffs jurisdictions which could encourage an increase in future public nuisance claims and proceedings any adverse court rulings or any determinations of liability against us may result in a material impact on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition 

we discuss the risks and uncertainties related to litigation including the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation in more detail on page 23  of our 2014  annual report under the caption “litigation and other contingent liabilities” and pages 29  and 30  of our 2014  annual report under the caption “litigation” of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and in note 9  of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 60   through 63  of our 2014  annual report

basis of reportable segments 

we report our segment information in the same way that management internally organizes our business for assessing performance and making decisions regarding allocation of resources in accordance with the segment reporting topic of the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification asc we have four reportable operating segments paint stores group consumer group global finishes group and latin america coatings group individually a reportable segment and collectively the “reportable segments” factors considered in determining our reportable segments include the nature of business activities the management structure directly accountable to the company’s chief operating decision maker codm for operating and administrative activities availability of discrete financial information and information presented to our board of directors we report all other business activities and immaterial operating segments that are not reportable in the administrative segment for more information about the reportable segments see pages 6  through 15  of our 2013  annual report which is incorporated herein by reference 

the company’s codm has been identified as the chief executive officer because he has final authority over performance assessment and resource allocation decisions because of the diverse operations of the company the codm regularly receives discrete financial information about each reportable segment as well as a significant amount of additional financial information about certain divisions business units or subsidiaries of the company the codm uses all such financial information for performance assessment and resource allocation decisions the codm evaluates the performance of and allocates resources to the reportable segments based on profit or loss before income taxes and cash generated from operations the accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in note 1  of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 48  through 51  of our 2013  annual report which is incorporated herein by reference

administrative segment 

the administrative segment includes the administrative expenses of the company’s corporate headquarters site also included in the administrative segment was interest expense interest and investment income certain expenses related to closed facilities and environmentalrelated matters and other expenses which were not directly associated with the reportable segments the administrative segment did not include any significant foreign operations also included in the administrative segment was a real estate management unit that is responsible for the ownership management and leasing of nonretail properties held primarily for use by the company including the company’s headquarters site and disposal of idle facilities sales of this segment represented external leasing revenue of excess headquarters space or leasing of facilities no longer used

raw materials and products purchased for resale 

we believe we generally have adequate sources of raw materials and fuel supplies used in our business however consolidation of raw material suppliers and a reduction in raw material manufacturing capacity during the recent recession along with an increase in global demand for certain raw materials resulted in increased prices of certain raw materials in 2013  a continued increase in global demand for certain raw materials and coatings as the global economy recovers may result in increased prices of certain raw materials for the reportable segments during 2014  there are sufficient suppliers of each product purchased for resale that none of the reportable segments anticipate any significant sourcing problems during 2014  see item 1a risk factors for more information regarding cost and sourcing of raw materials 

seasonality 

the majority of the sales for the reportable segments traditionally occur during the second and third quarters there is no significant seasonality in sales for the administrative segment 

working capital 

in order to meet increased demand during the second and third quarters the company usually builds its inventories during the first quarter working capital items inventories and accounts receivable are generally financed through shortterm borrowings which include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of commercial paper for a description of the company’s liquidity and capital resources see pages 24  through 34  of our 2013  annual report under the caption “financial condition liquidity and cash flow” of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” which is incorporated herein by reference 

trademarks and trade names 

customer recognition of our trademarks and trade names collectively contribute significantly to our sales the major trademarks and trade names used by each of the reportable segments are set forth below 

 3 

 patents 

although patents and licenses are not of material importance to our business as a whole or any segment the global finishes group and latin america coatings group derive a portion of their income from the licensing of technology trademarks and trade names to foreign companies 

backlog and productive capacity 

backlog orders are not significant in the business of any reportable segment since there is normally a short period of time between the placing of an order and shipment we believe that sufficient productive capacity currently exists to fulfill our needs for paint coatings and related products through 2014  

research and development 

for information regarding our costs of research and development included in technical expenditures see note 1  of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 50  and 51  of our 2013  annual report which is incorporated herein by reference

 item 1a risk factors 

described below and elsewhere in this report and other documents that we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission are risks uncertainties and other factors that can adversely affect our business results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

adverse changes in general business and economic conditions in the united states and worldwide may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

adverse changes in general business and economic conditions in the united states and worldwide may reduce the demand for some of our products and adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition higher inflation rates interest rates tax rates and unemployment rates higher labor and healthcare costs recessions changing governmental policies laws and regulations and other economic factors could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

a weakening or reversal of the general economic recovery in the united states and other countries and regions in which we do business or the continuation or worsening of the economic downturn in other countries and regions may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

global economic uncertainty continues to exist a weakening or reversal of the general economic recovery in the united states and other countries and regions in which we do business or the continuation or worsening of the economic downturn in other countries and regions may adversely impact our net sales the collection of accounts receivable funding for working 

capital needs expected cash flow generation from current and acquired businesses and our investments which may adversely impact our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we finance a portion of our sales through trade credit credit markets remain tight and some customers who require financing for their businesses have not been able to obtain necessary financing a continuation or worsening of these conditions could limit our ability to collect our accounts receivable which could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we generally fund a portion of our seasonal working capital needs and obtain funding for other general corporate purposes through shortterm borrowings backed by our revolving credit facility and other financing facilities if any of the banks in these credit and financing facilities are unable to perform on their commitments which could adversely affect our ability to fund seasonal working capital needs and obtain funding for other general corporate purposes our cash flow liquidity or financial condition could be adversely impacted 

although we currently have available credit facilities to fund our current operating needs we cannot be certain that we will be able to replace our existing credit facilities or refinance our existing or future debt when necessary our cost of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by our debt and credit ratings assigned by the major credit rating agencies downgrades in these ratings will increase our cost of borrowing and could have an adverse effect on our access to the capital markets including our access to the commercial paper market an inability to access the capital markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we have goodwill and intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet we periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such value may not be recoverable impairment assessment involves judgment as to assumptions regarding future sales and cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions future events and changing market conditions may impact our assumptions and may result in changes in our estimates of future sales and cash flows that may result in us incurring substantial impairment charges which would adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

we hold investments in equity and debt securities in some of our defined benefit pension plans a decrease in the value of plan assets resulting from a general financial downturn may cause a negative pension plan investment performance which may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

protracted duration of economic downturns in cyclical segments of the economy may depress the demand for some of our products and adversely affect our sales earnings cash flow or financial condition 

portions of our business involve the sale of paint coatings and related products to segments of the economy that are cyclical in nature particularly segments relating to construction housing and manufacturing our sales to these segments are affected by the levels of discretionary consumer and business spending in these segments during economic downturns in these segments the levels of consumer and business discretionary spending may decrease and the recovery of these segments may lag behind the recovery of the overall economy this decrease in spending will likely reduce the demand for some of our products and may adversely affect our sales earnings cash flow or financial condition 

during the recent recession the us homebuilding industry experienced a significant and sustained decrease in demand for new homes and an oversupply of new and existing homes available for sale during this same time period the us real estate industry also experienced a significant decrease in existing home turnover the commercial and industrial building and maintenance sectors also experienced a significant decline the downturn in each of these segments contributed to an unprecedented decline in the demand for some of our products the recovery in new home starts existing home sales and new commercial construction has been sluggish and erratic in many markets and remain below their prerecession highs challenging market conditions are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and may worsen a worsening in these segments will reduce the demand for some of our products and may adversely impact sales earnings and cash flow 

increases in the cost of raw materials and energy may adversely affect our earnings or cash flow 

we purchase raw materials including titanium dioxide and proplylene and energy for use in the manufacturing distribution and sale of our products factors such as adverse weather conditions including hurricanes and other disasters can disrupt raw material and fuel supplies and increase our costs in addition many raw material suppliers decreased manufacturing capacity during the recent recession continued economic recovery has caused and may continue to cause demand pressure on raw material supplies the decrease in manufacturing capacity along with strong global demand for certain raw materials has caused and may continue to cause tight supplies and significant price increases especially in titanium dioxide and petrochemicals which are key ingredients used in the manufacture of paint and coatings although raw materials and energy supplies including oil and natural gas are generally available from various sources in sufficient quantities unexpected shortages and increases in the cost of raw materials and energy or any deterioration in our relationships with or the financial viability of our suppliers may have an adverse effect on our earnings or cash flow in the event we are unable to offset higher 

costs in a timely manner by sufficiently decreasing our operating costs or raising the prices of our products while we have experienced some easing of the prices of certain raw materials recently raw material pricing has in the past and likely will in the future experience periods of volatility 

although we have an extensive customer base the loss of any of our largest customers could adversely affect our sales earnings or cash flow 

we have a large and varied customer base due to our extensive distribution network during 2013  no individual customer accounted for sales totaling more than ten percent of our sales however we have some customers that individually purchase a large amount of products from us although our broad distribution channels help to minimize the impact of the loss of any one customer the loss of any of these large customers could have an adverse effect on our sales earnings or cash flow 

adverse weather conditions may temporarily reduce the demand for some of our products and could have a negative effect on our sales earnings or cash flow 

from time to time adverse weather conditions in certain parts of the united states have had an adverse effect on our sales of paint coatings and related products for example unusually cold and rainy weather especially during the exterior painting season could have an adverse effect on sales of our exterior paint products an adverse effect on sales may cause a reduction in our earnings or cash flow 

increased competition may reduce our sales earnings or cash flow performance 

we face substantial competition from many international national regional and local competitors of various sizes in the manufacture distribution and sale of our paint coatings and related products some of our competitors are larger than us and have greater financial resources to compete other competitors are smaller and may be able to offer more specialized products technology product quality product innovation breadth of product line technical expertise distribution service and price are the key competitive factors for our business competition in any of these areas may reduce our sales and adversely affect our earnings or cash flow by resulting in decreased sales volumes reduced prices and increased costs of manufacturing distributing and selling our products 

our pending acquisition of the comex business in mexico may not occur which may negatively affect the trading prices of our stock and our future business and financial results 

on november 9 2012 we and sherwinwilliams caribbean nv one of our wholly owned subsidiaries entered into a definitive stock purchase agreement to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of consorcio comex sa de cv and conaxe sa de cv for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 234 billion in cash including assumed debt founded in 1952 comex is a privately held business with operations in latin america and at the time in the united states and canada in 2011 comex had total annual sales of approximately us 14 billion 

on july 17 2013 the federal competition commission of mexico the fcc informed us that the acquisition of the comex business in mexico was not authorized and a subsequent appeal to the fcc was also denied on october 29 2013 in the meantime on september 16 2013 we completed the acquisition of the comex business in the united states and canada also on september 16 2013 the stock purchase agreement for the purchase of the comex business in mexico was amended and restated to extend the date by which the agreement can be terminated by either party to march 31 2014 and to reflect a revised purchase price of approximately 225 billion 

the closing of the pending acquisition of the comex business in mexico remains subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions including among others the consent waiver or authorization of the federal economic competition commission completion of the acquisition is not assured and there is no assurance that it will be completed the acquisition is subject to risks and uncertainties including the risk that the necessary regulatory approvals are not obtained or that other closing conditions are not satisfied if the acquisition is not completed or if there are significant delays in completing the acquisition it could negatively affect the trading prices of our common stock and our future business and financial results 

our obligation to complete the pending acquisition of the comex business in mexico is not subject to a financing condition 

  our obligation to complete the pending acquisition of the comex business in mexico is not subject to a financing condition in december 2012 we incurred 1 billion of indebtedness by issuing senior notes due 2017 and 2042 a portion of which we plan to use to pay part of the purchase price of the acquisition we also plan to pay part of the purchase price of the acquisition by borrowing through existing credit facilities and other financing facilities which we may refinance by issuing additional longterm debt in the future if any of the banks in these credit and financing facilities are unable to perform their commitments we may be required to finance a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition at interest rates higher than currently expected if we are unable to borrow the necessary funds to complete the acquisition or if we are not otherwise able to pay the purchase price we may not be able to complete the acquisition and will be in breach of the purchase agreement 

we may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies of the pending acquisition of the comex business in mexico at all or in the expected time frame 

the success of the pending acquisition of the comex business in mexico will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies from combining and integrating the comex business with our existing business during a challenging global economic environment we may not be able to achieve expected objectives or may not able to achieve these objectives on a timely basis and the anticipated benefits and synergies therefore may not be realized fully or at all 

the acquisition involves challenges and risks including risks that the transaction does not advance our business strategy or that we will not realize a satisfactory return the challenges include among others i the diversion of the attention of management and other employees to integration matters ii difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings synergies business opportunities and growth prospects from combining the business of comex with our existing business iii difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a larger and more complex company with an expanded presence in latin america iv challenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers and v challenges in retaining key employees and integrating a workforce while maintaining focus on providing high quality customer service any integration difficulties could decrease or eliminate the anticipated benefits and synergies of the acquisition and could negatively affect the trading prices of our stock and our future business and financial results 

to service our debt we will require a significant amount of cash our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control we also depend on the business of our subsidiaries to satisfy our cash needs if we cannot generate the required cash we may not be able to make the necessary payments required under our indebtedness 

at december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 we had total debt of approximately 17 billion  a significant increase over our total debt of approximately 990 million at december 31 2011 we have the ability under our existing credit facilities to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future and we plan to incur significant additional indebtedness in the event we complete the pending acquisition of the comex business in mexico our ability to make payments on our debt fund our other liquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future our historical financial results have been and we anticipate that our future financial results will be subject to fluctuations our ability to generate cash to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make payments of our debt fund our other liquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures 

the degree to which we are currently leveraged and will be leveraged following the completion of the pending acquisition of the comex business in mexico could have important consequences to shareholders for example it could 

 additionally any failure to comply with covenants in the instruments governing our debt could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived would have a material adverse effect on us 

a significant portion of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries as a result our ability to generate sufficient cash flow for our needs is dependent to some extent on the earnings of our subsidiaries and the payment of those earnings to us in the form of dividends loans or advances and through repayment of loans or advances from us our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay any amounts due on our debt or to provide us with funds to meet our cash flow needs whether in the form of dividends distributions loans or other payments in addition any payment of dividends loans or advances by our subsidiaries could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions payments to us by our subsidiaries will also be contingent upon our subsidiaries earnings and business considerations our right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiarys creditors including trade creditors in addition even if we are a creditor of any of our subsidiaries our rights as a creditor would be subordinate to any security interest in the assets of our subsidiaries and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries senior to that held by us finally changes in the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may adversely affect the ability of some of our foreign subsidiaries to repatriate funds to us 

our results of operations cash flow or financial condition may be negatively impacted if we do not successfully integrate past and future acquisitions into our existing operations and if the performance of the businesses we acquire do not meet our expectations 

we have historically made strategic acquisitions of businesses in the paint and coatings industry and will likely acquire additional businesses in the future as part of our longterm growth strategy in 2012 we acquired geocel holdings corporation which manufactures innovative caulks sealants and adhesives specially designed for tough construction and repair applications in commercial residential industrial and transport nonautomotive markets geocel has operations in both the united states and united kingdom in 2012 we also acquired jiangsu pulanna coating co ltd a leading automotive refinishes coatings manufacturer in china in 2013 we acquired the comex business in the united states and canada these acquisitions along with the pending acquisition of the comex business in mexico involve challenges and risks in the event that we do not successfully integrate these acquisitions into our existing operations so as to realize the expected return on our investment our results of operations cash flow or financial condition could be adversely affected 

risks and uncertainties associated with our expansion into and our operations in asia europe mexico south america and other foreign markets could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

net external sales of our consolidated foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately 209 215 and 226 of our total consolidated net sales in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively this percentage is expected to increase in 2014 in the event we complete the pending acquisition of the comex business in mexico sales outside of the united states make up a growing and significant part of our current business and future strategic plans our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition could be adversely affected by a variety of international factors including general economic conditions inflation rates recessions foreign currency exchange rates foreign currency exchange controls interest rates foreign investment and repatriation restrictions legal and regulatory constraints civil unrest difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and other external economic and political factors our inability to successfully manage the risks and uncertainties relating to these factors could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

in many foreign countries it is acceptable to engage in certain business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in because of regulations that are applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act although we have internal control policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these regulations there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prevent a violation of these regulations any violation could cause an adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

because of our international operations we are exposed to risk associated with interest rates and value changes in foreign currencies which may adversely affect our business historically our reported net sales earnings cash flow and financial condition have been subjected to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates our primary exchange rate exposure is with the euro the british pound the argentine peso the brazilian real the chilean peso the canadian dollar and the mexican peso against the us dollar while we actively manage the exposure of our foreign currency risk as part of our overall financial risk management policy we believe we may experience losses from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and such losses could adversely affect our sales earnings cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we are subject to a wide variety of complex domestic and foreign laws and regulations for which compliance could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

we are subject to a wide variety of complex domestic and foreign laws and regulations and legal compliance risks including securities laws tax laws employment and pensionrelated laws competition laws us and foreign export and trading laws and laws governing improper business practices we are affected by new laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations including interpretations by courts and regulators from time to time our company our operations and the industries in which we operate are being reviewed or investigated by regulators which could lead to enforcement actions or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages 

although we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to mitigate these risks the global and diverse nature of our operations means that compliance risks will continue to exist investigations examinations and other proceedings the nature and outcome of which cannot be predicted will likely arise from time to time these investigations examinations and other proceedings could subject us to significant liability and require us to take significant accruals or pay significant settlements fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

we are subject to tax laws and regulations in the united states and multiple foreign jurisdictions we are affected by changes in tax laws and regulations as well as changes in related interpretations and other tax guidance in the ordinary course 

of our business we are subject to examinations and investigations by various tax authorities in addition to existing examinations and investigations there could be additional examinations and investigations in the future and existing examinations and investigations could be expanded 

for nonincome tax risks we estimate material loss contingencies and accrue for such loss contingencies as required by us generally accepted accounting principles based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency in the event the loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently accrued the recording of the additional liability may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such additional liability is accrued in those cases where no accrual is recorded because it is not probable that a liability has been incurred and cannot be reasonably estimated any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued or paid for income tax risks we recognize tax benefits based on our assessment that a tax benefit has a greater than 50 likelihood of being sustained upon ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant facts for those income tax positions where we assess that there is not a greater than 50 likelihood that such tax benefits will be sustained we do not recognize a tax benefit in our financial statements subsequent events may cause us to change our assessment of the likelihood of sustaining a previouslyrecognized benefit which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial position for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued or paid 

we discuss risks and uncertainties with regard to taxes in more detail in note 14  of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 70  and 71  of our 2013  annual report 

unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential customer employee supplier or company information whether through a breach of our computer systems including cyber attacks or otherwise could severely harm our business 

as part of our business we collect process and retain sensitive and confidential personal information about our customers employees and suppliers despite the security measures we have in place our facilities and systems and those of the retailers dealers licensees and other third party distributors with which we do business may be vulnerable to security breaches cyber attacks acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors or other similar events any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer employee supplier or company information whether by us or by the retailers dealers licensees and other third party distributors with which we do business could result in losses severely damage our reputation expose us to the risks of litigation and liability disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and privacy is increasingly rigorous with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs 

we are required to comply with numerous complex and increasingly stringent domestic and foreign health safety and environmental laws and regulations the cost of which is likely to increase and may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

our operations are subject to various domestic and foreign health safety and environmental laws and regulations these laws and regulations not only govern our current operations and products but also impose potential liability on us for our past operations we expect health safety and environmental laws and regulations to impose increasingly stringent requirements upon our industry and us in the future our costs to comply with these laws and regulations may increase as these requirements become more stringent in the future and these increased costs may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

we are involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of our currently and formerly owned sites as well as a number of thirdparty sites for which our ultimate liability may exceed the current amount we have accrued 

we are involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of our currently and formerly owned sites and a number of thirdparty sites we accrue for estimated costs of investigation and remediation activities at these sites for which commitments or cleanup plans have been developed and when such costs can be reasonably estimated based on industry standards and professional judgment these estimated costs are based on currently available facts regarding each site we continuously assess our potential liability for investigation and remediation activities and adjust our environmentalrelated accruals as information becomes available upon which more accurate costs can be reasonably estimated due to the uncertainties surrounding environmental investigation and remediation activities our liability may result in costs that are significantly higher than currently accrued and may have an adverse affect on our earnings we discuss these risks and 

uncertainties in more detail on page 23  of our 2013  annual report under the caption “environmental matters” pages 27  and 29  of our 2013  annual report under the caption “environmentalrelated liabilities” and in note 8  of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 62  and 63  of our 2013  annual report 

the nature cost quantity and outcome of pending and future litigation such as litigation arising from the historical manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paint could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity and financial condition 

in the course of our business we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits including litigation relating to product liability and warranty personal injury environmental intellectual property commercial contractual and antitrust claims that are inherently subject to many uncertainties regarding the possibility of a loss to us these uncertainties will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur confirming the incurrence of a liability or the reduction of a liability in accordance with the contingencies topic of the asc we accrue for these contingencies by a charge to income when it is both probable that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact of a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated in the event that a loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently accrued the recording of the additional liability may result in a material impact on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such additional liability is accrued in those cases where no accrual is recorded because it is not probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of any such loss cannot be reasonably estimated any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us may result in a material impact on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued in those cases where no accrual is recorded or exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued the contingencies topic of the asc requires disclosure of the contingency when there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or additional loss may have been incurred even if the possibility may be remote 

our past operations included the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paints along with other companies we are a defendant in a number of legal proceedings including individual personal injury actions purported class actions and actions brought by various counties cities school districts and other governmentrelated entities arising from the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paints the plaintiffs are seeking recovery based upon various legal theories including negligence strict liability breach of warranty negligent misrepresentations and omissions fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions concert of action civil conspiracy violations of unfair trade practice and consumer protection laws enterprise liability market share liability public nuisance unjust enrichment and other theories the plaintiffs seek various damages and relief including personal injury and property damage costs relating to the detection and abatement of leadbased paint from buildings costs associated with a public education campaign medical monitoring costs and others we are also a defendant in legal proceedings arising from the manufacture and sale of nonleadbased paints which seek recovery based upon various legal theories including the failure to adequately warn of potential exposure to lead during surface preparation when using nonleadbased paint on surfaces previously painted with leadbased paint we believe that the litigation brought to date is without merit or subject to meritorious defenses and are vigorously defending such litigation we expect that additional lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation may be filed against us in the future asserting similar or different legal theories and seeking similar or different types of damages and relief 

notwithstanding our views on the merits litigation is inherently subject to many uncertainties and we ultimately may not prevail adverse court rulings such as the courts decision in the santa clara county california proceeding the jury verdict against us and other defendants in the state of rhode island action and the wisconsin state supreme court’s determination that wisconsin’s risk contribution theory may apply in the lead pigment litigation or determinations of liability among other factors could affect the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation against us and encourage an increase in the number and nature of future claims and proceedings in addition from time to time various legislation and administrative regulations have been enacted promulgated or proposed to impose obligations on present and former manufacturers of lead pigments and leadbased paints respecting asserted health concerns associated with such products or to overturn the effect of court decisions in which we and other manufacturers have been successful 

due to the uncertainties involved management is unable to predict the outcome of the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation the number or nature of possible future claims and proceedings or the effect that any legislation andor administrative regulations may have on the litigation or against us in addition management cannot reasonably determine the scope or amount of the potential costs and liabilities related to such litigation or any such legislation and regulations we have not accrued any amounts for such litigation with respect to such litigation including the public nuisance litigation the company does not believe that it is probable that a loss has occurred and it is not possible to estimate the range of potential losses as there is no prior history of a loss of this nature and there is no substantive information upon which an estimate could be based in addition any potential liability that may result from such legislation and regulations cannot reasonably be estimated in the event any significant liability is determined to be attributable to us relating to such litigation the recording of the liability may result in a material impact on net income for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued additionally due to the uncertainties associated with the amount of any such liability andor the nature of any other 

remedy which may be imposed in such litigation any potential liability determined to be attributable to us arising out of such litigation may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition an estimate of the potential impact on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition cannot be made due to the aforementioned uncertainties 

a trial commenced in the santa clara county california proceeding on july 15 2013 and ended on august 22 2013 the court entered final judgment on january 27 2014 finding in favor of the plaintiffs and against the company and two other defendants and holding the company jointly and severally liable with the other two defendants to pay 115 billion into a fund to abate the public nuisance the company has filed a motion for new trial and a motion to vacate the judgment and will file a notice of appeal at the appropriate time however if the appeal process is unsuccessful at reversing the decision or otherwise reducing the amount of the judgment we and the other defendants will be subject to significant liabilities costs and expenses to abate the public nuisance in on and around residences in the plaintiffs jurisdictions and could encourage an increase in future public nuisance claims and proceedings any adverse court rulings or any determinations of liability against us may result in a material impact on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition 

we discuss the risks and uncertainties related to litigation including the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation in more detail on page 23  of our 2013  annual report under the caption “litigation and other contingent liabilities” and pages 31  through 34  of our 2013  annual report under the caption “litigation” of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and in note 9  of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 63   through 66  of our 2013  annual report 

the costs or potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us due to our ownership of life shield could have an adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we own life shield engineered systems llc which ceased operations in 2012 life shield developed and manufactured blast and fragment mitigating systems the blast and fragment mitigating systems create a potentially higher level of product liability for us than is normally associated with coatings and related products we manufacture distribute and sell depending upon the extent of any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us relating to life shield such liability could have an adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition we discuss these risks and uncertainties in more detail on page 31  of our 2013  annual report under the caption “contingent liabilities” of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations”

for additional information regarding our business and business developments see pages 6  through 15  of our 2012  annual report and the “letter to shareholders” on pages 2  through 5  of our 2012  annual report which is incorporated herein by reference 

raw materials and products purchased for resale 

we believe we generally have adequate sources of raw materials and fuel supplies used in our business however consolidation of raw material suppliers and a reduction in raw material manufacturing capacity during the recent recession along with an increase in global demand for certain raw materials resulted in increased prices of certain raw materials in 2012  a continued increase in global demand for certain raw materials and coatings as the global economy recovers may result in increased prices of certain raw materials for the reportable segments during 2013  there are sufficient suppliers of each product purchased for resale that none of the reportable segments anticipate any significant sourcing problems during 2013  see item 1a risk factors for more information regarding cost and sourcing of raw materials 

seasonality 

the majority of the sales for the reportable segments traditionally occur during the second and third quarters there is no significant seasonality in sales for the administrative segment 

working capital 

in order to meet increased demand during the second and third quarters the company usually builds its inventories during the first quarter working capital items inventories and accounts receivable are generally financed through shortterm borrowings which include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of commercial paper for a description of the company’s liquidity and capital resources see pages 24  through 34  of our 2012  annual report under the caption “financial condition liquidity and cash flow” of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” which is incorporated herein by reference 

trademarks and trade names 

customer recognition of our trademarks and trade names collectively contribute significantly to our sales the major trademarks and trade names used by each of the reportable segments are set forth below 

 3 

patents 

although patents and licenses are not of material importance to our business as a whole or any segment the global finishes group and latin america coatings group derive a portion of their income from the licensing of technology trademarks and trade names to foreign companies 

backlog and productive capacity 

backlog orders are not significant in the business of any reportable segment since there is normally a short period of time between the placing of an order and shipment we believe that sufficient productive capacity currently exists to fulfill our needs for paint coatings and related products through 2013  

research and development 

for information regarding our costs of research and development included in technical expenditures see note 1  of the notes to consolidated financial statements on page 51  of our 2012  annual report which is incorporated herein by reference

 item 1a risk factors 

described below and elsewhere in this report and other documents that we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission are risks uncertainties and other factors that can adversely affect our business results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

adverse changes in general business and economic conditions in the united states and worldwide may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

adverse changes in general business and economic conditions in the united states and worldwide may reduce the demand for some of our products and adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition higher inflation rates interest rates tax rates and unemployment rates higher labor and healthcare costs recessions changing governmental policies laws and regulations and other economic factors could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

the duration and severity of global economic and financial conditions may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

a worsening of global economic and financial conditions may adversely impact our net sales the collection of accounts receivable funding for working capital needs expected cash flow generation from current and acquired businesses and our investments which may adversely impact our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we finance a portion of our sales through trade credit the current global economic and financial conditions have caused some customers to be less profitable and have increased our exposure to credit risk in addition due to the tightening of credit markets some customers who require financing for their businesses have not been able to obtain necessary financing continuation of these conditions could limit our ability to collect our accounts receivable which could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we generally fund a portion of our seasonal working capital needs and obtain funding for other general corporate purposes through shortterm borrowings backed by our revolving credit facility and other financing facilities if any of the banks in these credit and financing facilities are unable to perform on their commitments which could adversely affect our ability to fund seasonal working capital needs and obtain funding for other general corporate purposes our cash flow liquidity or financial condition could be adversely impacted 

although we currently have available credit facilities to fund our current operating needs we cannot be certain that we will be able to replace our existing credit facilities or refinance our existing or future debt when necessary our cost of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by our debt and credit ratings assigned by the major credit rating agencies downgrades in these ratings will increase our cost of borrowing and could have an adverse effect on our access to the capital markets including our access to the commercial paper market an inability to access the capital markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we have goodwill and intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet we periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such value may not be recoverable impairment assessment involves judgment as to assumptions regarding future sales and cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions future events and changing market conditions may impact our assumptions and may result in changes in our estimates of future sales and cash flows that may result in us incurring substantial impairment charges which would adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

we hold investments in equity and debt securities in some of our defined benefit pension plans a decrease in the value of plan assets resulting from a general financial downturn may cause a negative pension plan investment performance which may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

protracted duration of economic downturns in cyclical segments of the economy may continue to depress the demand for some of our products and adversely affect our sales earnings cash flow or financial condition 

portions of our business involve the sale of paint coatings and related products to segments of the economy that are cyclical in nature particularly segments relating to construction housing and manufacturing our sales to these segments are affected by the levels of discretionary consumer and business spending in these segments during economic downturns in these segments the levels of consumer and business discretionary spending may decrease and the recovery of these segments may lag behind the recovery of the overall economy this decrease in spending will likely reduce the demand for some of our products and may adversely affect our sales earnings cash flow or financial condition 

during the recent recession the us homebuilding industry experienced a significant and sustained decrease in demand for new homes and an oversupply of new and existing homes available for sale during this same time period the us real estate industry also experienced a significant decrease in existing home turnover the commercial and industrial building and maintenance sectors also experienced a significant decline the downturn in each of these segments contributed to an unprecedented decline in the demand for some of our products new home starts existing home sales and new commercial construction are significantly below their prerecession highs although many of our end markets have started to show signs of stabilization and modest improvement the recovery has been erratic and challenging market conditions are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and may worsen a worsening in these segments will continue to reduce the demand for some of our products and may adversely impact sales earnings and cash flow 

increases in the cost of raw materials and energy may adversely affect our earnings or cash flow 

we purchase raw materials and energy for use in the manufacturing distribution and sale of our products factors such as adverse weather conditions including hurricanes and other disasters can disrupt raw material and fuel supplies and increase our costs in addition many raw material suppliers decreased manufacturing capacity during the recent recession continued economic recovery has caused and may continue to cause demand pressure on raw material supplies the decrease in manufacturing capacity along with strong global demand for certain raw materials has caused and may continue to cause tight supplies and significant price increases especially in titanium dioxide and petrochemicals which are key ingredients used in the manufacture of paint and coatings although raw materials and energy supplies including oil and natural gas are generally available from various sources in sufficient quantities unexpected shortages and increases in the cost of raw materials and energy or any deterioration in our relationships with or the financial viability of our suppliers may have an adverse effect on our earnings or cash flow in the event we are unable to offset higher costs in a timely manner by sufficiently decreasing our operating costs or raising the prices of our products many of our paint and coatings products utilize oil based derivatives minerals including titanium dioxide and metals while we have experienced some easing of the prices of certain raw materials recently raw material pricing has in the past and likely will in the future experience periods of volatility 

although we have an extensive customer base the loss of any of our largest customers could adversely affect our sales earnings or cash flow 

we have a large and varied customer base due to our extensive distribution network during 2012  no individual customer accounted for sales totaling more than ten percent of our sales however we have some customers that individually purchase a large amount of products from us although our broad distribution channels help to minimize the impact of the loss of any one customer the loss of any of these large customers could have an adverse effect on our sales earnings or cash flow 

adverse weather conditions may temporarily reduce the demand for some of our products and could have a negative effect on our sales earnings or cash flow 

from time to time adverse weather conditions in certain parts of the united states have had an adverse effect on our sales of paint coatings and related products for example unusually cold and rainy weather especially during the exterior painting season could have an adverse effect on sales of our exterior paint products an adverse effect on sales may cause a reduction in our earnings or cash flow 

increased competition may reduce our sales earnings or cash flow performance 

we face substantial competition from many international national regional and local competitors of various sizes in the manufacture distribution and sale of our paint coatings and related products some of our competitors are larger than us and have greater financial resources to compete other competitors are smaller and may be able to offer more specialized products technology product quality product innovation breadth of product line technical expertise distribution service and price are the key competitive factors for our business competition in any of these areas may reduce our sales and adversely affect our earnings or cash flow by resulting in decreased sales volumes reduced prices and increased costs of manufacturing distributing and selling our products 

our planned acquisition of comex may not occur at all or may not occur in the expected time frame which may negatively affect the trading prices of our stock and our future business and financial results 

on november 9 2012 we and sherwinwilliams caribbean nv one of our wholly owned subsidiaries entered into a definitive stock purchase agreement to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of consorcio comex sa de cv and conaxe sa de cv for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 234 billion in cash including assumed debt founded in 1952 comex is a privately held business with operations in latin america the united states and canada in 2011 comex had total annual sales of approximately us 14 billion 

completion of the planned acquisition of comex is not assured and there is no assurance that it will be completed the closing of the acquisition is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions including among others the consent waiver or authorization of the federal antitrust commission of mexico and the national commission of foreign investments of mexico both of which are under review the acquisition is subject to risks and uncertainties including the risk that the necessary regulatory approvals are not obtained or that other closing conditions are not satisfied if the acquisition is not completed or if there are significant delays in completing the acquisition it could negatively affect the trading prices of our common stock and our future business and financial results 

our obligation to complete the comex acquisition is not subject to a financing condition 

  our obligation to complete the comex acquisition is not subject to a financing condition in december 2012 we incurred 1 billion of indebtedness by issuing senior notes due 2017 and 2042 a portion of which we plan to use to pay part of the purchase price of the acquisition we also plan to pay part of the purchase price of the acquisition by borrowing through existing credit facilities and other financing facilities which we may refinance by issuing additional longterm debt in the future if any of the banks in these credit and financing facilities are unable to perform their commitments we may be required to finance a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition at interest rates higher than currently expected if we are unable to borrow the necessary funds to complete the acquisition or if we are not otherwise able to pay the purchase price we may not be able to complete the acquisition and will be in breach of the purchase agreement 

we may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies of the comex acquisition at all or in the expected time frame 

the success of the comex acquisition will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies from combining and integrating the comex business with our existing business during a challenging global economic environment we may not be able to achieve expected objectives or may not able to achieve these objectives on a timely basis and the anticipated benefits and synergies therefore may not be realized fully or at all 

the acquisition involves challenges and risks including risks that the transaction does not advance our business strategy or that we will not realize a satisfactory return the challenges include among others i the diversion of the attention of management and other employees to integration matters ii difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings synergies 

business opportunities and growth prospects from combining the business of comex with our existing business iii difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a larger and more complex company with an expanded presence in latin america iv challenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers and v challenges in retaining key employees and integrating a workforce while maintaining focus on providing high quality customer service any integration difficulties could decrease or eliminate the anticipated benefits and synergies of the acquisition and could negatively affect the trading prices of our stock and our future business and financial results 

to service our debt we will require a significant amount of cash our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control we also depend on the business of our subsidiaries to satisfy our cash needs if we cannot generate the required cash we may not be able to make the necessary payments required under our indebtedness 

at december 31 2012 we had total debt of approximately 17 billion  a significant increase over our total debt of approximately 990 million at december 31 2011 we have the ability under our existing credit facilities to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future and we plan to incur significant additional indebtedness in the event we complete the comex acquisition our ability to make payments on our debt fund our other liquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future our historical financial results have been and we anticipate that our future financial results will be subject to fluctuations our ability to generate cash to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make payments of our debt fund our other liquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures 

the degree to which we are currently leveraged and will be leveraged following the completion of the comex acquisition could have important consequences to shareholders for example it could 

•  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 

•  increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions 

•  limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future to enable us to react to changes in our business or 

•  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to businesses in our industry that have less debt 

additionally any failure to comply with covenants in the instruments governing our debt could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived would have a material adverse effect on us 

a significant portion of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries as a result our ability to generate sufficient cash flow for our needs is dependent to some extent on the earnings of our subsidiaries and the payment of those earnings to us in the form of dividends loans or advances and through repayment of loans or advances from us our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay any amounts due on our debt or to provide us with funds to meet our cash flow needs whether in the form of dividends distributions loans or other payments in addition any payment of dividends loans or advances by our subsidiaries could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions payments to us by our subsidiaries will also be contingent upon our subsidiaries earnings and business considerations our right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiarys creditors including trade creditors in addition even if we are a creditor of any of our subsidiaries our rights as a creditor would be subordinate to any security interest in the assets of our subsidiaries and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries senior to that held by us finally changes in the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may adversely affect the ability of some of our foreign subsidiaries to repatriate funds to us 

our results of operations cash flow or financial condition may be negatively impacted if we do not successfully integrate past and future acquisitions into our existing operations and if the performance of the businesses we acquire do not meet our expectations 

we have historically made strategic acquisitions of businesses in the paint and coatings industry and will likely acquire additional businesses in the future as part of our longterm growth strategy in 2011 we acquired leighs paints a leading industrial fire protection coatings manufacturer headquartered in the united kingdom in 2012 we acquired geocel holdings corporation which manufactures innovative caulks sealants and adhesives specially designed for tough construction and repair applications in commercial residential industrial and transport nonautomotive markets geocel has operations in both the united states and united kingdom in 2012 we also acquired jiangsu pulanna coating co ltd a leading automotive refinishes coatings manufacturer in china these acquisitions along with the comex acquisition involve challenges and risks in the event that we do not successfully integrate these acquisitions into our existing operations so as to realize the expected return on our investment our results of operations cash flow or financial condition could be adversely affected 

risks and uncertainties associated with our expansion into and our operations in asia europe mexico south america and other foreign markets could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

net external sales of our consolidated foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately 215 226 and 189 of our total consolidated net sales in 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively this percentage is expected to increase in 2013 in the event we complete the comex acquisition sales outside of the united states make up a growing and significant part of our current business and future strategic plans our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition could be adversely affected by a variety of international factors including general economic conditions inflation rates recessions foreign currency exchange rates foreign currency exchange controls interest rates foreign investment and repatriation restrictions legal and regulatory constraints civil unrest difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and other external economic and political factors our inability to successfully manage the risks and uncertainties relating to these factors could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

in many foreign countries it is acceptable to engage in certain business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in because of regulations that are applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act although we have internal control policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these regulations there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prevent a violation of these regulations any violation could cause an adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

because of our international operations we are exposed to risk associated with interest rates and value changes in foreign currencies which may adversely affect our business historically our reported net sales earnings cash flow and financial condition have been subjected to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates our primary exchange rate exposure is with the euro the british pound the argentine peso the brazilian real the chilean peso the canadian dollar and the mexican peso against the us dollar while we actively manage the exposure of our foreign currency risk as part of our overall financial risk management policy we believe we may experience losses from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and such losses could adversely affect our sales earnings cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we are subject to a wide variety of complex domestic and foreign laws and regulations for which compliance could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

we are subject to a wide variety of complex domestic and foreign laws and regulations and legal compliance risks including securities laws tax laws employment and pensionrelated laws competition laws us and foreign export and trading laws and laws governing improper business practices we are affected by new laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations including interpretations by courts and regulators from time to time our company our operations and the industries in which we operate are being reviewed or investigated by regulators which could lead to enforcement actions or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages 

although we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to mitigate these risks the global and diverse nature of our operations means that compliance risks will continue to exist investigations examinations and other proceedings the nature and outcome of which cannot be predicted will likely arise from time to time these investigations examinations and other proceedings could subject us to significant liability and require us to take significant accruals or pay significant settlements fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

we are subject to tax laws and regulations in the united states and multiple foreign jurisdictions we are affected by changes in tax laws and regulations as well as changes in related interpretations and other tax guidance in the ordinary course of our business we are subject to examinations and investigations by various tax authorities in addition to existing examinations and investigations there could be additional examinations and investigations in the future and existing examinations and investigations could be expanded 

for nonincome tax risks we estimate material loss contingencies and accrue for such loss contingencies as required by us generally accepted accounting principles based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency in the event the loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently accrued the recording of the additional liability may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such additional liability is accrued in those cases where no accrual is recorded because it is not probable that a liability has been incurred and cannot be reasonably estimated any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued or paid for income tax risks we recognize tax benefits based on our assessment that a tax benefit has a greater than 

50 likelihood of being sustained upon ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant facts for those income tax positions where we assess that there is not a greater than 50 likelihood that such tax benefits will be sustained we do not recognize a tax benefit in our financial statements subsequent events may cause us to change our assessment of the likelihood of sustaining a previouslyrecognized benefit which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial position for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued or paid 

we discuss risks and uncertainties with regard to taxes in more detail in note 14  of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 71  and 72  of our 2012  annual report 

we are required to comply with numerous complex and increasingly stringent domestic and foreign health safety and environmental laws and regulations the cost of which is likely to increase and may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

our operations are subject to various domestic and foreign health safety and environmental laws and regulations these laws and regulations not only govern our current operations and products but also impose potential liability on us for our past operations we expect health safety and environmental laws and regulations to impose increasingly stringent requirements upon our industry and us in the future our costs to comply with these laws and regulations may increase as these requirements become more stringent in the future and these increased costs may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

we are involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of our currently and formerly owned sites as well as a number of thirdparty sites for which our ultimate liability may exceed the current amount we have accrued 

we are involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of our currently and formerly owned sites and a number of thirdparty sites we accrue for estimated costs of investigation and remediation activities at these sites for which commitments or cleanup plans have been developed and when such costs can be reasonably estimated based on industry standards and professional judgment these estimated costs are based on currently available facts regarding each site we continuously assess our potential liability for investigation and remediation activities and adjust our environmentalrelated accruals as information becomes available upon which more accurate costs can be reasonably estimated due to the uncertainties surrounding environmental investigation and remediation activities our liability may result in costs that are significantly higher than currently accrued and may have an adverse affect on our earnings we discuss these risks and uncertainties in more detail on page 23  of our 2012  annual report under the caption “environmental matters” pages 27  and 29  of our 2012  annual report under the caption “environmentalrelated liabilities” and in note 8  of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 63  and 64  of our 2012  annual report 

the nature cost quantity and outcome of pending and future litigation such as litigation arising from the historical manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paint could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity and financial condition 

in the course of our business we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits including litigation relating to product liability and warranty personal injury environmental intellectual property commercial contractual and antitrust claims that are inherently subject to many uncertainties regarding the possibility of a loss to us these uncertainties will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur confirming the incurrence of a liability or the reduction of a liability in accordance with the contingencies topic of the asc we accrue for these contingencies by a charge to income when it is both probable that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact of a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated in the event that a loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently accrued the recording of the additional liability may result in a material impact on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such additional liability is accrued in those cases where no accrual is recorded because it is not probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of any such loss cannot be reasonably estimated any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us may result in a material impact on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued in those cases where no accrual is recorded or exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued the contingencies topic of the asc requires disclosure of the contingency when there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or additional loss may have been incurred even if the possibility may be remote 

our past operations included the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paints along with other companies we are a defendant in a number of legal proceedings including individual personal injury actions purported class actions and actions brought by various counties cities school districts and other governmentrelated entities arising from the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paints the plaintiffs are seeking recovery based upon various legal theories including negligence strict liability breach of warranty negligent misrepresentations and omissions fraudulent 

misrepresentations and omissions concert of action civil conspiracy violations of unfair trade practice and consumer protection laws enterprise liability market share liability public nuisance unjust enrichment and other theories the plaintiffs seek various damages and relief including personal injury and property damage costs relating to the detection and abatement of leadbased paint from buildings costs associated with a public education campaign medical monitoring costs and others we are also a defendant in legal proceedings arising from the manufacture and sale of nonleadbased paints which seek recovery based upon various legal theories including the failure to adequately warn of potential exposure to lead during surface preparation when using nonleadbased paint on surfaces previously painted with leadbased paint we believe that the litigation brought to date is without merit or subject to meritorious defenses and are vigorously defending such litigation we expect that additional lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation may be filed against us in the future asserting similar or different legal theories and seeking similar or different types of damages and relief 

notwithstanding our views on the merits litigation is inherently subject to many uncertainties and we ultimately may not prevail adverse court rulings such as the jury verdict against us and other defendants in the state of rhode island action and the wisconsin state supreme court’s determination that wisconsin’s risk contribution theory may apply in the lead pigment litigation or determinations of liability among other factors could affect the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation against us and encourage an increase in the number and nature of future claims and proceedings in addition from time to time various legislation and administrative regulations have been enacted promulgated or proposed to impose obligations on present and former manufacturers of lead pigments and leadbased paints respecting asserted health concerns associated with such products or to overturn the effect of court decisions in which we and other manufacturers have been successful 

due to the uncertainties involved management is unable to predict the outcome of the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation the number or nature of possible future claims and proceedings or the effect that any legislation andor administrative regulations may have on the litigation or against us in addition management cannot reasonably determine the scope or amount of the potential costs and liabilities related to such litigation or any such legislation and regulations we have not accrued any amounts for such litigation with respect to such litigation including the public nuisance litigation the company does not believe that it is probable that a loss has occurred and it is not possible to estimate the range of potential losses as there is no prior history of a loss of this nature and there is no substantive information upon which an estimate could be based in addition any potential liability that may result from such legislation and regulations cannot reasonably be estimated in the event any significant liability is determined to be attributable to us relating to such litigation the recording of the liability may result in a material impact on net income for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued additionally due to the uncertainties associated with the amount of any such liability andor the nature of any other remedy which may be imposed in such litigation any potential liability determined to be attributable to us arising out of such litigation may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition an estimate of the potential impact on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition cannot be made due to the aforementioned uncertainties 

the santa clara county california proceeding is currently scheduled for trial in june 2013 the sole remaining claim in the proceeding is for public nuisance and the plaintiffs seek the abatement of the alleged public nuisance that exists within the plaintiffs jurisdictions adverse court rulings or a determination of liability against us in the santa clara county california proceeding could subject us and the other defendants to significant liabilities costs and expenses to abate the presence of lead products for use in paint and coatings in on and around buildings in the plaintiffs jurisdictions and could encourage an increase in future public nuisance claims and proceedings any adverse court rulings or any determinations of liability against us may result in a material impact on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition 

we discuss the risks and uncertainties related to litigation including the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation in more detail on page 23  of our 2012  annual report under the caption “litigation and other contingent liabilities” and pages 31  through 34  of our 2012  annual report under the caption “litigation” of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and in note 9  of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 64   through 67  of our 2012  annual report 

the costs or potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us due to our ownership of life shield could have an adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we own life shield engineered systems llc which ceased operations in 2012 life shield developed and manufactured blast and fragment mitigating systems the blast and fragment mitigating systems create a potentially higher level of product liability for us than is normally associated with coatings and related products we manufacture distribute and sell depending upon the extent of any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us relating to life shield such liability could have an adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition we discuss these risks and uncertainties in more detail on pages 30  and 31  of our 2012  annual report under the caption “contingent liabilities” of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations”

raw materials and products purchased for resale 

we believe we generally have adequate sources of raw materials and fuel supplies used in our business however consolidation of raw material suppliers and a reduction in raw material manufacturing capacity during the recent recession along with an increase in global demand for certain raw materials resulted in increased prices of certain raw materials in 2011 a continued increase in global demand for certain raw materials and coatings as the global economy recovers may result in increased prices of certain raw materials for the reportable segments during 2012 there are sufficient suppliers of each product purchased for resale that none of the reportable segments anticipate any significant sourcing problems during 2012 see item 1a risk factors for more information regarding cost and sourcing of raw materials 

seasonality 

the majority of the sales for the reportable segments traditionally occur during the second and third quarters there is no significant seasonality in sales for the administrative segment 

working capital 

in order to meet increased demand during the second and third quarters the company usually builds its inventories during the first quarter working capital items inventories and accounts receivable are generally financed through shortterm borrowings which include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of commercial paper for a description of the company’s liquidity and capital resources see pages 24 through 34 of our 2011 annual report under the caption “financial condition liquidity and cash flow” of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” which is incorporated herein by reference

customer recognition of our trademarks and trade names collectively contribute significantly to our sales the major trademarks and trade names used by each of the reportable segments are set forth below 

 

  

  

   

  

 patents 

although patents and licenses are not of material importance to our business as a whole or any segment the global finishes group and latin america coatings group derive a portion of their income from the licensing of technology trademarks and trade names to foreign companies 

backlog and productive capacity 

backlog orders are not significant in the business of any reportable segment since there is normally a short period of time between the placing of an order and shipment we believe that sufficient productive capacity currently exists to fulfill our needs for paint coatings and related products through 2012

 item 1a risk factors 

described below and elsewhere in this report and other documents that we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission are risks uncertainties and other factors that can adversely affect our business results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

adverse changes in general business and economic conditions in the united states and worldwide may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

adverse changes in general business and economic conditions in the united states and worldwide may reduce the demand for some of our products and adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition higher inflation rates interest rates tax rates and unemployment rates higher labor and healthcare costs recessions changing governmental policies laws and regulations and other economic factors that adversely affect the demand for our paint coatings and related products could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

the duration and severity of global economic and financial conditions may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

a worsening of global economic and financial conditions may adversely impact our net sales the collection of accounts receivable funding for working capital needs expected cash flow generation from current and acquired businesses and our investments which may adversely impact our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we finance a portion of our sales through trade credit the current global economic and financial conditions have caused some customers to be less profitable and have increased our exposure to credit risk in addition due to the tightening of credit markets some customers who require financing for their businesses have not been able to obtain necessary financing continuation of these conditions could limit our ability to collect our accounts receivable which could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we generally fund a portion of our seasonal working capital needs and obtain funding for other general corporate purposes through shortterm borrowings backed by our revolving credit facility and other financing facilities if any of the banks in these credit and financing facilities are unable to perform on their commitments which could adversely affect our ability to fund seasonal working capital needs and obtain funding for other general corporate purposes our cash flow liquidity or financial condition could be adversely impacted 

  

  

although we currently have available credit facilities to fund our current operating needs we cannot be certain that we will be able to replace our existing credit facilities or refinance our existing debt when necessary our cost of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by our debt and credit ratings assigned by the major credit rating agencies downgrades in these ratings will increase our cost of borrowing and could have an adverse effect on our access to the capital markets including our access to the commercial paper market an inability to access the capital markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we have goodwill and intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet we periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such value may not be recoverable impairment assessment involves judgment as to assumptions regarding future sales and cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions future events and changing market conditions may impact our assumptions and may result in changes in our estimates of future sales and cash flows that may result in us incurring substantial impairment charges which would adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

we hold investments in equity and debt securities in some of our defined benefit pension plans a decrease in the value of plan assets resulting from a general financial downturn may cause a negative pension plan investment performance which may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

protracted duration of economic downturns in cyclical segments of the economy may continue to depress the demand for some of our products and adversely affect our sales earnings cash flow or financial condition 

portions of our business involve the sale of paint coatings and related products to segments of the economy that are cyclical in nature particularly segments relating to construction housing and manufacturing our sales to these segments are affected by the levels of discretionary consumer and business spending in these segments during economic downturns in these segments the levels of consumer and business discretionary spending may decrease and the recovery of these segments may lag behind the recovery of the overall economy this decrease in spending will likely reduce the demand for some of our products and may adversely affect our sales earnings cash flow or financial condition 

during the recent recession the us homebuilding industry experienced a significant and sustained decrease in demand for new homes and an oversupply of new and existing homes available for sale during this same time period the us real estate industry also experienced a significant decrease in existing home turnover the commercial and industrial building and maintenance sectors also began to experience a significant decline in 2008 the downturn in each of these segments contributed to an unprecedented decline in the demand for some of our products and has continued to adversely affect our sales and earnings new home starts existing home sales and new commercial construction are significantly below their prerecession highs although many of our end markets have started to show signs of stabilization and modest improvement challenging market conditions are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and may worsen a continued downturn or worsening in these segments will continue to reduce the demand for some of our products and may adversely impact sales earnings and cash flow 

increases in the cost of raw materials and energy may adversely affect our earnings or cash flow 

we purchase raw materials and energy for use in the manufacturing distribution and sale of our products factors such as adverse weather conditions including hurricanes and other disasters can disrupt raw material and fuel supplies and increase our costs in addition many raw material suppliers decreased manufacturing capacity during the recent recession continued economic recovery has caused and may continue to cause demand pressure on raw material supplies the decrease in manufacturing capacity along with strong global demand for certain raw materials has caused and may continue to cause tight supplies and significant price increases especially in titanium dioxide and petrochemicals which are key ingredients used in the manufacture of paint and coatings although raw materials and energy supplies including oil and natural gas are generally 

  

available from various sources in sufficient quantities unexpected shortages and increases in the cost of raw materials and energy or any deterioration in our relationships with or the financial viability of our suppliers may have an adverse effect on our earnings or cash flow in the event we are unable to offset higher costs in a timely manner by sufficiently decreasing our operating costs or raising the prices of our products many of our paint and coatings products utilize oil based derivatives minerals including titanium dioxide and metals 

although we have an extensive customer base the loss of any of our largest customers could adversely affect our sales earnings or cash flow 

we have a large and varied customer base due to our extensive distribution network during 2011 no individual customer accounted for sales totaling more than ten percent of our sales however we have some customers that individually purchase a large amount of products from us although our broad distribution channels would help to minimize the impact of the loss of any one customer the loss of any of these large customers could have an adverse effect on our sales earnings or cash flow 

adverse weather conditions may temporarily reduce the demand for some of our products and could have a negative effect on our sales earnings or cash flow 

from time to time adverse weather conditions in certain parts of the united states have had an adverse effect on our sales of paint coatings and related products for example unusually cold and rainy weather especially during the exterior painting season could have an adverse effect on sales of our exterior paint products an adverse effect on sales may cause a reduction in our earnings or cash flow 

increased competition may reduce our sales earnings or cash flow performance 

we face substantial competition from many international national regional and local competitors of various sizes in the manufacture distribution and sale of our paint coatings and related products some of our competitors are larger than us and have greater financial resources to compete other competitors are smaller and may be able to offer more specialized products technology product quality product innovation breadth of product line technical expertise distribution service and price are the key competitive factors for our business competition in any of these areas may reduce our sales and adversely affect our earnings or cash flow by resulting in decreased sales volumes reduced prices and increased costs of manufacturing distributing and selling our products 

our results of operations cash flow or financial condition may be negatively impacted if we do not successfully integrate past and future acquisitions into our existing operations and if the performance of the businesses we acquire do not meet our expectations 

we have historically made strategic acquisitions of businesses in the paint and coatings industry and will likely acquire additional businesses in the future as part of our longterm growth strategy in 2010 we acquired two industrial wood coatings businesses sayerlack and becker acroma with significant operations in europe and pinturas condor the largest paint and coatings company in ecuador in 2011 we acquired leighs paints a leading industrial fire protection coatings manufacturer headquartered in the united kingdom these acquisitions involve challenges and risks in the event that we do not successfully integrate these acquisitions into our existing operations so as to realize the expected return on our investment our results of operations cash flow or financial condition could be adversely affected 

risks and uncertainties associated with our expansion into and our operations in asia europe mexico south america and other foreign markets could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

net external sales of our consolidated foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately 198 billion in 2011 or 226 of our total consolidated net sales sales outside of the united states make up a growing and important part of our current business and future strategic plans our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial 

  

condition could be adversely affected by a variety of international factors including general economic conditions inflation rates recessions foreign currency exchange rates foreign currency exchange controls interest rates foreign investment and repatriation restrictions legal and regulatory constraints civil unrest difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and other external economic and political factors our inability to successfully manage the risks and uncertainties relating to these factors could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

in many foreign countries it is acceptable to engage in certain business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in because of regulations that are applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act although we have internal control policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these regulations there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prevent a violation of these regulations any violation could cause an adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

because of our international operations we are exposed to risk associated with interest rates and value changes in foreign currencies which may adversely affect our business historically our reported net sales earnings cash flow and financial condition have been subjected to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates our primary exchange rate exposure is with the euro the british pound the argentine peso the brazilian real the chilean peso the canadian dollar and the mexican peso against the us dollar while we actively manage the exposure of our foreign currency risk as part of our overall financial risk management policy we believe we may experience losses from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and such losses could adversely affect our sales earnings cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we are subject to a wide variety of complex domestic and foreign laws and regulations for which compliance could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

we are subject to a wide variety of complex domestic and foreign laws and regulations and legal compliance risks including securities laws tax laws employment and pensionrelated laws competition laws us and foreign export and trading laws and laws governing improper business practices we are affected by new laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations including interpretations by courts and regulators from time to time our company our operations and the industries in which we operate are being reviewed or investigated by regulators which could lead to enforcement actions or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages 

although we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to mitigate these risks the global and diverse nature of our operations means that compliance risks will continue to exist investigations examinations and other proceedings the nature and outcome of which cannot be predicted will likely arise from time to time these investigations examinations and other proceedings could subject us to significant liability and require us to take significant accruals or pay significant settlements fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

we are subject to tax laws and regulations in the united states and multiple foreign jurisdictions we are affected by changes in tax laws and regulations as well as changes in related interpretations and other tax guidance in the ordinary course of our business we are subject to examinations and investigations by various tax authorities in addition to existing examinations and investigations there could be additional examinations and investigations in the future and existing examinations and investigations could be expanded 

for nonincome tax risks we estimate material loss contingencies and accrue for such loss contingencies as required by us generally accepted accounting principles based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency in the event the loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently 

  

accrued the recording of the additional liability may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such additional liability is accrued in those cases where no accrual is recorded because it is not probable that a liability has been incurred and cannot be reasonably estimated any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued or paid for income tax risks we recognize tax benefits based on our assessment that a tax benefit has a greater than 50 likelihood of being sustained upon ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant facts for those income tax positions where we assess that there is not a greater than 50 likelihood that such tax benefits will be sustained we do not recognize a tax benefit in our financial statements subsequent events may cause us to change our assessment of the likelihood of sustaining a previouslyrecognized benefit which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial position for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued or paid 

we discuss risks and uncertainties with regard to taxes in more detail in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 73 and 74 of our 2011 annual report 

we are required to comply with numerous complex and increasingly stringent domestic and foreign health safety and environmental laws and regulations the cost of which is likely to increase and may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

our operations are subject to various domestic and foreign health safety and environmental laws and regulations these laws and regulations not only govern our current operations and products but also impose potential liability on us for our past operations we expect health safety and environmental laws and regulations to impose increasingly stringent requirements upon our industry and us in the future our costs to comply with these laws and regulations may increase as these requirements become more stringent in the future and these increased costs may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

we are involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of our currently and formerly owned sites as well as a number of thirdparty sites for which our ultimate liability may exceed the current amount we have accrued 

we are involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of our currently and formerly owned sites and a number of thirdparty sites we accrue for estimated costs of investigation and remediation activities at these sites for which commitments or cleanup plans have been developed and when such costs can be reasonably estimated based on industry standards and professional judgment these estimated costs are based on currently available facts regarding each site we continuously assess our potential liability for investigation and remediation activities and adjust our environmentalrelated accruals as information becomes available upon which more accurate costs can be reasonably estimated due to the uncertainties surrounding environmental investigation and remediation activities our liability may result in costs that are significantly higher than currently accrued and may have an adverse affect on our earnings we discuss these risks and uncertainties in more detail on page 23 of our 2011 annual report under the caption “environmental matters” pages 27 through 29 of our 2011 annual report under the caption “environmentalrelated liabilities” and in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 65 and 66 of our 2011 annual report 

the nature cost quantity and outcome of pending and future litigation such as litigation arising from the historical manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paint could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity and financial condition 

in the course of our business we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits including litigation relating to product liability and warranty personal injury environmental intellectual property commercial contractual and antitrust claims that are inherently subject to many uncertainties regarding the possibility of a loss to us these uncertainties will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur confirming the incurrence of a liability or the reduction of a liability in accordance with the contingencies topic of the 

  

asc we accrue for these contingencies by a charge to income when it is both probable that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact of a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated in the event that a loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently accrued the recording of the additional liability may result in a material impact on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such additional liability is accrued in those cases where no accrual is recorded because it is not probable that a liability has been incurred and cannot be reasonably estimated any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us may result in a material impact on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued in those cases where no accrual is recorded or exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued the contingencies topic of the asc requires disclosure of the contingency when there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or additional loss may have been incurred even if the possibility may be remote 

our past operations included the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paints along with other companies we are a defendant in a number of legal proceedings including individual personal injury actions purported class actions and actions brought by various counties cities school districts and other governmentrelated entities arising from the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paints the plaintiffs are seeking recovery based upon various legal theories including negligence strict liability breach of warranty negligent misrepresentations and omissions fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions concert of action civil conspiracy violations of unfair trade practice and consumer protection laws enterprise liability market share liability public nuisance unjust enrichment and other theories the plaintiffs seek various damages and relief including personal injury and property damage costs relating to the detection and abatement of leadbased paint from buildings costs associated with a public education campaign medical monitoring costs and others we are also a defendant in legal proceedings arising from the manufacture and sale of nonleadbased paints which seek recovery based upon various legal theories including the failure to adequately warn of potential exposure to lead during surface preparation when using nonleadbased paint on surfaces previously painted with leadbased paint we believe that the litigation brought to date is without merit or subject to meritorious defenses and are vigorously defending such litigation we expect that additional lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation may be filed against us in the future asserting similar or different legal theories and seeking similar or different types of damages and relief 

notwithstanding our views on the merits litigation is inherently subject to many uncertainties and we ultimately may not prevail adverse court rulings such as the jury verdict against us and other defendants in the state of rhode island action and the wisconsin state supreme court’s determination that wisconsin’s risk contribution theory may apply in the lead pigment litigation or determinations of liability among other factors could affect the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation against us and encourage an increase in the number and nature of future claims and proceedings in addition from time to time various legislation and administrative regulations have been enacted promulgated or proposed to impose obligations on present and former manufacturers of lead pigments and leadbased paints respecting asserted health concerns associated with such products or to overturn the effect of court decisions in which we and other manufacturers have been successful 

due to the uncertainties involved management is unable to predict the outcome of the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation the number or nature of possible future claims and proceedings or the effect that any legislation andor administrative regulations may have on the litigation or against us in addition management cannot reasonably determine the scope or amount of the potential costs and liabilities related to such litigation or any such legislation and regulations we have not accrued any amounts for such litigation with respect to such litigation including the public nuisance litigation the company does not believe that it is probable that a loss has occurred and it is not possible to estimate the range of potential losses as there is no prior history of a loss of this nature and there is no substantive information upon which an estimate could be based in addition any potential liability that may result from such legislation and regulations cannot reasonably be estimated in the event any significant liability is determined to be attributable to us relating to such litigation the recording of the liability may result in a material impact on net income for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued additionally due to the uncertainties associated with the amount of any such liability andor the nature 

  

of any other remedy which may be imposed in such litigation any potential liability determined to be attributable to us arising out of such litigation may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition an estimate of the potential impact on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition cannot be made due to the aforementioned uncertainties 

we discuss the risks and uncertainties related to litigation including the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation in more detail on page 23 of our 2011 annual report under the caption “litigation and other contingent liabilities” and pages 31 through 33 of our 2011 annual report under the caption “litigation” of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 67 through 69 of our 2011 annual report 

the costs or potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us through our ownership of life shield could have an adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

we own life shield engineered systems llc life shield develops and manufactures blast and fragment mitigating systems the blast and fragment mitigating systems create a potentially higher level of product liability for us than is normally associated with coatings and related products we manufacture distribute and sell depending upon the extent of any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us relating to life shield such liability could have an adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition we discuss these risks and uncertainties in more detail on page 31 of our 2011 annual report under the caption “contingent liabilities” of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations”

basis of reportable segments 

 

we report our segment information in the same way that management internally organizes our business for assessing performance and making decisions regarding allocation of resources in accordance with the segment reporting topic of the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification asc we have three reportable operating segments paint stores group consumer group and global finishes group collectively the “reportable operating segments” factors considered in determining our reportable operating segments include the nature of the business activities the management structure directly accountable to the company’s chief operating decision maker codm for operating and administrative activities availability of discrete financial information and information presented to our board of directors operating segments that are not individually significant based on quantitative thresholds in asc 280105012 are aggregated within the global finishes group we report all other business activities and immaterial operating segments that are not reportable in the administrative segment for more information about the reportable operating segments see pages 6 through 11 of our 2010 annual report which is incorporated herein by reference 

 

the company’s codm has been identified as the chief executive officer because he has final authority over performance assessment and resource allocation decisions because of the diverse operations of the company the codm regularly receives discrete financial information about each reportable operating segment as well as a significant amount of additional financial information about certain divisions business units or subsidiaries of the company the codm uses all such financial information for performance assessment and resource allocation decisions the codm evaluates the performance of and allocates resources to the reportable operating segments based on profit or loss before income taxes and cash generated from operations the accounting policies of the reportable operating segments are the same as those described in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 46 through 50 of our 2010 annual report which is incorporated herein by reference

consumer group 

 

the consumer group develops manufactures and distributes a variety of paint coatings and related products to third party customers primarily in the united states and canada and the paint stores group approximately 53 percent of the total sales of the consumer group in 2010 were intersegment transfers of products primarily sold through the paint stores group sales and marketing of certain controlled brand and private labeled products is performed by a direct sales staff the products distributed through third party customers are intended for resale to the ultimate enduser of the product the consumer group had sales to certain customers that individually may be a significant portion of the sales of the segment however the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on the overall profitability of the segment this segment incurred most of the company’s capital expenditures related to ongoing environmental compliance measures the codm uses discrete financial information about the consumer group supplemented with information by product types and customer to assess performance of and allocate resources to the consumer group as a whole in accordance with asc 28010509 the consumer group as a whole is considered the operating segment and because it meets the criteria in asc 280105010 it is also considered a reportable operating segment

the global finishes group develops licenses manufactures distributes and sells a variety of architectural paint and coatings industrial and marine products automotive finishes and refinish products oem coatings and related products in north and south america europe and asia this segment meets the demands of its customers for a consistent worldwide product development manufacturing and distribution presence and approach to doing business this segment licenses certain technology and trade names worldwide sherwinwilliams ® and other controlled brand products are distributed through the paint stores group and this segment’s 564 companyoperated branches and by a direct sales staff and outside sales representatives to retailers dealers jobbers licensees and other third party distributors during 2010 this segment opened or acquired 35 new branches 16 in europe 9 in south america 6 in mexico 2 in canada 1 in the united states and 1 in thailand and closed 10 5 in the united states 3 in south america 1 in mexico and 1 in canada for a net increase of 25 branches at december 31 2010 the global finishes group consisted of operations in the united states subsidiaries in 45 foreign countries 3 foreign joint ventures and income from licensing agreements in 16 foreign countries the codm uses discrete financial information about each of two aggregated operating segments within the global finishes group reportable operating segment supplemented with information about geographic divisions business units and subsidiaries to assess performance of and allocate resources to each of the operating segments two operating segments are aggregated to form the global finishes group reportable operating system in accordance with the quantitative thresholds within asc 280105012 a map on pages 12 and 13 of our 2010 annual report which is incorporated herein by reference shows the number of branches and their geographic locations 

administrative segment 

 

the administrative segment includes the administrative expenses of the company’s corporate headquarters site also included in the administrative segment was interest expense interest and investment income certain expenses related to closed facilities and environmentalrelated matters and other expenses which were not directly associated with the reportable operating segments the administrative segment did not include any significant foreign operations also included in the administrative segment was a real estate management unit that is responsible for the ownership management and leasing of nonretail properties held primarily for use by the company including the company’s headquarters site and disposal of idle facilities sales of this segment represented external leasing revenue of excess headquarters space or leasing of facilities no longer used by the company in its primary businesses gains and losses from the sale of property were not a significant operating factor in determining the performance of the administrative segment

for financial information regarding our reportable operating segments including net external sales segment profit identifiable assets and other information by segment see note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 74 through 77 of our 2010 annual report which is incorporated herein by reference 

 

domestic and foreign operations 

 

financial and other information regarding domestic and foreign operations is set forth in note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements on page 76 of our 2010 annual report which is incorporated herein by reference

business developments 

 

for additional information regarding our business and business developments see pages 6 through 14 of our 2010 annual report and the “letter to shareholders” on pages 2 through 5 of our 2010 annual report which is incorporated herein by reference 

 

raw materials and products purchased for resale 

 

we believe we generally have adequate sources of raw materials and fuel supplies used in our business however consolidation of raw material suppliers and a reduction in raw material manufacturing capacity during the recent recession along with an increase in global demand for certain raw materials resulted in shortages and increased prices of certain raw materials in 2010 such consolidation and reduced raw materials manufacturing capacity coupled with a continued increase in global demand for certain raw materials and coatings as the global economy recovers may result in continued shortages and increased prices of certain raw materials for the reportable operating segments during 2011 there are sufficient suppliers of each product purchased for resale that none of the reportable operating segments anticipate any significant sourcing problems during 2011 see item 1a risk factors for more information regarding cost and sourcing of raw materials 

 

seasonality 

 

the majority of the sales for the reportable operating segments traditionally occur during the second and third quarters there is no significant seasonality in sales for the administrative segment 

 

working capital 

 

in order to meet increased demand during the second and third quarters the company usually builds its inventories during the first quarter working capital items inventories and accounts receivable are generally financed through shortterm borrowings which include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of commercial 

paper for a description of the company’s liquidity and capital resources see pages 23 through 33 of our 2010 annual report under the caption “financial condition liquidity and cash flow” of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” which is incorporated herein by reference 

 

trademarks and trade names 

 

customer recognition of our trademarks and trade names collectively contribute significantly to our sales the major trademarks and trade names used by each reportable operating segment are set forth below 

 

  

patents 

 

although patents and licenses are not of material importance to our business as a whole or any segment the global finishes group derives a portion of its income from the licensing of technology trademarks and trade names to foreign companies 

 

backlog and productive capacity 

 

backlog orders are not significant in the business of any reportable operating segment since there is normally a short period of time between the placing of an order and shipment we believe that sufficient productive capacity currently exists to fulfill our needs for paint coatings and related products through 2011 

 

research and development 

 

for information regarding our costs of research and development included in technical expenditures see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements on page 49 of our 2010 annual report which is incorporated herein by reference 

 

competition 

 

we experience competition from many local regional national and international competitors of various sizes in the manufacture distribution and sale of our paint coatings and related products we are a leading manufacturer and retailer of paint coatings and related products to professional industrial commercial and retail customers however our competitive position varies for our different products and markets 

 

in the paint stores group competitors include other paint and wallpaper stores mass merchandisers home centers independent hardware stores hardware chains and manufactureroperated direct outlets product quality product innovation breadth of product line technical expertise service and price determine the competitive advantage for this segment 

 

in the consumer group domestic and foreign competitors include manufacturers and distributors of branded and private labeled paint and coatings products technology product quality product innovation breadth of product line technical expertise distribution service and price are the key competitive factors for this segment 

the global finishes group has numerous competitors in its domestic and foreign markets with broad product offerings and several others with niche products key competitive factors for this segment include technology product quality product innovation breadth of product line technical expertise distribution service and price 

 

the administrative segment has many competitors consisting of other real estate owners developers and managers in areas in which this segment owns property the main competitive factors are the availability of property and price

 item 1a risk factors 

 

described below and elsewhere in this report and other documents that we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission are risks uncertainties and other factors that can adversely affect our business results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

 

adverse changes in general business and economic conditions in the united states and worldwide may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

 

adverse changes in general business and economic conditions in the united states and worldwide may reduce the demand for some of our products and adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition higher inflation rates interest rates tax rates and unemployment rates higher labor and healthcare costs recessions changing governmental policies laws and regulations and other economic factors that adversely affect the demand for our paint coatings and related products could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

 

the duration and severity of the current global economic and financial conditions may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

 

a protracted continuation or worsening of the current global economic and financial conditions may adversely impact our net sales the collection of accounts receivable funding for working capital needs expected cash flow generation from current and acquired businesses and our investments which may adversely impact our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

 

we finance a portion of our sales through trade credit the current global economic and financial conditions have caused some customers to be less profitable and have increased our exposure to credit risk in addition due to the tightening of credit markets some customers who require financing for their businesses have not been able to obtain necessary financing continuation of these conditions could limit our ability to collect our accounts receivable which could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

 

we generally fund a portion of our seasonal working capital needs and obtain funding for other general corporate purposes through shortterm borrowings backed by our revolving credit facility and other financing facilities if any of the banks in these credit and financing facilities are unable to perform on their commitments 

which could adversely affect our ability to fund seasonal working capital needs and obtain funding for other general corporate purposes our cash flow liquidity or financial condition could be adversely impacted 

 

although we currently have available credit facilities to fund our current operating needs we cannot be certain that we will be able to replace our existing credit facilities or refinance our existing debt when necessary our cost of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by our debt and credit ratings assigned by the major credit rating agencies downgrades in these ratings will increase our cost of borrowing and could have an adverse effect on our access to the capital markets including our access to the commercial paper market an inability to access the capital markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

 

we have goodwill and intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet we periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such value may not be recoverable impairment assessment involves judgment as to assumptions regarding future sales and cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions future events and changing market conditions may impact our assumptions and may result in changes in our estimates of future sales and cash flows that may result in us incurring substantial impairment charges which would adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

 

we hold investments in equity and debt securities in some of our defined benefit pension plans a decrease in the value of plan assets resulting from a general financial downturn may cause a negative pension plan investment performance which may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

 

protracted duration of economic downturns in cyclical segments of the economy may continue to depress the demand for some of our products and adversely affect our sales earnings cash flow or financial condition 

 

portions of our business involve the sale of paint coatings and related products to segments of the economy that are cyclical in nature particularly segments relating to construction housing and manufacturing our sales to these segments are affected by the levels of discretionary consumer and business spending in these segments during economic downturns in these segments the levels of consumer and business discretionary spending may decrease and the recovery of these segments may lag behind the recovery of the overall economy this decrease in spending will likely reduce the demand for some of our products and may adversely affect our sales earnings cash flow or financial condition 

 

during the recent recession the us homebuilding industry experienced a significant and sustained decrease in demand for new homes and an oversupply of new and existing homes available for sale during this same time period the us real estate industry also experienced a significant decrease in existing home turnover the commercial and industrial building and maintenance sectors also began to experience a significant decline in 2008 the downturn in each of these segments and a lack of a meaningful recovery has continued to contribute to an unprecedented decline in the demand for some of our products and has continued to adversely affect our sales and earnings new home starts existing home sales and new commercial construction are significantly below their prerecession highs although many of our end markets have started to show signs of stabilization and modest improvement challenging market conditions are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and may worsen a continued downturn or worsening in these segments will continue to reduce the demand for some of our products and may adversely impact sales earnings and cash flow 

 

increases in the cost of raw materials and energy may adversely affect our earnings or cash flow 

 

we purchase raw materials and energy for use in the manufacturing distribution and sale of our products factors such as adverse weather conditions including hurricanes and other disasters can disrupt raw material and fuel supplies and increase our costs in addition many raw material suppliers decreased manufacturing capacity during the recent recession continued economic recovery has caused and may continue to cause demand pressure on raw material supplies the decrease in manufacturing capacity along with strong global demand for certain raw materials has caused and may continue to cause tight supplies and significant price increases especially in titanium dioxide and petrochemicals which are key ingredients used in the manufacture of paint and coatings although raw 

materials and energy supplies including oil and natural gas are generally available from various sources in sufficient quantities unexpected shortages and increases in the cost of raw materials and energy or any deterioration in our relationships with or the financial viability of our suppliers may have an adverse effect on our earnings or cash flow in the event we are unable to offset higher costs in a timely manner by sufficiently decreasing our operating costs or raising the prices of our products many of our paint and coatings products utilize oil based derivatives minerals including titanium dioxide and metals 

 

although we have an extensive customer base the loss of any of our largest customers could adversely affect our sales earnings or cash flow 

 

we have a large and varied customer base due to our extensive distribution network during 2010 no individual customer accounted for sales totaling more than ten percent of our sales however we have some customers that individually purchase a large amount of products from us although our broad distribution channels would help to minimize the impact of the loss of any one customer the loss of any of these large customers could have an adverse effect on our sales earnings or cash flow 

 

adverse weather conditions may temporarily reduce the demand for some of our products and could have a negative effect on our sales earnings or cash flow 

 

from time to time adverse weather conditions in certain parts of the united states have had an adverse effect on our sales of paint coatings and related products for example unusually cold and rainy weather especially during the exterior painting season could have an adverse effect on sales of our exterior paint products an adverse effect on sales may cause a reduction in our earnings or cash flow 

 

increased competition may reduce our sales earnings or cash flow performance 

 

we face substantial competition from many international national regional and local competitors of various sizes in the manufacture distribution and sale of our paint coatings and related products some of our competitors are larger than us and have greater financial resources to compete other competitors are smaller and may be able to offer more specialized products technology product quality product innovation breadth of product line technical expertise distribution service and price are the key competitive factors for our business competition in any of these areas may reduce our sales and adversely affect our earnings or cash flow by resulting in decreased sales volumes reduced prices and increased costs of manufacturing distributing and selling our products 

 

our results of operations cash flow or financial condition may be negatively impacted if we do not successfully integrate past and future acquisitions into our existing operations and if the performance of the businesses we acquire do not meet our expectations 

 

we have historically made strategic acquisitions of businesses in the paint and coatings industry and will likely acquire additional businesses in the future as part of our longterm growth strategy in 2010 we acquired two industrial wood coatings businesses sayerlack and becker acroma with significant operations in europe and pinturas condor the largest paint and coatings company in ecuador these acquisitions involve challenges and risks in the event that we do not successfully integrate these acquisitions into our existing operations so as to realize the expected return on our investment our results of operations cash flow or financial condition could be adversely affected 

 

risks and uncertainties associated with our expansion into and our operations in asia europe mexico south america and other foreign markets could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

 

net external sales of our consolidated foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately 147 billion in 2010 or 189 of our total consolidated net sales sales outside of the united states make up an important part of our current business and future strategic plans our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition could be adversely affected by a variety of international factors including general economic conditions inflation rates recessions foreign currency exchange rates foreign currency exchange controls interest rates foreign investment and repatriation restrictions legal and regulatory constraints civil unrest difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and other external 

economic and political factors our inability to successfully manage the risks and uncertainties relating to these factors could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

 

in many foreign countries it is acceptable to engage in certain business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in because of regulations that are applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act although we have internal control policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these regulations there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prevent a violation of these regulations any violation could cause an adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

 

because of our international operations we are exposed to risk associated with interest rates and value changes in foreign currencies which may adversely affect our business historically our reported net sales earnings cash flow and financial condition have been subjected to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates our primary exchange rate exposure is with the euro the british pound the argentine peso the brazilian real the chilean peso the canadian dollar and the mexican peso against the us dollar while we actively manage the exposure of our foreign currency risk as part of our overall financial risk management policy we believe we may experience losses from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and such losses could adversely affect our sales earnings cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

 

we are subject to a wide variety of complex domestic and foreign laws and regulations for which compliance could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

 

we are subject to a wide variety of complex domestic and foreign laws and regulations and legal compliance risks including securities laws tax laws employment and pensionrelated laws competition laws us and foreign export and trading laws and laws governing improper business practices we are affected by new laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations including interpretations by courts and regulators from time to time our company our operations and the industries in which we operate are being reviewed or investigated by regulators which could lead to enforcement actions or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages 

 

although we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to mitigate these risks the global and diverse nature of our operations means that compliance risks will continue to exist investigations examinations and other proceedings the nature and outcome of which cannot be predicted will likely arise from time to time these investigations examinations and other proceedings could subject us to significant liability and require us to take significant accruals or pay significant settlements fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

 

we are subject to tax laws and regulations in the united states and multiple foreign jurisdictions we are affected by changes in tax laws and regulations as well as changes in related interpretations and other tax guidance in the ordinary course of our business we are subject to examinations and investigations by various tax authorities in addition to existing examinations and investigations there could be additional examinations and investigations in the future and existing examinations and investigations could be expanded 

 

for nonincome tax risks we estimate material loss contingencies and accrue for such loss contingencies as required by us generally accepted accounting principles based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency in the event the loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently accrued the recording of the additional liability may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such additional liability is accrued in those cases where no accrual is recorded because it is not probable that a liability has been incurred and cannot be reasonably estimated any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued or paid for income tax risks we recognize tax benefits based on our assessment that a tax benefit has a greater than 50 likelihood of being sustained upon ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority that has full 

knowledge of all relevant facts for those income tax positions where we assess that there is not a greater than 50 likelihood that such tax benefits will be sustained we do not recognize a tax benefit in our financial statements subsequent events may cause us to change our assessment of the likelihood of sustaining a previouslyrecognized benefit which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial position for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued or paid 

 

we discuss risks and uncertainties with regard to taxes in more detail in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 71 through 73 of our 2010 annual report 

 

we are required to comply with numerous complex and increasingly stringent domestic and foreign health safety and environmental laws and regulations the cost of which is likely to increase and may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

 

our operations are subject to various domestic and foreign health safety and environmental laws and regulations these laws and regulations not only govern our current operations and products but also impose potential liability on us for our past operations we expect health safety and environmental laws and regulations to impose increasingly stringent requirements upon our industry and us in the future our costs to comply with these laws and regulations may increase as these requirements become more stringent in the future and these increased costs may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

 

we are involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of our currently and formerly owned sites as well as a number of thirdparty sites for which our ultimate liability may exceed the current amount we have accrued 

 

we are involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of our currently and formerly owned sites and a number of thirdparty sites we accrue for estimated costs of investigation and remediation activities at these sites for which commitments or cleanup plans have been developed and when such costs can be reasonably estimated based on industry standards and professional judgment these estimated costs are based on currently available facts regarding each site we continuously assess our potential liability for investigation and remediation activities and adjust our environmentalrelated accruals as information becomes available upon which more accurate costs can be reasonably estimated due to the uncertainties surrounding environmental investigation and remediation activities our liability may result in costs that are significantly higher than currently accrued and may have an adverse affect on our earnings we discuss these risks and uncertainties in more detail on page 22 of our 2010 annual report under the caption “environmental matters” pages 26 and 27 of our 2010 annual report under the caption “environmentalrelated liabilities” and in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 64 and 65 of our 2010 annual report 

 

the nature cost quantity and outcome of pending and future litigation such as litigation arising from the historical manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paint could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity and financial condition 

 

in the course of our business we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits including litigation relating to product liability and warranty personal injury environmental intellectual property commercial contractual and antitrust claims that are inherently subject to many uncertainties regarding the possibility of a loss to us these uncertainties will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur confirming the incurrence of a liability or the reduction of a liability in accordance with the contingencies topic of the asc we accrue for these contingencies by a charge to income when it is both probable that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact of a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated in the event that a loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently accrued the recording of the additional liability may result in a material impact on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such additional liability is accrued in those cases where no accrual is recorded because it is not probable that a liability has been incurred and cannot be reasonably estimated any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us may result in a material impact on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued in those cases where no accrual is recorded or exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued the 

contingencies topic of the asc requires disclosure of the contingency when there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or additional loss may have been incurred even if the possibility may be remote 

 

our past operations included the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paints along with other companies we are a defendant in a number of legal proceedings including individual personal injury actions purported class actions and actions brought by various counties cities school districts and other governmentrelated entities arising from the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paints the plaintiffs are seeking recovery based upon various legal theories including negligence strict liability breach of warranty negligent misrepresentations and omissions fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions concert of action civil conspiracy violations of unfair trade practice and consumer protection laws enterprise liability market share liability public nuisance unjust enrichment and other theories the plaintiffs seek various damages and relief including personal injury and property damage costs relating to the detection and abatement of leadbased paint from buildings costs associated with a public education campaign medical monitoring costs and others we are also a defendant in legal proceedings arising from the manufacture and sale of nonleadbased paints which seek recovery based upon various legal theories including the failure to adequately warn of potential exposure to lead during surface preparation when using nonleadbased paint on surfaces previously painted with leadbased paint we believe that the litigation brought to date is without merit or subject to meritorious defenses and are vigorously defending such litigation we expect that additional lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation may be filed against us in the future asserting similar or different legal theories and seeking similar or different types of damages and relief 

 

notwithstanding our views on the merits litigation is inherently subject to many uncertainties and we ultimately may not prevail adverse court rulings such as the jury verdict against us and other defendants in the state of rhode island action and the wisconsin state supreme court’s determination that wisconsin’s risk contribution theory may apply in the lead pigment litigation or determinations of liability among other factors could affect the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation against us and encourage an increase in the number and nature of future claims and proceedings in addition from time to time various legislation and administrative regulations have been enacted promulgated or proposed to impose obligations on present and former manufacturers of lead pigments and leadbased paints respecting asserted health concerns associated with such products or to overturn the effect of court decisions in which we and other manufacturers have been successful 

 

due to the uncertainties involved management is unable to predict the outcome of the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation the number or nature of possible future claims and proceedings or the effect that any legislation andor administrative regulations may have on the litigation or against us in addition management cannot reasonably determine the scope or amount of the potential costs and liabilities related to such litigation or any such legislation and regulations we have not accrued any amounts for such litigation any potential liability that may result from such litigation or such legislation and regulations cannot reasonably be estimated in the event any significant liability is determined to be attributable to us relating to such litigation the recording of the liability may result in a material impact on net income for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued additionally due to the uncertainties associated with the amount of any such liability andor the nature of any other remedy which may be imposed in such litigation any potential liability determined to be attributable to us arising out of such litigation may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition an estimate of the potential impact on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition cannot be made due to the aforementioned uncertainties 

 

we discuss the risks and uncertainties related to litigation including the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation in more detail on page 22 of our 2010 annual report under the caption “litigation and other contingent liabilities” and pages 30 through 32 of our 2010 annual report under the caption “litigation” of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 65 through 67 of our 2010 annual report 

 

the costs or potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us through our ownership of life shield could have an adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

 

we own life shield engineered systems llc life shield develops and manufactures blast and fragment mitigating systems the blast and fragment mitigating systems create a potentially higher level of product liability 

for us than is normally associated with coatings and related products we manufacture distribute and sell depending upon the extent of any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us relating to life shield such liability could have an adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition we discuss these risks and uncertainties in more detail on pages 29 and 30 of our 2010 annual report under the caption “contingent liabilities” of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations”

patents 

 

although patents and licenses are not of material importance to our business as a whole or any segment the global finishes group derives a portion of its income from the licensing of technology trademarks and trade names to foreign companies 

 

backlog and productive capacity 

 

backlog orders are not significant in the business of any reportable operating segment since there is normally a short period of time between the placing of an order and shipment we believe that sufficient productive capacity currently exists to fulfill our needs for paint coatings and related products through 2010

adverse changes in general business and economic conditions in the united states and worldwide may reduce the demand for some of our products and adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition higher inflation rates interest rates tax rates and unemployment rates higher labor and healthcare costs recessions changing governmental policies laws and regulations and other economic factors that adversely affect the demand for our paint coatings and related products could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

 

the duration and severity of the current global economic and financial downturn may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

 

a protracted continuation or worsening of the current global economic and financial conditions may adversely impact our net sales the collection of accounts receivable funding for working capital needs expected cash flow generation from current and acquired businesses and our investments which may adversely impact our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

 

we finance a portion of our sales through trade credit the current global economic and financial conditions have caused some customers to be less profitable and have increased our exposure to credit risk in addition due to the tightening of credit markets some customers who require financing for their businesses have not been able to obtain necessary financing continuation of these conditions could limit our ability to collect our accounts receivable which could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

 

we generally fund a portion of our seasonal working capital needs and obtain funding for other general corporate purposes through shortterm borrowings backed by our revolving credit facility and other financing facilities if any of the banks in these credit and financing facilities are unable to perform on their commitments which could adversely affect our ability to fund seasonal working capital needs and obtain funding for other general corporate purposes our cash flow liquidity or financial condition could be adversely impacted 

 

although we currently have available credit facilities to fund our current operating needs we cannot be certain that we will be able to replace our existing credit facilities or refinance our existing debt when necessary our cost of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by our debt and credit ratings assigned by the major credit rating agencies downgrades in these ratings will increase our cost of borrowing and could have an adverse effect on our access to the capital markets including our access to the commercial paper market an inability to access the capital markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

 

we have goodwill and intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet we periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such value may not be recoverable impairment assessment involves judgment as to assumptions regarding future sales and cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions future events and changing market conditions may impact our assumptions and may result in changes in our estimates of future sales and cash flows that may result in us incurring substantial impairment charges which would adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

we hold investments in equity and debt securities in some of our defined benefit pension plans a decrease in the value of plan assets resulting from a general financial downturn may cause a negative pension plan investment performance which may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

 

economic downturns in cyclical segments of the economy may reduce the demand for some of our products and adversely affect our sales earnings cash flow or financial condition 

 

portions of our business involve the sale of paint coatings and related products to segments of the economy that are cyclical in nature particularly segments relating to construction housing and manufacturing our sales to these segments are affected by the levels of discretionary consumer and business spending in these segments during economic downturns in these segments the levels of consumer and business discretionary spending may decrease this decrease in spending will likely reduce the demand for some of our products and may adversely affect our sales earnings cash flow or financial condition 

 

during the past three years the us homebuilding industry experienced a significant and sustained decrease in demand for new homes and an oversupply of new and existing homes available for sale during this same time period the us real estate industry also experienced a significant decrease in existing home turnover the commercial and industrial building and maintenance sectors also began to experience a significant decline in 2008 the downturn in each of these segments has contributed to an unprecedented decline in the demand for some of our products and adversely affected our sales and earnings we cannot predict the duration or severity of the downturn in these segments continued downturn in these segments will continue to reduce the demand for some of our products and may adversely impact sales earnings and cash flow 

 

increases in the cost of raw materials and energy may adversely affect our earnings or cash flow 

 

we purchase raw materials and energy for use in the manufacturing distribution and sale of our products factors such as adverse weather conditions including hurricanes and other disasters can disrupt raw material and fuel supplies and increase our costs although raw materials and energy supplies are generally available from various sources in sufficient quantities unexpected shortages and increases in the cost of raw materials and energy or any deterioration in our relationships with or the financial viability of our suppliers may have an adverse effect on our earnings or cash flow in the event we are unable to offset higher costs in a timely manner by sufficiently decreasing our operating costs or raising the prices of our products many of our paint and coatings products utilize petroleum based derivatives minerals including titanium dioxide and metals 

 

although we have an extensive customer base the loss of any of our largest customers could adversely affect our sales earnings or cash flow 

 

we have a large and varied customer base due to our extensive distribution network during 2009 no individual customer accounted for sales totaling more than ten percent of our sales however we have some customers that individually purchase a large amount of products from us although our broad distribution channels would help to minimize the impact of the loss of any one customer the loss of any of these large customers could have an adverse effect on our sales earnings or cash flow 

 

adverse weather conditions may temporarily reduce the demand for some of our products and could have a negative effect on our sales earnings or cash flow 

 

from time to time adverse weather conditions in certain parts of the united states have had an adverse effect on our sales of paint coatings and related products for example unusually cold and rainy weather especially during the exterior painting season could have an adverse effect on sales of our exterior paint products an adverse effect on sales may cause a reduction in our earnings or cash flow 

 

increased competition may reduce our sales earnings or cash flow performance 

 

we face substantial competition from many international national regional and local competitors of various sizes in the manufacture distribution and sale of our paint coatings and related products some of our competitors are larger than us and have greater financial resources to compete other competitors are smaller and may be able to 

offer more specialized products technology product quality product innovation breadth of product line technical expertise distribution service and price are the key competitive factors for our business competition in any of these areas may reduce our sales and adversely affect our earnings or cash flow by resulting in decreased sales volumes reduced prices and increased costs of manufacturing distributing and selling our products 

 

our results of operations cash flow or financial condition may be negatively impacted if we do not successfully integrate past and future acquisitions into our existing operations and if the performance of the businesses we acquire do not meet our expectations 

 

we have historically made strategic acquisitions of businesses in the paint and coatings industry and will likely acquire additional businesses in the future as part of our long term growth strategy these acquisitions involve challenges and risks in the event that we do not successfully integrate these acquisitions into our existing operations so as to realize the expected return on our investment our results of operations cash flow or financial condition could be adversely affected 

 

risks and uncertainties associated with our expansion into and our operations in asia mexico south america and other foreign markets could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

 

net external sales of our consolidated foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately 103 billion in 2009 or 145 of our total consolidated net sales sales outside of the united states make up an important part of our current business and future strategic plans our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition could be adversely affected by a variety of international factors including general economic conditions inflation rates recessions foreign currency exchange rates foreign currency exchange controls interest rates foreign investment and repatriation restrictions legal and regulatory constraints civil unrest difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and other external economic and political factors our inability to successfully manage the risks and uncertainties relating to these factors could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

 

in many foreign countries it is acceptable to engage in certain business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in because of regulations that are applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act although we have internal control policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these regulations there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prevent a violation of these regulations any violation could cause an adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

 

because of our international operations we are exposed to risk associated with interest rates and value changes in foreign currencies which may adversely affect our business historically our reported net sales earnings cash flow and financial condition have been subjected to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates our primary exchange rate exposure is with the euro the british pound the argentine peso the brazilian real the chilean peso the canadian dollar and the mexican peso against the us dollar while we actively manage the exposure of our foreign currency risk as part of our overall financial risk management policy we believe we may experience losses from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and such losses could adversely affect our sales earnings cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

 

we are subject to a wide variety of complex domestic and foreign laws and regulations for which compliance could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

 

we are subject to a wide variety of complex domestic and foreign laws and regulations and legal compliance risks including securities laws tax laws employment and pensionrelated laws competition laws us and foreign export and trading laws and laws governing improper business practices we are affected by new laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations including interpretations by courts and regulators from time to time our company our operations and the industries in which we operate are being reviewed or investigated by regulators which could lead to enforcement actions or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages 

although we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to mitigate these risks the global and diverse nature of our operations means that compliance risks will continue to exist investigations examinations and other proceedings the nature and outcome of which cannot be predicted will likely arise from time to time these investigations examinations and other proceedings could subject us to significant liability and require us to take significant accruals or pay significant settlements fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

 

we are subject to tax laws and regulations in the united states and multiple foreign jurisdictions we are affected by changes in tax laws and regulations as well as changes in related interpretations and other tax guidance in the ordinary course of our business we are subject to examinations and investigations by various tax authorities in addition to existing examinations and investigations there could be additional examinations and investigations in the future and existing examinations and investigations could be expanded 

 

for nonincome tax risks we estimate material loss contingencies and accrue for such loss contingencies as required by us generally accepted accounting principles based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency in the event the loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently accrued the recording of the additional liability may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such additional liability is accrued in those cases where no accrual is recorded because it is not probable that a liability has been incurred and cannot be reasonably estimated any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued or paid for income tax risks we recognize tax benefits based on our assessment that a tax benefit has a greater than 50 likelihood of being sustained upon ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant facts for those income tax positions where we assess that there is not a greater than 50 likelihood that such tax benefits will be sustained we do not recognize a tax benefit in our financial statements subsequent events may cause us to change our assessment of the likelihood of sustaining a previouslyrecognized benefit which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial position for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued or paid 

 

we are required to comply with numerous complex and increasingly stringent domestic and foreign health safety and environmental laws and regulations the cost of which is likely to increase and may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

 

our operations are subject to various domestic and foreign health safety and environmental laws and regulations these laws and regulations not only govern our current operations and products but also impose potential liability on us for our past operations we expect health safety and environmental laws and regulations to impose increasingly stringent requirements upon our industry and us in the future our costs to comply with these laws and regulations may increase as these requirements become more stringent in the future and these increased costs may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

 

we are involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of our currently and formerly owned sites as well as a number of thirdparty sites for which our ultimate liability may exceed the current amount we have accrued 

 

we are involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of our currently and formerly owned sites and a number of thirdparty sites we accrue for estimated costs of investigation and remediation activities at these sites for which commitments or cleanup plans have been developed and when such costs can be reasonably estimated based on industry standards and professional judgment these estimated costs are based on currently available facts regarding each site we continuously assess our potential liability for investigation and remediation activities and adjust our environmentalrelated accruals as information becomes available upon which more accurate costs can be reasonably estimated due to the uncertainties surrounding environmental investigation and remediation activities our liability may result in costs that are significantly higher than currently accrued and may have an adverse affect on our earnings 

the nature cost quantity and outcome of pending and future litigation such as litigation arising from the historical manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paint could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity and financial condition 

 

in the course of our business we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits including litigation relating to product liability and warranty personal injury environmental intellectual property commercial contractual and antitrust claims that are inherently subject to many uncertainties regarding the possibility of a loss to us these uncertainties will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur confirming the incurrence of a liability or the reduction of a liability in accordance with the contingencies topic of the asc we accrue for these contingencies by a charge to income when it is both probable that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact of a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated in the event that a loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently accrued the recording of the additional liability may result in a material impact on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such additional liability is accrued in those cases where no accrual is recorded because it is not probable that a liability has been incurred and cannot be reasonably estimated any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us may result in a material impact on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued in those cases where no accrual is recorded or exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued the contingencies topic of the asc requires disclosure of the contingency when there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or additional loss may have been incurred even if the possibility may be remote 

 

our past operations included the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paints along with other companies we are a defendant in a number of legal proceedings including individual personal injury actions purported class actions and actions brought by various counties cities school districts and other governmentrelated entities arising from the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paints the plaintiffs are seeking recovery based upon various legal theories including negligence strict liability breach of warranty negligent misrepresentations and omissions fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions concert of action civil conspiracy violations of unfair trade practice and consumer protection laws enterprise liability market share liability public nuisance unjust enrichment and other theories the plaintiffs seek various damages and relief including personal injury and property damage costs relating to the detection and abatement of leadbased paint from buildings costs associated with a public education campaign medical monitoring costs and others we are also a defendant in legal proceedings arising from the manufacture and sale of nonleadbased paints which seek recovery based upon various legal theories including the failure to adequately warn of potential exposure to lead during surface preparation when using nonleadbased paint on surfaces previously painted with leadbased paint we believe that the litigation brought to date is without merit or subject to meritorious defenses and are vigorously defending such litigation we expect that additional lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation may be filed against us in the future asserting similar or different legal theories and seeking similar or different types of damages and relief 

 

notwithstanding our views on the merits litigation is inherently subject to many uncertainties and we ultimately may not prevail adverse court rulings such as the jury verdict against us and other defendants in the state of rhode island action and the wisconsin state supreme court’s determination that wisconsin’s risk contribution theory may apply in the lead pigment litigation or determinations of liability among other factors could affect the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation against us and encourage an increase in the number and nature of future claims and proceedings in addition from time to time various legislation and administrative regulations have been enacted promulgated or proposed to impose obligations on present and former manufacturers of lead pigments and leadbased paints respecting asserted health concerns associated with such products or to overturn the effect of court decisions in which we and other manufacturers have been successful 

 

due to the uncertainties involved management is unable to predict the outcome of the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation the number or nature of possible future claims and proceedings or the effect that any legislation andor administrative regulations may have on the litigation or against us in addition management cannot reasonably determine the scope or amount of the potential costs and liabilities related to such litigation or any such legislation and regulations we have not accrued any amounts for such litigation any potential liability that may result from such litigation or such legislation and regulations cannot reasonably be estimated in the event any significant liability is determined to be attributable to us relating to such litigation the recording of the liability 

may result in a material impact on net income for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued additionally due to the uncertainties associated with the amount of any such liability andor the nature of any other remedy which may be imposed in such litigation any potential liability determined to be attributable to us arising out of such litigation may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition an estimate of the potential impact on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition cannot be made due to the aforementioned uncertainties 

 

we discuss the risks and uncertainties related to litigation including the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation in more detail on page 18 of our 2009 annual report under the caption “litigation and other contingent liabilities” and pages 26 through 29 of our 2009 annual report under the caption “litigation” of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 65 through 68 of our 2009 annual report 

 

the costs or potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us through our ownership of life shield could have an adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

 

we own life shield engineered systems llc life shield develops and manufactures blast and fragment mitigating systems and ballistic resistant systems the blast and fragment mitigating systems and ballistic resistant systems create a potentially higher level of product liability for us than is normally associated with coatings and related products we manufacture distribute and sell depending upon the extent of any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us relating to life shield such liability could have an adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition we discuss these risks and uncertainties in more detail on pages 25 and 26 of our 2009 annual report under the caption “contingent liabilities” of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations”

we report our segment information in the same way that management internally organizes our business for assessing performance and making decisions regarding allocation of resources in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards fas no 131 “disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information” we have three reportable operating segments paint stores group consumer group and global finishes group collectively the “reportable operating segments” factors considered in determining our reportable operating segments include the nature of the business activities existence of managers responsible for the operating and administrative activities and information presented to our board of directors we report all other business activities and immaterial operating segments that are not reportable in the administrative segment 

 

the company’s chief operating decision maker codm has been identified as the chief executive officer because he has final authority over performance assessment and resource allocation decisions because of the diverse operations of the company the codm regularly receives discrete financial information about each reportable operating segment as well as a significant amount of additional financial information about certain divisions business units or subsidiaries of the company the codm uses all such financial information for performance assessment and resource allocation decisions the codm evaluates the performance of and allocates resources to the reportable operating segments based on profit or loss before income taxes and cash generated from operations the accounting policies of the reportable operating segments are the same as those described in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 44 through 49 of our 2008 annual report which is incorporated herein by reference

the majority of the sales for the reportable operating segments traditionally occur during the second and third quarters there is no significant seasonality in sales for the administrative segment 

 

working capital 

 

in order to meet increased demand during the second and third quarters the company usually builds its inventories during the first quarter working capital items inventories and accounts receivable are generally financed through shortterm borrowings which include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of commercial paper for a description of the company’s liquidity and capital resources see pages 19 through 30 of our 2008 annual report under the caption “financial condition liquidity and cash flow” of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” which is incorporated herein by reference

patents 

 

although patents and licenses are not of material importance to our business as a whole or any segment the global finishes group derives a portion of its income from the licensing of technology trademarks and trade names to foreign companies 

backlog and productive capacity 

 

backlog orders are not significant in the business of any reportable operating segment since there is normally a short period of time between the placing of an order and shipment we believe that sufficient productive capacity currently exists to fulfill our needs for paint coatings and related products through 2009

readers are cautioned that it is not possible to predict or identify all of the risks uncertainties and other factors that may affect future results and that the above list should not be considered to be a complete list any forwardlooking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statement whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 

 




 item 1a risk factors 

 

described below and elsewhere in this report and other documents that we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission are risks uncertainties and other factors that can adversely affect our business results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

adverse changes in general business conditions in the united states and worldwide may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

 

adverse changes in general business conditions in the united states and worldwide may reduce the demand for some of our products and adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition higher inflation rates interest rates tax rates and unemployment rates higher labor and healthcare costs recessions changing governmental policies laws and regulations and other economic factors that adversely affect the demand for our paint coatings and related products could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

 

negative global economic and financial conditions may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

 

continuation of the current global economic and financial conditions may adversely impact our net sales the collection of accounts receivable funding for working capital needs expected cash flow generation from current and acquired businesses and our investments which may adversely impact our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

 

we finance a portion of our sales through trade credit the current global economic and financial conditions have caused some customers to be less profitable and have increased our exposure to credit risk continuation of these conditions could limit our ability to collect our accounts receivable which could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

 

we generally fund a portion of our seasonal working capital needs and obtain funding for other general corporate purposes through shortterm borrowings backed by our revolving credit facility and other financing facilities if any of the banks in these credit and financing facilities are unable to perform on their commitments which could adversely affect our ability to fund seasonal working capital needs and obtain funding for other general corporate purposes our cash flow liquidity or financial condition could be adversely impacted 

 

we have goodwill and intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet we periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such value may not be recoverable impairment assessment involves judgment as to assumptions regarding future sales and cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions future events and changing market conditions may impact our assumptions and may result in changes in our estimates of future sales and cash flows which may result in us incurring substantial impairment charges which would adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

 

we hold investments in equity and debt securities in some of our defined benefit pension plans a decrease in the value of plan assets resulting from a general financial downturn may cause a negative pension plan investment performance which may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

 

economic downturns in cyclical segments of the economy may reduce the demand for some of our products and adversely affect our sales earnings cash flow or financial condition 

 

portions of our business involve the sale of paint coatings and related products to segments of the economy that are cyclical in nature particularly segments relating to construction housing and manufacturing our sales to these segments are affected by the levels of discretionary consumer and business spending in these segments during economic downturns in these segments the levels of consumer and business discretionary spending may decrease this decrease in spending will likely reduce the demand for some of our products and may adversely affect our sales earnings cash flow or financial condition 

 

during 2008 and 2007 the us homebuilding industry experienced a significant decrease in demand for new homes and an oversupply of new and existing homes available for sale during this same time period the us real estate industry also experienced a significant decrease in existing home turnover the commercial and industrial building and maintenance sectors also began to experience a significant decline in 2008 the downturns in each of these segments reduced the demand for some of our products and adversely affected our sales and earnings 

continued downturns in these segments will likely continue to reduce the demand for some of our products and may adversely impact sales earnings and cash flow 

 

increases in the cost of raw materials and energy may adversely affect our earnings or cash flow 

 

we purchase raw materials and energy for use in the manufacturing distribution and sale of our products factors such as adverse weather conditions including hurricanes and other disasters can disrupt raw material and fuel supplies and increase our costs although raw materials and energy supplies are generally available from various sources in sufficient quantities unexpected shortages and increases in the cost of raw materials and energy may have an adverse effect on our earnings or cash flow in the event we are unable to offset these costs in a timely manner by sufficiently decreasing our operating costs or raising the prices of our products many of our paint and coatings products utilize petroleum based derivatives minerals including titanium dioxide and metals 

 

although we have an extensive customer base the loss of any of our largest customers could adversely affect our sales earnings or cash flow 

 

we have a large and varied customer base due to our extensive distribution network during 2008 no individual customer accounted for sales totaling more than ten percent of our sales however we have some customers that individually purchase a large amount of products from us although our broad distribution channels would help to minimize the impact of the loss of any one customer the loss of any of these large customers could have an adverse effect on our sales earnings or cash flow 

 

adverse weather conditions may temporarily reduce the demand for some of our products and could have a negative effect on our sales earnings or cash flow 

 

from time to time adverse weather conditions in certain parts of the united states have had an adverse effect on our sales of paint coatings and related products for example unusually cold and rainy weather especially during the exterior painting season could have an adverse effect on sales of our exterior paint products an adverse effect on sales may cause a reduction in our earnings or cash flow 

 

increased competition may reduce our sales earnings or cash flow performance 

 

we face substantial competition from many international national regional and local competitors of various sizes in the manufacture distribution and sale of our paint coatings and related products some of our competitors are larger than us and have greater financial resources to compete other competitors are smaller and may be able to offer more specialized products technology product quality product innovation breadth of product line technical expertise distribution service and price are the key competitive factors for our business competition in any of these areas may reduce our sales and adversely affect our earnings or cash flow by resulting in decreased sales volumes reduced prices and increased costs of manufacturing distributing and selling our products 

 

our results of operations cash flow or financial condition may be negatively impacted if we do not successfully integrate past and future acquisitions into our existing operations and if the performance of the businesses we acquire do not meet our expectations 

 

we have historically made strategic acquisitions of businesses in the paint and coatings industry and will likely acquire additional businesses in the future as part of our long term growth strategy these acquisitions involve challenges and risks in the event that we do not successfully integrate these acquisitions into our existing operations so as to realize the expected return on our investment our results of operations cash flow or financial condition could be adversely affected 

 

risks and uncertainties associated with our expansion into and our operations in asia mexico south america and other foreign markets could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

 

net external sales of our consolidated foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately 112 billion in 2008 or 140 of our total consolidated net sales sales outside of the united states make up an important part of our current 

business and future strategic plans our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition could be adversely affected by a variety of international factors including general economic conditions inflation rates recessions foreign currency exchange rates foreign currency exchange controls interest rates foreign investment and repatriation restrictions legal and regulatory constraints civil unrest difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and other external economic and political factors our inability to successfully manage the risks and uncertainties relating to these factors could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

 

in many foreign countries it is acceptable to engage in certain business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in because of regulations that are applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act although we have internal control policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these regulations there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prevent a violation of these regulations any violation could cause an adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

 

because of our international operations we are exposed to risk associated with interest rates and value changes in foreign currencies which may adversely affect our business historically our reported net sales earnings cash flow and financial condition have been subjected to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates our primary exchange rate exposure is with the euro the british pound the argentine peso the brazilian real the chilean peso the canadian dollar and the mexican peso against the us dollar while we actively manage the exposure of our foreign currency risk as part of our overall financial risk management policy we believe we may experience losses from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and such losses could adversely affect our sales earnings cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

 

we are required to comply with increasingly stringent federal state and local environmental laws and regulations the cost of which is likely to increase and may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

 

our operations are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations these laws and regulations not only govern our current operations and products but also impose potential liability on us for our past operations we expect environmental laws and regulations to impose increasingly stringent requirements upon our industry and us in the future our costs to comply with these laws and regulations may increase as these requirements become more stringent in the future and these increased costs may adversely affect our results of operations cash flow or financial condition 

 

we are involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of our currently and formerly owned sites as well as a number of thirdparty sites for which our ultimate liability may exceed the current amount we have accrued 

 

we are involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of our currently and formerly owned sites and a number of thirdparty sites we accrue for estimated costs of investigation and remediation activities at these sites for which commitments or cleanup plans have been developed and when such costs can be reasonably estimated based on industry standards and professional judgment these estimated costs are based on currently available facts regarding each site we continuously assess our potential liability for investigation and remediation activities and adjust our environmentalrelated accruals as information becomes available upon which more accurate costs can be reasonably estimated due to the uncertainties surrounding environmental investigation and remediation activities our liability may result in costs that are significantly higher than currently accrued and may have an adverse affect on our earnings 

the nature cost quantity and outcome of pending and future litigation such as litigation arising from the historical manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paint could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity and financial condition 

 

in the course of our business we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits including litigation relating to product liability and warranty personal injury environmental intellectual property commercial contractual and antitrust claims that are inherently subject to many uncertainties regarding the possibility of a loss to us these uncertainties will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur confirming the incurrence of a liability or the reduction of a liability in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards fas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” we accrue for these contingencies by a charge to income when it is both probable that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact of a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated in the event that a loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently accrued the recording of the additional liability may result in a material impact on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such additional liability is accrued in those cases where no accrual is recorded because it is not probable that a liability has been incurred and cannot be reasonably estimated any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us may result in a material impact on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued in those cases where no accrual is recorded or exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued fas no 5 requires disclosure of the contingency when there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or additional loss may have been incurred if even the possibility may be remote 

 

our past operations included the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paints along with other companies we are a defendant in a number of legal proceedings including individual personal injury actions purported class actions and actions brought by various counties cities school districts and other governmentrelated entities arising from the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paints the plaintiffs are seeking recovery based upon various legal theories including negligence strict liability breach of warranty negligent misrepresentations and omissions fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions concert of action civil conspiracy violations of unfair trade practice and consumer protection laws enterprise liability market share liability public nuisance unjust enrichment and other theories the plaintiffs seek various damages and relief including personal injury and property damage costs relating to the detection and abatement of leadbased paint from buildings costs associated with a public education campaign medical monitoring costs and others we are also a defendant in legal proceedings arising from the manufacture and sale of nonleadbased paints which seek recovery based upon various legal theories including the failure to adequately warn of potential exposure to lead during surface preparation when using nonleadbased paint on surfaces previously painted with leadbased paint we believe that the litigation brought to date is without merit or subject to meritorious defenses and are vigorously defending such litigation we expect that additional lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation may be filed against us in the future asserting similar or different legal theories and seeking similar or different types of damages and relief 

 

notwithstanding our views on the merits litigation is inherently subject to many uncertainties and we ultimately may not prevail adverse court rulings such as the jury verdict against us and other defendants in the state of rhode island action and the wisconsin state supreme court’s determination that wisconsin’s risk contribution theory may apply in the lead pigment litigation or determinations of liability among other factors could affect the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation against us and encourage an increase in the number and nature of future claims and proceedings in addition from time to time various legislation and administrative regulations have been enacted promulgated or proposed to impose obligations on present and former manufacturers of lead pigments and leadbased paints respecting asserted health concerns associated with such products or to overturn the effect of court decisions in which we and other manufacturers have been successful 

 

due to the uncertainties involved management is unable to predict the outcome of the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation the number or nature of possible future claims and proceedings or the effect that any legislation andor administrative regulations may have on the litigation or against us in addition management cannot reasonably determine the scope or amount of the potential costs and liabilities related to such litigation or any such legislation and regulations we have not accrued any amounts for such litigation any potential liability that may result from such litigation or such legislation and regulations cannot reasonably be estimated in the event 

any significant liability is determined to be attributable to us relating to such litigation the recording of the liability may result in a material impact on net income for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued additionally due to the uncertainties associated with the amount of any such liability andor the nature of any other remedy which may be imposed in such litigation any potential liability determined to be attributable to us arising out of such litigation may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition an estimate of the potential impact on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition cannot be made due to the aforementioned uncertainties 

 

we discuss the risks and uncertainties related to litigation including the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation in more detail on page 18 of our 2008 annual report under the caption “litigation and other contingent liabilities” and pages 26 through 30 of our 2008 annual report under the caption “litigation” of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 62 through 66 of our 2008 annual report 

 

the costs or potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us through our ownership of life shield could have an adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition 

 

we own life shield engineered systems llc life shield develops and manufactures blast and fragment mitigating systems and ballistic resistant systems the blast and fragment mitigating systems and ballistic resistant systems create a potentially higher level of product liability for us than is normally associated with coatings and related products we manufacture distribute and sell depending upon the extent of any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us relating to life shield such liability could have an adverse effect on our results of operations cash flow liquidity or financial condition we discuss these risks and uncertainties in more detail on page 26 of our 2008 annual report under the caption “contingent liabilities” of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations”

basis of reportable segments 

 

we report our segment information in the same way that management internally organizes our business for assessing performance and making decisions regarding allocation of resources in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards fas no 131 “disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information” effective january 1 2006 we changed our reportable operating segments based on organizational changes in our management structure our reportable operating segments now are paint stores group consumer group and global group collectively the “reportable operating segments” the global group consists of certain business units with foreign or worldwide operations that were reported in the previous paint stores consumer automotive finishes and international coatings segments amounts reported prior to january 1 2006 have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation factors considered in determining our reportable operating segments include the nature of the business activities existence of managers responsible for the operating activities and information presented to our board of directors we report all other business activities and immaterial operating segments that are not reportable in the administrative segment 

 

the company’s chief operating decision maker codm has been identified as the chief executive officer because he has final authority over performance assessment and resource allocation decisions because of the diverse operations of the company the codm regularly receives discrete financial information about each reportable operating segment as well as a significant amount of additional financial information about certain divisions business units or subsidiaries of the company the codm uses all such financial information for performance assessment and resource allocation decisions the codm evaluates the performance of and allocates resources to the reportable operating segments based on profit or loss and cash generated from operations before income taxes the accounting policies of the reportable operating segments are the same as those described in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 47 through 51 of our 2007 annual report which is incorporated herein by reference

raw materials and products purchased for resale 

 

raw materials and fuel supplies are generally available from various sources in sufficient quantities that none of the reportable operating segments anticipate any significant sourcing problems during 2008 there are sufficient suppliers of each product purchased for resale that none of the reportable operating segments anticipate any significant sourcing problems during 2008 

 

seasonality 

 

the majority of the sales for the paint stores group consumer group and global group traditionally occur during the second and third quarters there is no significant seasonality in sales for the administrative segment 

 

working capital 

 

in order to meet increased demand during the second and third quarters the company usually builds its inventories during the first quarter working capital items inventory and receivables are generally financed through shortterm borrowings which include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of commercial paper for a description of the company’s liquidity and capital resources see pages 23 through 34 of our 2007 annual report under the caption entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” which is incorporated herein by reference 

 

trademarks and trade names 

 

customer recognition of our trademarks and trade names collectively contribute significantly to our sales the major trademarks and trade names used by each reportable operating segment are set forth below 

 

 3 

  

patents 

 

although patents and licenses are not of material importance to our business as a whole or any segment the international operations of the global group derive a portion of its income from the licensing of technology trademarks and trade names to foreign companies 

 

backlog and productive capacity 

 

backlog orders are not significant in the business of any reportable operating segment since there is normally a short period of time between the placing of an order and shipment we believe that sufficient productive capacity currently exists to fulfill our needs for paint coatings and related products through 2008 

 

research and development 

 

for information regarding our costs of research and development included in technical expenditures see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements on page 50 of our 2007 annual report which is incorporated herein by reference

cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking information 

 

certain statements contained in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” “business” and elsewhere in this report constitute “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 these forwardlooking statements are based upon management’s current expectations estimates assumptions and beliefs concerning future events and conditions and may discuss among other things anticipated future performance including sales and earnings expected growth future business plans and the costs and potential liability for environmentalrelated matters and the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation any statement that is not historical in nature is a forwardlooking statement and may be identified by the use of words and phrases such as “expects” “anticipates” “believes” “will” “will likely result” “will continue” “plans to” and similar expressions 

 

readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements are necessarily subject to risks uncertainties and other factors many of which are outside our control that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements and from our historical results and experience these risks uncertainties and other factors include such things as 

 

  

readers are cautioned that it is not possible to predict or identify all of the risks uncertainties and other factors that may affect future results and that the above list should not be considered to be a complete list any forwardlooking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statement whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 




 item 1a risk factors 

 

described below and elsewhere in this report and other documents that we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission are risks uncertainties and other factors that can adversely affect our business results of operation and financial condition the following are some of the more important of these risks uncertainties and other factors additional risks uncertainties and other factors that are currently not known to us or we believe are not currently material may also adversely affect our business results of operation and financial condition 

 

adverse changes in general business conditions in the united states and worldwide may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

 

adverse changes in general business conditions in the united states and worldwide may reduce the demand for some of our products and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition higher inflation rates interest rates tax rates and unemployment rates higher labor and healthcare costs recessions changing governmental policies laws and regulations and other economic factors that adversely affect the demand for our paint coatings and related products could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

 

economic downturns in cyclical segments of the economy may reduce the demand for some of our products and adversely affect our sales and earnings 

 

portions of our business involve the sale of paint coatings and related products to segments of the economy that are cyclical in nature particularly segments relating to construction housing and manufacturing our sales to these segments are affected by the levels of discretionary consumer and business spending in these segments during economic downturns in these segments the levels of consumer and business discretionary spending may decrease this decrease in spending will likely reduce the demand for some of our products and adversely affect our sales and earnings 

 

increases in the cost of raw materials and energy may adversely affect our earnings 

 

we purchase raw materials and energy for use in the manufacturing distribution and sale of our products factors such as adverse weather conditions including hurricanes and other disasters can disrupt raw material and fuel supplies and increase our costs although raw materials and energy supplies are generally available from various sources in sufficient quantities unexpected shortages and increases in the cost of raw materials and energy may have an adverse effect on our earnings in the event we are unable to offset these costs by sufficiently decreasing our operating costs or raising the prices of our products many of our paint and coatings products utilize titanium dioxide which is widely used as a white pigment for paint 

 

although we have an extensive customer base the loss of any of our largest customers could adversely affect our sales and earnings 

 

we have a large and varied customer base due to our extensive distribution network during 2007 no individual customer accounted for sales totaling more than ten percent of our sales however we have some customers that individually purchase a large amount of products from us although our broad distribution channels would help to minimize the impact of the loss of any one customer the loss of any of these large customers could have an adverse effect on our sales and earnings 

 

adverse weather conditions may reduce the demand for some of our products and could have a negative effect on our sales 

 

from time to time adverse weather conditions in certain parts of the united states have had an adverse effect on our sales of paint coatings and related products for example unusually cold and rainy weather especially during the exterior painting season could have an adverse effect on sales of our exterior paint products 

increased competition may reduce our sales and earnings performance 

 

we face substantial competition from many international national regional and local competitors of various sizes in the manufacture distribution and sale of our paint coatings and related products some of our competitors are larger than us and have greater financial resources to compete other competitors are smaller and may be able to offer more specialized products technology product quality product innovation breadth of product line technical expertise distribution service and price are the key competitive factors for our business competition in any of these areas may reduce our sales and adversely affect our earnings by resulting in decreased sales volumes reduced prices and increased costs of manufacturing distributing and selling our products 

 

our operating results and financial condition may be negatively impacted if we do not successfully integrate past and future acquisitions into our existing operations and if the performance of the businesses we acquire do not meet our expectations 

 

we have historically made strategic acquisitions of businesses in the paint and coatings industry and will likely acquire additional businesses in the future as part of our long term growth strategy these acquisitions involve challenges and risks in the event that we do not successfully integrate these acquisitions into our existing operations so as to realize the expected return on our investment our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

 

risks and uncertainties associated with our expansion into and our operations in china india south america and other foreign markets could adversely affect our sales and earnings 

 

net external sales of our consolidated foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately 965 million in 2007 or 121 of our total consolidated net sales sales outside of the united states make up an important part of our current business and future strategic plans our sales and earnings could be adversely affected by a variety of international factors including general economic conditions inflation rates recessions foreign currency exchange rates foreign investment and repatriation restrictions legal and regulatory constraints civil unrest difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and other external economic and political factors our inability to successfully manage the risks and uncertainties relating to these factors could adversely affect our sales and earnings 

 

in many foreign countries it is acceptable to engage in certain business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in because of regulations that are applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act although we have internal control policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these regulations there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prevent a violation of these regulations any violation could cause an adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our sales and earnings 

 

because of our international operations we are exposed to risk associated with interest rates and value changes in foreign currencies which may adversely affect our business historically our reported net sales and net earnings have been subjected to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates our primary exchange rate exposure is with the euro the british pound the argentine peso the brazilian real the chilean peso the canadian dollar and the mexican peso against the us dollar while we actively manage the exposure of our foreign currency risk as part of our overall financial risk management policy we believe we may experience losses from foreign currency translation and such losses could adversely affect our sales and earnings 

 

we are required to comply with increasingly stringent federal state and local environmental laws and regulations the cost of which is likely to increase and may adversely affect our earnings 

 

our operations are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations these laws and regulations not only govern our current operations and products but also impose potential liability on us for our past operations we expect environmental laws and regulations to impose increasingly stringent requirements upon our industry and us in the future our costs to comply with these laws and regulations may increase as these requirements become more stringent in the future and these increased costs may adversely affect our earnings 

we are involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of our currently and formerly owned sites as well as a number of thirdparty sites for which our ultimate liability may exceed the current amount we have accrued 

 

we are involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of our currently and formerly owned sites and a number of thirdparty sites we accrue for estimated costs of investigation and remediation activities at these sites for which commitments or cleanup plans have been developed and when such costs can be reasonably estimated based on industry standards and professional judgment these estimated costs are based on currently available facts regarding each site we continuously assess our potential liability for investigation and remediation activities and adjust our environmentalrelated accruals as information becomes available upon which more accurate costs can be reasonably estimated due to the uncertainties surrounding environmental investigation and remediation activities our liability may result in costs that are significantly higher than currently accrued and may have an adverse affect on our earnings 

 

the nature cost quantity and outcome of pending and future litigation such as litigation arising from the historical manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paint could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

 

in the course of our business we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits including litigation relating to product liability and warranty personal injury environmental intellectual property commercial contractual and antitrust claims that are inherently subject to many uncertainties regarding the possibility of a loss to us these uncertainties will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur confirming the incurrence of a liability or the reduction of a liability in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards fas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” we accrue for these contingencies by a charge to income when it is both probable that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact of a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated in the event that a loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently accrued the recording of the additional liability may result in a material impact on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such additional liability is accrued in those cases where no accrual is recorded because it is not probable that a liability has been incurred and cannot be reasonably estimated any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us may result in a material impact on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued in those cases where no accrual is recorded or exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued fas no 5 requires disclosure of the contingency when there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or additional loss may have been incurred if even the possibility may be remote 

 

our past operations included the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paints along with other companies we are a defendant in a number of legal proceedings including individual personal injury actions purported class actions actions brought by the state of rhode island and the state of ohio and actions brought by various counties cities school districts and other governmentrelated entities arising from the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paints the plaintiffs are seeking recovery based upon various legal theories including negligence strict liability breach of warranty negligent misrepresentations and omissions fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions concert of action civil conspiracy violations of unfair trade practice and consumer protection laws enterprise liability market share liability public nuisance unjust enrichment and other theories the plaintiffs seek various damages and relief including personal injury and property damage costs relating to the detection and abatement of leadbased paint from buildings costs associated with a public education campaign medical monitoring costs and others we are also a defendant in legal proceedings arising from the manufacture and sale of nonleadbased paints which seek recovery based upon various legal theories including the failure to adequately warn of potential exposure to lead during surface preparation when using nonleadbased paint on surfaces previously painted with leadbased paint we believe that the litigation brought to date is without merit or subject to meritorious defenses and are vigorously defending such litigation we expect that additional lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation may be filed against us in the future asserting similar or different legal theories and seeking similar or different types of damages and relief 

 

during september 2002 a jury trial commenced in the first phase of an action brought by the state of rhode island against us and the other defendants the sole issue before the court in this first phase was whether lead 

pigment in paint constitutes a public nuisance under rhode island law in october 2002 the court declared a mistrial as the jury which was split four to two in favor of the defendants was unable to reach a unanimous decision 

 

the state of rhode island retried the case and on february 22 2006 the jury returned a verdict finding that i the cumulative presence of lead pigment in paints and coatings on buildings in the state of rhode island constitutes a public nuisance ii we along with two other defendants caused or substantially contributed to the creation of the public nuisance and iii we and two other defendants should be ordered to abate the public nuisance on february 28 2006 the court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss the punitive damages claim finding insufficient evidence to support the state’s request for punitive damages on february 26 2007 the court issued a decision on the posttrial motions and other matters pending before the court specifically the court i denied the defendant’s posttrial motions for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial ii decided to enter a judgment of abatement in favor of the state against us and two other defendants and iii decided to appoint a special master for the purpose of assisting the court in its consideration of a remedial order to implement the judgment of abatement and if necessary any monitoring of the implementation of that order on march 16 2007 final judgment was entered against us and two other defendants also on march 16 2007 we filed our notice of appeal to the rhode island supreme court oral argument on our and the other two defendants’ appeal to the rhode island supreme court is scheduled for may 2008 proceedings relating to a remedial order to implement the judgment of abatement are continuing in the court during the pending appeal to the rhode island supreme court 

 

we cannot reasonably determine the impact that the state of rhode island decision and determination of liability will have on the number or nature of present or future claims and proceedings against us or estimate the amount or range of ultimate loss that we may incur 

 

notwithstanding our views on the merits litigation is inherently subject to many uncertainties and we ultimately may not prevail adverse court rulings such as the judgment against us and other defendants in the state of rhode island action and the wisconsin state supreme court’s july 2005 determination that wisconsin’s risk contribution theory may apply in the lead pigment litigation or determinations of liability among other factors could affect the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation against us and encourage an increase in the number and nature of future claims and proceedings in addition from time to time various legislation and administrative regulations have been enacted promulgated or proposed to impose obligations on present and former manufacturers of lead pigments and leadbased paints respecting asserted health concerns associated with such products or to overturn the effect of court decisions in which we and other manufacturers have been successful 

 

due to the uncertainties involved management is unable to predict the outcome of the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation the number or nature of possible future claims and proceedings or the effect that any legislation andor administrative regulations may have on the litigation or against us in addition management cannot reasonably determine the scope or amount of the potential costs and liabilities related to such litigation or any such legislation and regulations in accordance with fas no 5 we have not accrued any amounts for such litigation any potential liability that may result from such litigation or such legislation and regulations cannot reasonably be estimated in the event any significant liability is determined to be attributable to us relating to such litigation the recording of the liability may result in a material impact on net income for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued additionally due to the uncertainties associated with the amount of any such liability andor the nature of any other remedy which may be imposed in such litigation any potential liability determined to be attributable to us arising out of such litigation may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition an estimate of the potential impact on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition cannot be made due to the aforementioned uncertainties

internally organizes its business for assessing performance and making decisions regarding allocation of resources in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards fas no 131 “disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information” effective january 1 2006 we changed our reportable operating segments based on organizational changes in our management structure our reportable operating segments now are paint stores group consumer group and global group collectively the “reportable operating segments” the global group consists of certain business units with foreign or worldwide operations that were reported in the previous paint stores consumer automotive finishes and international coatings segments amounts previously reported have been reclassified to conform with the 2006 presentation factors considered in determining our three reportable operating segments include the nature of the business activities existence of managers responsible for the operating activities and information presented to the board of directors we report all other business activities and immaterial operating segments that are not reportable in the administrative segment   the company’s chief operating decision maker codm has been identified as the chief executive officer because he has final authority over performance assessment and resource allocation decisions because of the diverse operations of the company the codm regularly receives discrete financial information about each reportable operating segment as well as a significant amount of additional financial information about certain divisions business units or subsidiaries of the company the codm uses all such financial information for performance assessment and resource allocation decisions the codm evaluates the performance of and allocates resources to the reportable operating segments based on profit or loss and cash generated from operations before income taxes the accounting policies of the reportable operating segments are the same as those described in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 47 through 51 of our 2006 annual report which is incorporated herein by reference 1 paint stores group   the paint stores group consisted of 3046 companyoperated specialty paint stores in the united states canada virgin islands and puerto rico at

in 2005 there were 95 net new stores opened 88 in the united states in 2004 there were 297 net new stores opened or acquired 294 in the united states the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on the business of this segment consumer group   the consumer group develops manufactures and distributes a variety of paint coatings and related products to third party customers and the paint stores group primarily in the united states and canada the acquisition of susannah dobbs company llc in 2006 was included in this segment approximately 55 percent of the total sales of the consumer group in 2006 including intersegment transfers represented products sold through the paint stores group sales and marketing of certain controlled brand and private labeled products is performed by a direct sales staff the products distributed through third party customers are intended for resale to the ultimate enduser of the product the consumer group had sales to certain customers that individually may be a significant portion of the sales of the segment however the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on the overall profitability of the segment this segment incurred most of the company’s capital expenditures related to ongoing environmental compliance measures global group   the global group develops licenses manufactures distributes and sells a variety of architectural paint and coatings industrial and marine products automotive finishes and refinish products oem coatings and related products in north and south america jamaica the united kingdom europe and china this segment meets the demands of its customers for a consistent worldwide product development manufacturing and distribution presence and

administrative segment was a real estate management unit that is responsible for the ownership management and leasing of nonretail properties held primarily for use by the company including the company’s headquarters site and disposal of idle facilities sales of this segment represented external leasing revenue of excess headquarters space or leasing of facilities no longer used by the company in its operations gains and losses from the sale of property were not a significant operating factor in determining the performance of the administrative segment 2 segment financial

of our 2006 annual report and the “letter to shareholders” on pages 2 through 5 of our 2006 annual report which is incorporated herein by reference raw materials and products purchased for resale   raw materials and fuel supplies are generally available from various sources in sufficient quantities that none of the reportable operating segments anticipate any significant sourcing problems during 2007 there are sufficient suppliers of each product purchased for resale that none of the reportable operating segments anticipate any significant sourcing problems during 2007 seasonality   the majority of the sales for the paint stores group consumer group and global group traditionally occur during the second and third quarters there is no significant seasonality in sales for the administrative segment working capital   in order to meet increased demand during the second and third quarters the company usually builds its inventories during the first quarter working capital items inventory and receivables are generally financed through shortterm borrowings which include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of commercial paper for a description of the company’s liquidity and capital resources see pages 23 through 33 of our 2006 annual report under the caption entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” which is incorporated herein by reference trademarks and trade names   customer recognition of our trademarks and trade names collectively contribute significantly to our sales the major trademarks and trade names used by each reportable operating segment are set forth below  3  patents   although patents and licenses are not of material importance to our business as a whole or any segment the international operations of the global group derive a portion of its income from the licensing of technology trademarks and trade names to foreign companies backlog and productive capacity   backlog orders are not significant in the business of any reportable operating segment since there is normally a short period of time between the placing of an order and shipment sufficient productive capacity currently exists to fulfill our needs for paint coatings and related products through 2007 research and development   for information regarding our costs of research and development included in technical expenditures see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements on page 50 of our 2006 annual report which is incorporated herein by reference competition   we experience competition from many local regional national and international competitors of various sizes in the manufacture distribution and sale of our paint coatings and related products we are a leading manufacturer and retailer of paint coatings and related products to professional industrial commercial and retail customers however our competitive position varies for our different products and markets   in the paint stores group competitors include other paint and wallpaper stores mass merchandisers home centers independent hardware stores hardware chains and manufactureroperated direct outlets product quality service and price determine the competitive advantage for this segment   in the consumer group domestic and foreign competitors include manufacturers and distributors of branded and private labeled paint and coatings products technology product quality product innovation breadth of product line technical expertise distribution service and price are the key competitive factors for this segment   the global group has numerous competitors in its domestic and foreign markets with broad product offerings and several others with niche products key competitive factors for this segment include technology product quality product innovation breadth of product line technical expertise distribution service and price   the administrative segment has many competitors consisting of other real estate owners developers and managers in areas in which this segment owns property the main competitive factors are the availability of property and price employees   we employed 30767 persons at december 31 2006 environmental compliance   for additional information regarding environmentalrelated matters see pages 25 through 27 of our 2006 annual report under the

 item 1a risk factors   described below and elsewhere in this report and other documents that we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission are risks uncertainties and other factors that can adversely affect our business results of operation and financial condition the following are some of the more important of these risks uncertainties and other factors additional risks uncertainties and other factors that are currently not known to us or we believe are not currently material may also adversely affect our business results of operation and financial condition adverse changes in general business conditions in the united states and worldwide may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition   adverse changes in general business conditions in the united states and worldwide may reduce the demand for some of our products and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition higher inflation rates interest rates tax rates and unemployment rates higher labor and healthcare costs recessions changing governmental policies laws and regulations and other economic factors that adversely affect the demand for our paint coatings and related products could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition economic downturns in cyclical segments of the economy may reduce the demand for some of our products and adversely affect our sales and earnings   portions of our business involve the sale of paint coatings and related products to segments of the economy that are cyclical in nature particularly segments relating to construction housing and manufacturing our sales to these segments are affected by the levels of discretionary consumer and business spending in these segments during economic downturns in these segments the levels of consumer and business discretionary spending may decrease this decrease in spending will likely reduce the demand for some of our products and adversely affect our sales and earnings increases in the cost of raw materials and energy may adversely affect our earnings   we purchase raw materials and energy for use in the manufacturing distribution and sale of our products factors such as adverse weather conditions including hurricanes and other disasters can disrupt raw material and fuel supplies and increase our costs although raw materials and energy supplies are generally available from various sources in sufficient quantities unexpected shortages and increases in the cost of raw materials and energy may have an adverse effect on our earnings in the event we are unable to offset these costs by sufficiently decreasing our operating costs or raising the prices of our products many of our paint and coatings products utilize titanium dioxide which is widely used as a white pigment for paint during 2006 we experienced significant cost increases in energy and raw materials particularly titanium dioxide and petroleumbased materials which adversely impacted our earnings although we have an extensive customer base the loss of any of our largest customers could adversely affect our sales and earnings   we have a large and varied customer base due to our extensive distribution network during 2006 no individual customer accounted for sales totaling more than ten percent of our sales however we have some customers that individually purchase a large amount of products from us although our broad distribution channels would help to minimize the impact of the loss of any one customer the loss of any of these large customers could have an adverse effect on our sales and earnings 6 adverse weather conditions may reduce the demand for some of our products and could have a negative effect on our sales   from time to time adverse weather conditions in certain parts of the united states have had an adverse effect on our sales of paint coatings and related products for example unusually cold and rainy weather especially during the exterior painting season could have an adverse effect on sales of our exterior paint products increased competition may reduce our sales and earnings performance   we face substantial competition from many international national regional and local competitors of various sizes in the manufacture distribution and sale of our paint coatings and related products some of our competitors are larger than us and have greater financial resources to compete other competitors are smaller and may be able to offer more specialized products technology product quality product innovation breadth of product line technical expertise distribution service and price are the key competitive factors for our business competition in any of these areas may reduce our sales and adversely affect our earnings by resulting in decreased sales volumes reduced prices and increased costs of manufacturing distributing and selling our products our operating results and financial condition may be negatively impacted if we do not successfully integrate past and future acquisitions into our existing operations and if the performance of the businesses we acquire do not meet our expectations   we have historically made strategic acquisitions of businesses in the paint and coatings industry and will likely acquire additional businesses in the future as part of our long term growth strategy these acquisitions involve significant challenges and risks in the event that we do not successfully integrate these acquisitions into our existing operations so as to realize the expected return on our investment our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected risks and uncertainties associated with our expansion into and our operations in china south america and other foreign markets could adversely affect our sales and earnings   net external sales of our consolidated foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately 831 million in 2006 or 106 of our total consolidated net sales sales outside of the united states make up an important part of our current business and future strategic plans our sales and earnings could be adversely affected by a variety of international factors including general economic conditions inflation rates recessions foreign currency exchange rates foreign investment and repatriation restrictions legal and regulatory constraints civil unrest difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and other external economic and political factors our inability to successfully manage the risks and uncertainties relating to these factors could adversely affect our sales and earnings   in many foreign countries it is acceptable to engage in certain business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in because of regulations that are applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act although we have internal control policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these regulations there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prevent a violation of these regulations any violation could cause an adverse effect on our results of operations fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our sales and earnings   because of our international operations we are exposed to market risk associated with interest rates and value changes in foreign currencies which may adversely affect our business historically our reported net sales and net earnings have been subjected to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates our primary exchange rate exposure is with the british pound the argentine peso the brazilian real the chilean peso the canadian dollar and the mexican peso against the us dollar while we actively manage the exposure of our foreign currency market risk as part of our overall financial risk management policy we believe we may experience continuing losses from foreign currency translation and such losses could adversely affect our sales and earnings 7 we are required to comply with increasingly stringent federal state and local environmental laws and regulations the cost of which is likely to increase and may adversely affect our earnings   our operations are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations these laws and regulations not only govern our current operations and products but also impose potential liability on us for our past operations we expect environmental laws and regulations to impose increasingly stringent requirements upon our industry and us in the future our costs to comply with these laws and regulations may increase as these requirements become more stringent in the future and these increased costs may adversely affect our earnings we are involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of our current and former sites as well as a number of thirdparty sites for which our ultimate liability may exceed the current amount we have accrued   we are involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of our current and former sites and a number of thirdparty sites we accrue for estimated costs of investigation and remediation activities at these sites for which commitments or cleanup plans have been developed and when such costs can be reasonably estimated based on industry standards and professional judgment these estimated costs are based on currently available facts regarding each site we continuously assess our potential liability for investigation and remediation activities and adjust our environmentalrelated accruals as information becomes available upon which more accurate costs can be reasonably estimated due to the uncertainties surrounding environmental investigation and remediation activities our liability may result in costs that are significantly higher than currently accrued and may have an adverse affect on our earnings the nature cost quantity and outcome of pending and future litigation such as litigation arising from the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paint could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition   in the course of our business we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits including litigation relating to product liability and warranty personal injury environmental intellectual property commercial contractual and antitrust claims we accrue for these contingencies when it is probable that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact of a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated however because litigation is inherently subject to many uncertainties and the ultimate result of any present or future litigation is unpredictable our ultimate liability may result in costs that are significantly higher than currently accrued in the event that our loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently accrued the recording of the liability may result in a material impact on net income for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued additionally due to the uncertainties involved any potential liability determined to be attributable to us arising out of such litigation may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition   our past operations included the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paints along with other companies we are a defendant in a number of legal proceedings including purported class actions separate actions brought by the state of rhode island and actions brought by various counties cities school districts and other governmentrelated entities arising from the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paints we are also a defendant in legal proceedings arising from the manufacture and sale of nonleadbased paints which seek recovery based upon various legal theories including the failure to adequately warn of potential exposure to lead during surface preparation when using nonleadbased paint on surfaces previously painted with leadbased paint we expect that additional lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation may be filed against us in the future asserting similar or different legal theories and seeking similar or different types of damages and relief   during september 2002 a jury trial commenced in the first phase of the action brought by the state of rhode island against us and the other defendants the sole issue in this first phase was whether lead pigment in paint constitutes a public nuisance under rhode island law in october 2002 the court declared a mistrial as the jury which was split four to two in favor of the defendants was unable to reach a unanimous decision   the state of rhode island retried the case and on february 22 2006 the jury returned a verdict finding that 1 the cumulative presence of lead pigment in paints and coatings on buildings in the state of rhode island 8 constitutes a public nuisance ii we along with two other defendants caused or substantially contributed to the creation of the public nuisance and iii we and two other defendants should be ordered to abate the public nuisance on february 26 2007 the court issued a decision on the posttrial motions and other matters pending before the court specifically the court i denied the defendants’ posttrial motions for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial ii decided to enter a judgment of abatement in favor of the state against us and two other defendants and iii decided to appoint a special master for the purpose of assisting the court in its consideration of a remedial order to implement the judgment of abatement and if necessary any monitoring of the implementation of that order we intend to appeal the jury’s verdict and the court’s decision 

  litigation is inherently subject to many uncertainties adverse court rulings such as the rhode island jury verdict and the wisconsin state supreme court’s determination in july 2005 that wisconsin’s risk contribution theory may apply to the lead pigment litigation or determinations of liability among other factors could affect the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation against us and encourage an increase in the number and nature of future claims and proceedings in addition from time to time various legislation and administrative regulations have been enacted or proposed to impose obligations on present and former manufacturers of lead pigments and leadbased paints respecting asserted health concerns associated with such products and to overturn court decisions in which we and other manufacturers have been successful we cannot reasonably determine the impact that the state of rhode island decision and determination of liability will have on the number or nature of present or future claims and proceedings against us   due to the uncertainties involved management is unable to predict the outcome of the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation the number or nature of possible future claims and proceedings or the effect that any legislation andor administrative regulations may have on the litigation or against us in addition management cannot reasonably determine the scope or amount of the potential costs and liabilities related to such litigation or any such legislation and regulations we have not accrued any amounts for such litigation any potential liability that may result from such litigation or such legislation and regulations cannot reasonably be estimated in the event any significant liability is determined to be attributable to us relating to such litigation the recording of the liability may result in a material impact on net income for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued additionally due to the uncertainties associated with the amount of any such liability andor the nature of any other remedy which may be imposed in such litigation any potential liability determined to be attributable to us arising out of such litigation may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition an estimate of the potential impact on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition cannot be made due to the aforementioned uncertainties   we discuss the risks and uncertainties related to litigation including the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation in more detail on pages 21 and 22 of our 2006 annual report under the caption “litigation and other contingent liabilities” and pages 29 through 33 of our 2006 annual report under the caption “litigation” of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages 65 through 68 of our 2006 annual report the costs or potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us through our ownership of life shield could have an adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition   we own a 25 interest in life shield engineered systems llc and are obligated to acquire an additional 24 interest in life shield in october 2007 life shield is a startup company that develops and manufactures blast and fragment mitigating systems and ballistic resistant systems the blast and fragment mitigating systems and ballistic resistant systems create a potentially higher level of product liability for us than is normally associated with coatings and related products we manufacture distribute and sell depending upon the extent of any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us relating to life shield such liability could have an adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition we discuss these risks and uncertainties in more detail on page 29 of our 2006 annual report under the caption entitled “contingent liabilities” of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 9

traditionally been greater than the sales for any of the first three quarters there is no significant seasonality in sales for the administrative segment working capital   in order to meet increased demand during the second and third quarters the company usually builds its inventories during the first quarter working capital items inventory and receivables are generally financed through shortterm borrowings which include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of commercial paper for a description of the company’s liquidity and capital resources see pages 24 through 32 of our 2005 annual

finishes segment derive a portion of their income from the licensing of technology trademarks and trade names to foreign companies backlog and productive capacity   backlog orders are not significant

 item 1a risk factors   described below and elsewhere in this report and other documents that we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission are risks uncertainties and other factors that can adversely affect our business results of operation and financial condition the following are some of the more important of these risks uncertainties and other factors additional risks uncertainties and other factors that are currently not known to us or we believe are not currently material may also adversely affect our business results of operation and financial condition adverse changes in general business conditions in the united states and worldwide may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition   adverse changes in general business conditions in the united states and worldwide may reduce the demand for some of our products and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition higher inflation rates interest rates tax rates and unemployment rates higher labor and healthcare costs recessions changing governmental policies laws and regulations and other economic factors that adversely affect the demand for our paint coatings and related products could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition economic downturns in cyclical segments of the economy may reduce the demand for some of our products and adversely affect our sales and earnings   portions of our business involve the sale of paint coatings and related products to segments of the economy that are cyclical in nature particularly segments relating to construction housing and manufacturing our sales to these segments are affected by the levels of discretionary consumer and business spending in these segments during economic downturns in these segments the levels of consumer and business discretionary spending may decrease this decrease in spending will likely reduce the demand for some of our products and adversely affect our sales and earnings increases in the cost of raw materials and energy may adversely affect our earnings   we purchase raw materials and energy for use in the manufacturing distribution and sale of our products factors such as adverse weather conditions including hurricanes and other disasters can disrupt raw material and fuel supplies and increase our costs although raw materials and energy supplies are generally available from various sources in sufficient quantities unexpected shortages and increases in the cost of raw materials and energy may have an adverse effect on our earnings in the event we are unable to offset these costs by sufficiently decreasing our operating costs or raising the prices of our products many of our paint and coatings products utilize titanium dioxide which is widely used as a white pigment for paint during 2005 we experienced significant cost increases in energy and raw materials particularly titanium dioxide and petroleumbased materials which adversely impacted our earnings 6 although we have an extensive customer base the loss of any of our largest customers could adversely affect our sales and earnings   we have a large and varied customer base due to our extensive distribution network during 2005 no individual customer accounted for sales totaling more than ten percent of our sales however we have some customers that individually purchase a large amount of products from us although our broad distribution channels would help to minimize the impact of the loss of any one customer the loss of any of these large customers could have an adverse effect on our sales and earnings adverse weather conditions may reduce the demand for some of our products and could have a negative effect on our sales   from time to time adverse weather conditions in certain parts of the united states have had an adverse effect on our sales of paint coatings and related products for example unusually cold and rainy weather especially during the exterior painting season could have an adverse effect on sales of our exterior paint products increased competition may reduce our sales and earnings performance   we face substantial competition from many international national regional and local competitors of various sizes in the manufacture distribution and sale of our paint coatings and related products some of our competitors are larger than us and have greater financial resources to compete other competitors are smaller and may be able to offer more specialized products technology product quality product innovation breadth of product line technical expertise distribution service and price are the key competitive factors for our business competition in any of these areas may reduce our sales and adversely affect our earnings by resulting in decreased sales volumes reduced prices and increased costs of manufacturing distributing and selling our products our operating results and financial condition may be negatively impacted if we do not successfully integrate past and future acquisitions into our existing operations and if the performance of the businesses we acquire do not meet our expectations   we have historically made strategic acquisitions of businesses in the paint and coatings industry and will likely acquire additional businesses in the future as part of our long term growth strategy these acquisitions involve significant challenges and risks in the event that we do not successfully integrate these acquisitions into our existing operations so as to realize the expected return on our investment our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected risks and uncertainties associated with our expansion into and our operations in china south america and other foreign markets could adversely affect our sales and earnings   net external sales of our consolidated foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately 747 million in 2005 or 104 of our total consolidated net sales sales outside of the united states make up an important part of our current business and future strategic plans our sales and earnings could be adversely affected by a variety of international factors including general economic conditions inflation rates recessions foreign currency exchange rates foreign investment and repatriation restrictions legal and regulatory constraints civil unrest difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and other external economic and political factors our inability to successfully manage the risks and uncertainties relating to these factors could adversely affect our sales and earnings   in many foreign countries it is acceptable to engage in certain business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in because of regulations that are applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act although we have internal control policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these regulations there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prevent a violation of these regulations any violation could cause an adverse effect on our results of operations 7 fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our sales and earnings   because of our international operations we are exposed to market risk associated with interest rates and value changes in foreign currencies which may adversely affect our business historically our reported net sales and net earnings have been subjected to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates our primary exchange rate exposure is with the british pound the argentine peso the brazilian real the chilean peso the canadian dollar and the mexican peso against the us dollar while we actively manage the exposure of our foreign currency market risk as part of our overall financial risk management policy we believe we may experience continuing losses from foreign currency translation and such losses could adversely affect our sales and earnings we are required to comply with increasingly stringent federal state and local environmental laws and regulations the cost of which is likely to increase and may adversely affect our earnings   our operations are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations these laws and regulations not only govern our current operations and products but also impose potential liability on us for our past operations we expect environmental laws and regulations to impose increasingly stringent requirements upon our industry and us in the future our costs to comply with these laws and regulations may increase as these requirements become more stringent in the future and these increased costs may adversely affect our earnings we are involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of our current and former sites as well as a number of thirdparty sites for which our ultimate liability may exceed the current amount we have accrued   we are involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of our current and former sites and a number of thirdparty sites we accrue for estimated costs of investigation and remediation activities at these sites for which commitments or cleanup plans have been developed and when such costs can be reasonably estimated based on industry standards and professional judgment these estimated costs are based on currently available facts regarding each site we continuously assess our potential liability for investigation and remediation activities and adjust our environmentalrelated accruals as information becomes available upon which more accurate costs can be reasonably estimated due to the uncertainties surrounding environmental investigation and remediation activities our liability may result in costs that are significantly higher than currently accrued and may have an adverse affect on our earnings the nature cost quantity and outcome of pending and future litigation such as litigation arising from the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paint could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition   in the course of our business we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits including litigation relating to product liability and warranty personal injury environmental intellectual property commercial contractual and antitrust claims we accrue for these contingencies consistent with the policy stated on page 30 of our 2005 annual report under the caption entitled “contingent liabilities” of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” however because litigation is inherently subject to many uncertainties and the ultimate result of any present or future litigation is unpredictable our ultimate liability may result in costs that are significantly higher than currently accrued in the event that our loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently accrued the recording of the liability may result in a material impact on net income for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued additionally due to the uncertainties involved any potential liability determined to be attributable to us arising out of such litigation may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition   our past operations included the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paints along with other companies we are a defendant in a number of legal proceedings including purported class actions separate actions brought by the state of rhode island and actions brought by various counties cities school districts and other governmentrelated entities arising from the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and leadbased paints we are also a defendant in legal proceedings arising from the manufacture and sale of nonleadbased paints 8 which seek recovery based upon various legal theories including the failure to adequately warn of potential exposure to lead during surface preparation when using nonleadbased paint on surfaces previously painted with leadbased paint we expect that additional lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation may be filed against us in the future asserting similar or different legal theories and seeking similar or different types of damages and relief 

  during september 2002 a jury trial commenced in the first phase of the action brought by the state of rhode island against us and the other defendants the sole issue before the court in this first phase was whether lead pigment in paint constitutes a public nuisance under rhode island law in october 2002 the court declared a mistrial as the jury which was split four to two in favor of the defendants was unable to reach a unanimous decision   the state of rhode island retried the case and on february 22 2006 the jury returned a verdict finding that 1 the cumulative presence of lead pigment in paints and coatings on buildings in the state of rhode island constitutes a public nuisance ii we along with two other defendants caused or substantially contributed to the creation of the public nuisance and iii we and two other defendants should be ordered to abate the public nuisance the court will determine the scope of the abatement remedy various other matters remain before the court we intend to appeal the jury’s verdict   this was the first legal proceeding against us to go to trial relating to the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation we believe it is possible that additional legal proceedings could be scheduled for trial in 2006 and in subsequent years in other jurisdictions   litigation is inherently subject to many uncertainties adverse court rulings such as the rhode island jury verdict and the wisconsin state supreme court’s determination in july 2005 that wisconsin’s risk contribution theory applies to the lead pigment litigation or determinations of liability among other factors could affect the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation against us and encourage an increase in the number and nature of future claims and proceedings in addition from time to time various legislation and administrative regulations have been enacted or proposed to impose obligations on present and former manufacturers of lead pigments and leadbased paints respecting asserted health concerns associated with such products and to overturn court decisions in which we and other manufacturers have been successful we cannot reasonably determine the impact that the state of rhode island decision and determination of liability will have on the number or nature of present or future claims and proceedings against us   due to the uncertainties involved management is unable to predict the outcome of the lead pigment and leadbased paint litigation the number or nature of possible future claims and proceedings or the effect that any legislation andor administrative regulations may have on the litigation or against us in addition management cannot reasonably determine the scope or amount of the potential costs and liabilities related to such litigation or any such legislation and regulations we have not accrued any amounts for such litigation any potential liability that may result from such litigation or such legislation and regulations cannot reasonably be estimated in the event any significant liability is determined to be attributable to us relating to such litigation the recording of the liability may result in a material impact on net income for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued additionally due to the uncertainties associated with the amount of any such liability andor the nature of any other remedy which may be imposed in such litigation any potential liability determined to be attributable to us arising out of such litigation may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition an estimate of the potential impact on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition cannot be made due to the aforementioned uncertainties   we discuss this litigation in more detail on pages 31 and 32 of our 2005 annual report under the caption entitled “litigation” of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and in note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements on page 72 of our 2005 annual report 9 the costs or potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us through our ownership of life shield could have an adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition   we own a 25 interest in life shield engineered systems llc and are obligated to acquire an additional 24 interest in life shield in october 2007 life shield is a startup company that develops and manufactures blast and fragment mitigating systems and ballistic resistant systems the blast and fragment mitigating systems and ballistic resistant systems create a potentially higher level of product liability for us than is normally associated with coatings and related products we manufacture distribute and sell depending upon the extent of any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us relating to life shield such liability could have an adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition we discuss the risks and uncertainties relating to our ownership of life shield in more detail on page 30 of our

traditionally been greater than the sales for any of the first three quarters there is no significant seasonality in sales for the administrative segment working capital   in order to meet increased demand during the second and third quarters the company usually builds its inventories during the first quarter working capital items inventory and receivables are generally financed through shortterm borrowings which include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of commercial paper for a description of the company’s liquidity and capital resources see pages 25 through 31 of our 2004 annual
